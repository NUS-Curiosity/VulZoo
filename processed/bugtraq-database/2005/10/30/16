Synopsis
========

Ethereal is vulnerable to numerous vulnerabilities, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code or abnormal termination.

Background
==========

Ethereal is a feature-rich network protocol analyzer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /   Vulnerable   /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/ethereal     < 0.10.13-r1              >= 0.10.13-r1

Description
===========

There are numerous vulnerabilities in versions of Ethereal prior to
0.10.13, including:

* The SLIM3 and AgentX dissectors could overflow a buffer
  (CVE-2005-3243).

* iDEFENSE discovered a buffer overflow in the SRVLOC dissector
  (CVE-2005-3184).

* Multiple potential crashes in many dissectors have been fixed, see
  References for further details.

Furthermore an infinite loop was discovered in the IRC protocol
dissector of the 0.10.13 release (CVE-2005-3313).

Impact
======

An attacker might be able to use these vulnerabilities to crash
Ethereal or execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running Ethereal, which could be the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ethereal users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/ethereal-0.10.13-r1"
