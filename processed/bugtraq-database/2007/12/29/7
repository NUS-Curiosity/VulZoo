Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in ClamAV allowing remote
execution of arbitrary code and Denial of Service attacks.

Background
==========

Clam AntiVirus is a free anti-virus toolkit for UNIX, designed
especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /   Vulnerable   /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/clamav      < 0.91.2-r1                >= 0.91.2-r1

Description
===========

iDefense reported an integer overflow vulnerability in the cli_scanpe()
function when parsing Portable Executable (PE) files packed in the MEW
format, that could be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow
(CVE-2007-6335). Toeroek Edwin reported an off-by-one error when
decompressing MS-ZIP compressed CAB files (CVE-2007-6336). An
unspecified vulnerability related to the bzip2 decompression algorithm
has also been discovered (CVE-2007-6337).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to scan a
specially crafted file, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running ClamAV (either a system
user or the "clamav" user if clamd is compromised).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ClamAV users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=app-antivirus/clamav-0.91.2-r1"
