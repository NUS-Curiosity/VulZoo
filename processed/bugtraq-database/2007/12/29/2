Synopsis
========

An integer overflow vulnerability in Exiv2 possibly allows for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Exiv2 is a C++ library and set of tools for parsing, editing and saving
Exif and IPTC metadata from images. Exif, the Exchangeable image file
format, specifies the addition of metadata tags to JPEG, TIFF and RIFF
files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/exiv2      < 0.13-r1                         >= 0.13-r1

Description
===========

Meder Kydyraliev (Google Security) discovered an integer overflow
vulnerability in the JpegThumbnail::setDataArea() method leading to a
heap-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice the user of an application making use of Exiv2
or an application included in Exiv2 to load an image file with
specially crafted Exif tags, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Exiv2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/exiv2-0.13-r1"

==========
