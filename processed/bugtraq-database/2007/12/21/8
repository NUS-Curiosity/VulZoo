Title: [CAID 35970]: CA Products That Embed Ingres Authentication 
Vulnerability

CA Vuln ID (CAID): 35970

CA Advisory Date: 2007-12-19

Reported By: Ingres Corporation

Impact: Attacker can gain elevated privileges.

Summary: A potential vulnerability exists in the Ingres software 
that is embedded in various CA products. This vulnerability exists 
only on Ingres 2.5 and Ingres 2.6 on Windows, and does not 
manifest itself on any Unix platform. Ingres r3 and Ingres 2006 
are not affected.  The vulnerability, CVE-2007-6334, is associated 
with users who connect after the first user being assigned the 
privileges and identity of the first user. In all reported 
instances, the application (typically an ASP.NET application using 
the Ingres ODBC driver) was running on Microsoft IIS Web server, 
and with the Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) option 
enabled. While IWA is not enabled by default, it is a commonly 
used option. It should be noted that the Ingres .NET data provider 
is not affected.

Mitigating Factors: The vulnerability exists only on Windows 
systems running Microsoft IIS Web server that have the Integrated 
Windows Authentication (IWA) option enabled.

Severity: CA has given this vulnerability a High risk rating.

Affected Products:
All CA products that embed Ingres 2.5 and Ingres 2.6, and also run 
Microsoft IIS Web server with the Integrated Windows 
Authentication (IWA) option enabled.

Affected Platforms:
Windows

Status and Recommendation (URLs may wrap):
Ingres has issued the following patches to address the 
vulnerabilities.
Ingres 2.6 Single-Byte patch - Ingres 2.6 Single-Byte patch
ftp://ftp.ca.com/caproducts/ips/MDB/Generic_Ingres/IIS_Vulnerability/patch-2.6.0701.12467-win-x86.zip
Ingres 2.6 Double-Byte patch- Ingres 2.6 Double-Byte patch
ftp://ftp.ca.com/caproducts/ips/MDB/Generic_Ingres/IIS_Vulnerability/patch-2.6.0701.12473-win-x86-DBL.zip
Ingres 2.5 Single Byte Patch- Ingres 2.5 Single Byte patch
ftp://ftp.ca.com/caproducts/ips/MDB/Generic_Ingres/IIS_Vulnerability/patch-2.5.0605.12291-win-x86.zip
Potential problems installing the patches:
While testing these patches, CA identified an install issue when 
the user is presented with the option to make a backup of the 
Ingres installation. In cases where a <space> is in the path, the 
path is not properly read. The backup does get taken and is by 
default stored in the %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\install\backup directory. 
Additionally, if the user happens to press the "Set Directory" 
button, the path will be displayed. Clicking "ok" will result in a 
message stating "... spaces are not supported in paths... ". This 
also is an error; pressing cancel will return the user to the 
first screen with the default path, and while the displayed path 
is terminated at a space, the actual path does work. To avoid this 
issue, use DOS 8.3 definitions (ex. C:\progra~1\CA\ingres).

How to determine if you are affected:
Check the %II_SYSTEM%\ingres\version.rel file to identify the 
Ingres version. If the installed version of Ingres 2.6 is a 
Double-Byte version (should have DBL referenced), please download 
the 2.6 Double-Byte patch. Otherwise, use the Single-Byte patch.

Workaround: None
