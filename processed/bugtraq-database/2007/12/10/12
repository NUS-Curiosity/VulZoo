Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities were found in GNU Emacs possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GNU Emacs is a highly extensible and customizable text editor.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-editors/emacs      < 22.1-r3                       >= 22.1-r3
                                                          *>= 21.4-r14
                                                                  < 19

Description
===========

Drake Wilson reported that the hack-local-variables() function in GNU
Emacs 22 does not properly match assignments of local variables in a
file against a list of unsafe or risky variables, allowing to override
them (CVE-2007-5795). Andreas Schwab (SUSE) discovered a stack-based
buffer overflow in the format function when handling values with high
precision (CVE-2007-6109).

Impact
======

Remote attackers could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
in GNU Emacs, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary Emacs Lisp
code (via CVE-2007-5795) or arbitrary code (via CVE-2007-6109) with the
privileges of the user running GNU Emacs.

Workaround
==========

The first vulnerability can be worked around by setting the
"enable-local-variables" option to "nil", disabling the processing of
local variable lists. GNU Emacs prior to version 22 is not affected by
this vulnerability. There is no known workaround for the second
vulnerability at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GNU Emacs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-editors/emacs-22.1-r3"
