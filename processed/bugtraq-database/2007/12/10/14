Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Cairo, possibly leading
to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Cairo is a 2D vector graphics library with cross-device output support.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-libs/cairo      < 1.4.12                            >= 1.4.12

Description
===========

Multiple integer overflows were reported, one of which Peter Valchev
(Google Security) found to be leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
in the cairo_image_surface_create_from_png() function that processes
PNG images.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to view or process a specially
crafted PNG image file in an application linked against Cairo, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cairo users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-libs/cairo-1.4.12"

References
==========
