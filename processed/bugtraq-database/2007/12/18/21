Synopsis
========

Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in E2fsprogs could result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

E2fsprogs provides utilities for use with the ext2 and ext3 file
systems including the libext2fs library that allows user-level programs
to manipulate an ext2 or ext3 file system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-fs/e2fsprogs      < 1.40.3                          >= 1.40.3

Description
===========

Rafal Wojtczuk (McAfee AVERT Research) discovered multiple integer
overflows in libext2fs, that are triggered when processing information
from within the file system, resulting in heap-based buffer overflows.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to process a specially-crafted ext2 or
ext3 file system image (with tools linking against libext2fs, e.g.
fsck, forensic tools or Xen's pygrub), possibly resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All E2fsprogs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-fs/e2fsprogs-1.40.3"
