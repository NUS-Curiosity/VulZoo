   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2007-015
Advisory Title: Perforce P4Web Denial Of Service through resource 
                starvation
        Author: Oliver Karow / Oliver_Karow@...antec.com
  Release Date: 19 DEC 2007
   Application: Perforce 2006.1
      Platform: Win32
      Severity: Remotely exploitable - Denial Of Service
 Vendor status: Resolved
    CVE Number: CVE-2007-6349
     Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26806

Overview: 

- From wikipedia: "Perforce is a commercial Revision Control (RC) 
system. It is developed by Perforce Software, Inc. and was founded 
in 1995 by Christopher Seiwald. The Perforce system is based on a 
client/server model with the server managing the collection of 
source versions in one or more depots. The server software runs on 
the Unix, Mac OS X, or Microsoft Windows operating systems.

The client provides graphical and command line tools for a large 
number of operating systems. Also available is a suite of plugins 
that integrate with various programming IDEs and third party 
applications, such as XCode, Autodesk 3D Studio Max, Alias Maya, 
Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office, Eclipse and Emacs.

Other features of the system include support for reporting 
(i.e. notifying users when a file has changed), branching and 
merging, and defect tracking."

There is a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in the P4Web Daemon
which make it possible to enforce a full CPU usage of the system, by
sending a single, special crafted HTTP request.


Details: 

A single HTTP request with the Content-Length header variable set 
to a value greater than zero in a request which no body, will cause
the P4Webs.exe process to consume 99% of CPU time on the target 
system. of up to 99%.

The attack can be executed remotely. No authentication is required 
for exploitation.


Vendor Response:
    Perforce has confirmed an issue with Windows-based operating
    systems and P4Web versions 2006.2 and prior that can result
    in the P4Web host machine becoming unusable due to excessive
    CPU usage. This was discovered by our QA department in
    February of 2007, and addressed in our 2007.2 release.

Recommendation:
    Users concerned about this issue should upgrade to P4Web
    2007.2 or later, available at no charge from:
        ftp://ftp.perforce.com/perforce/r07.2/bin.ntx86/p4webinst.exe
