Synopsis
========

mgv improperly handles user-supplied data possibly allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

mgv is a Postscript viewer with a Motif interface, based on Ghostview
and GNU gv.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/mgv      <= 3.1.5                            Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

mgv includes code from gv that does not properly boundary check
user-supplied data before copying it into process buffers.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted Postscript
document with mgv and possibly execute arbitrary code with the rights
of the user running mgv.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

mgv is currently unmaintained, and the mgv website no longer exists. As
such, the mgv package has been masked in Portage. We recommend that
users select an alternate Postscript viewer such as ghostview or
GSview, and unmerge mgv:

    # emerge --unmerge "app-text/mgv"
