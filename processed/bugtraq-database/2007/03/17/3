Synopsis
========

The Apache Tomcat Connector (mod_jk) contains a buffer overflow
vulnerability that could result in the remote execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

The Apache HTTP server is a very widely used web server. mod_jk
provides the JK module for connecting Tomcat and Apache using the ajp13
protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /   Vulnerable   /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apache/mod_jk      < 1.2.21-r1                   >= 1.2.21-r1

Description
===========

ZDI reported an unsafe memory copy in mod_jk that was discovered by an
anonymous researcher in the map_uri_to_worker function of
native/common/jk_uri_worker_map.c .

Impact
======

A remote attacker can send a long URL request to an Apache server using
Tomcat. That can trigger the vulnerability and lead to a stack-based
buffer overflow, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code
with the permissions of the Apache user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Apache Tomcat users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apache/mod_jk-1.2.21-r1"
