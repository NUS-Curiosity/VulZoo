Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in SeaMonkey, some of which
may allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

Background
==========

The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver
production-quality releases of code derived from the application
formerly known as the 'Mozilla Application Suite'.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/seamonkey           < 1.1.1                   >= 1.1.1
  2  www-client/seamonkey-bin       < 1.1.1                   >= 1.1.1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Tom Ferris reported a heap-based buffer overflow involving wide SVG
stroke widths that affects SeaMonkey. Various researchers reported some
errors in the JavaScript engine potentially leading to memory
corruption. SeaMonkey also contains minor vulnerabilities involving
cache collision and unsafe pop-up restrictions, filtering or CSS
rendering under certain conditions. All those vulnerabilities are the
same as in GLSA 200703-04 affecting Mozilla Firefox.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page or
to read a specially crafted email that will trigger one of the
vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code.
It is also possible for an attacker to spoof the address bar, steal
information through cache collision, bypass the local file protection
mechanism with pop-ups, or perform cross-site scripting attacks,
leading to the exposure of sensitive information, such as user
credentials.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
most of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript. Note that the
execution of JavaScript is disabled by default in the SeaMonkey email
client, and enabling it is strongly discouraged.

Resolution
==========

Users upgrading to the following release of SeaMonkey should note that
the corresponding Mozilla Firefox upgrade has been found to lose the
saved passwords file in some cases. The saved passwords are encrypted
and stored in the 'signons.txt' file of ~/.mozilla/ and we advise our
users to save that file before performing the upgrade.

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.1"

All SeaMonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.1"
