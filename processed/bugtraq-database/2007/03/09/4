Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2007-0009

Package names:	   gnupg, php4
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2007-03-09
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0.5
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

Package description:
  gnupg
  GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because it does not
  use IDEA it can be used without any restrictions. GnuPG is in compliance
  with the OpenPGP specification (RFC2440).

  php4
  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. PHP attempts to make
  it easy for developers to write dynamically generated web pages.
  PHP also offers built-in database integration for several commercial
  and non-commercial database management systems, so writing a
  database-enabled web page with PHP is fairly simple. The most
  common use of PHP coding is probably as a replacement for CGI
  scripts. The mod_php module enables the Apache web server to
  understand and process the embedded PHP language in web pages.

Problem description:
  gnupg < TSL 3.0.5 >  < TSL 3.0 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: GnuPG 1.4.6 and earlier, when run from the command
    line, does not visually distinguish signed and unsigned portions
    of OpenPGP messages with multiple components, which might allow
    remote attackers to forge the contents of a message without
    detection.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2007-1263 to this issue.

  php4 < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - Fixes crash problem with the session extension when register_globals
    is turned on.
  - SECURITY Fix: Several vulnerabilities have been reported in PHP,
    which can be exploited by malicious people to disclose potentially
    sensitive information, cause a DoS and potentially compromise a
    vulnerable system. (SA24089)
