I'm not a Windows expert, but...  There have been some past
vulnerabilities where an attacker could upload a shortcut (.lnk) file
and access files outside of the intended directory.  In cases of FTP
servers or mail clients, this makes symlink style attacks remotely
feasible.  Some previously reported examples are
CVE-2004-2672/CVE-2005-0519/CVE-2005-0520 (argosoft), CVE-2005-2184
(eRoom), CVE-2005-0587 (Firefox), and CVE-2001-1386 (WFTPD).

So, issues *like* symlink vulnerabilities can happen on Windows - but
whether they're under-reported is unknown.  Hard links, too
(CVE-2002-0725 for NT and CVE-2003-0844 for mod_gzip).  Maybe there's
something about Windows API functions that make it more rare than in
the Unix world?
