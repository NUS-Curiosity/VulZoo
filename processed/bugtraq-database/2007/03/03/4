Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, some of
which may allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

Background
==========

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                         /  Vulnerable  /       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla-firefox          < 2.0.0.2        *>= 1.5.0.10
                                                            >= 2.0.0.2
  2  www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin      < 2.0.0.2        *>= 1.5.0.10
                                                            >= 2.0.0.2
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Tom Ferris reported a heap-based buffer overflow involving wide SVG
stroke widths that affects Mozilla Firefox 2 only. Various researchers
reported some errors in the JavaScript engine potentially leading to
memory corruption. Mozilla Firefox also contains minor vulnerabilities
involving cache collision and unsafe pop-up restrictions, filtering or
CSS rendering under certain conditions.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page
that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to
spoof the address bar, steal information through cache collision,
bypass the local files protection mechanism with pop-ups, or perform
cross-site scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of sensitive
information, like user credentials.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
most of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript.

Resolution
==========

Users upgrading to the following releases of Mozilla Firefox should
note that this upgrade has been found to lose the saved passwords file
in some cases. The saved passwords are encrypted and stored in the
'signons.txt' file of ~/.mozilla/ and we advise our users to save that
file before performing the upgrade.

All Mozilla Firefox 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.10"

All Mozilla Firefox 1.5 binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.10"

All Mozilla Firefox 2.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.2"

All Mozilla Firefox 2.0 binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.2"
