Synopsis
========

The Mozilla Network Security Services libraries are vulnerable to two
buffer overflows that could result in the remote execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

The Mozilla Network Security Service is a library implementing security
features like SSL v2/v3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12,
S/MIME and X.509 certificates.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/nss      < 3.11.5                              >= 3.11.5

Description
===========

iDefense has reported two potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities
found by researcher "regenrecht" in the code implementing the SSLv2
protocol.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted SSL master key to a
server using NSS for the SSLv2 protocol, or entice a user to connect to
a malicious server with a client-side application using NSS like one of
the Mozilla products. This could trigger the vulnerabilities and result
in the possible execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the
vulnerable application.

Workaround
==========

Disable the SSLv2 protocol in the applications using NSS.

Resolution
==========

All NSS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nss-3.11.5"
