Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in FreeType allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

FreeType is a True Type Font rendering library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/freetype     < 2.3.4-r2                    >= 2.3.4-r2
                                                                 < 2.0

Description
===========

Victor Stinner discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the function
Get_VMetrics() in src/truetype/ttgload.c when processing TTF files with
a negative n_points attribute.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TTF
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running FreeType.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FreeType users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/freetype-2.3.4-r2"
