Subject: Updated: webMethods Security Advisory: Glue console directory traversal vulnerability

========================================================================

                  webMethods Security Advisory 
            Glue console directory traversal vulnerability 
 
 
Announced: 2007-04-17
Revised:   2007-05-07
Affects:   webMethods Glue 4.x, 5.x, 6.x
Severity:  High
 

I. Description 
 
On April 11 2007, Patrick Webster reported a vulnerability in Glue
on this list.

The vulnerability allows a user to remotely read any file on the
server where the Glue server is running.  The full text of Patrick's
advisory is at http://www.aushack.com/advisories/200704-webmethods.txt.

This vulnerability has been assigned identifier CVE-2007-2048 in the 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures dictionary (http://cve.mitre.org).
 
 
II. Impact 
 
If an unauthorized attacker can connect to the vulnerable product, 
they can read any file on the target system by submitting a URL
such as  http://glueconsole:8080/console?resource=c:\boot.ini
or  http://glueconsole:8080/console?resource=/etc/passwd.  No 
authentication is required.
 
 
III. Workaround 
 
There are several optional workarounds:

(1) Disable the Glue console by editing the configuration files as 
follows.  This will prevent the attack, but limit the usability
of the system.

CAUTION: Changing these configuration files may render your system 
unreliable.  Back up all configuration files before making any changes. 

Make the following changes to the web.xml file found in glue/WEB-INF: 
 
* Remove the glue-console servlet definition 
   <servlet> 
      <servlet-name>glue-console</servlet-name> 
      <servlet-class>electric.console.ConsoleServlet</servlet-class> 
      ... 
   </servlet> 
 
* Remove the glue-console servlet mapping 
   <servlet-mapping> 
      <servlet-name>glue-console</servlet-name> 
      <url-pattern>/console/*</url-pattern> 
    </servlet-mapping> 


Make the following changes to the glue-config.xml file found in
glue/WEB-INF: 
 
* Change glue console enablement from "yes" to "no" 
     <console> 
     <!--enable the console by default?--> 
     <enabled>no</enabled> 
     ... 
 
(2) Block access to the /console URL by unauthorized users.  This 
blocking must be implemented using a third party product such as a 
firewall, and does not exist in webMethods products.  This workaround
does 
not prevent authorized users from reading any file on the system.

(3) If the Glue server is running on a UNIX system, run it within a
"chroot" environment to limit those files which can be read.

 
IV. Fix 

Fix Glue_5-0-2_Fix3 for Glue 5.0 is available for download from 
http://www.webmethods.com/dnld/Glue_5-0-2_Fix3.zip.  After
downloading, follow the instructions in the ZIP file to install the fix.
