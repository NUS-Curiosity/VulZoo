ZDI-07-025: Trend Micro ServerProtect AgRpcCln.dll Stack Overflow
            Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-07-025.html
May  7, 2007

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2007-2508

-- Affected Vendor:
Trend Micro

-- Affected Products:
ServerProtect v5.58

TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since May  2, 2007 by Digital Vaccine protection
filter ID 5125. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Trend Micro ServerProtect. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the SpntSvc.exe daemon, bound by default on
TCP port 5168 and exposing the following DCE/RPC interface through
TmRpcSrv.dll:

    /* opcode: 0x00, address: 0x65741030 */
    error_status_t sub_65741030 (
        [in] handle_t arg_1,
        [in] long arg_2,
        [in][size_is(arg_4)] byte arg_3[],
        [in] long arg_4,
        [out][size_is(arg_6)] byte arg_5[],
        [in] long arg_6
    );

A sub-function within this interface is vulnerable to a stack overflow
due an unbounded call to wcscpy() within the routine
CAgRpcClient::CreateBinding() defined in AgRpcCln.dll library.

-- Vendor Response:
Trend Micro has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
