Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in Tomcat that allows for the
disclosure of sensitive information.

Background
==========

Tomcat is the Apache Jakarta Project's official implementation of Java
Servlets and Java Server Pages.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/tomcat      < 5.5.22                        >= 5.5.22

Description
===========

Tomcat allows special characters like slash, backslash or URL-encoded
backslash as a separator, while Apache does not.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted URL to the vulnerable
Tomcat server, possibly resulting in a directory traversal and read
access to arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running
Tomcat. Note that this vulnerability can only be exploited when using
apache proxy modules like mod_proxy, mod_rewrite or mod_jk.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Tomcat users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/tomcat-5.5.22"

==========
