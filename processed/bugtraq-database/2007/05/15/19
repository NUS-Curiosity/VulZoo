    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1366

Description:
    Previous versions of the samba package are vulnerable to multiple attacks in
which remote attackers may be able to run arbitrary code as the root user on
samba servers. The default install of Foresight is not vulnerable - one must
manually configure samba for these vulnerabilities to be exposed.
