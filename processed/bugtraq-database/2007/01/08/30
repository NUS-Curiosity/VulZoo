    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-905

Description:
    Previous versions of the openoffice.org package are vulnerable to an
    arbitrary code execution attack.  When OpenOffice.org opens an
    intentionally-malformed .wmf or .emf file, it executes arbitrary code
    provided by the attacker.
