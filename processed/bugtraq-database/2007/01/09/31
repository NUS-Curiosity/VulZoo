Published: 2007-01-09
Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Major
Exposure Level Classification:
    Indirect User Information Exposure
Updated Versions:

    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-919

Description:
    Previous versions of the fetchmail package inappropriately send
    passwords in clear text rather than encrypted, allowing attackers
    to read the password from network traffic.  They also may not detect
    man-in-the-middle attacks.  Because email passwords are often the
    same as login passwords, this may indirectly enable remote
    unauthorized access.
