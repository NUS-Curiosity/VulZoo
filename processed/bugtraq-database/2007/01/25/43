This statement is inconsistent with Oracle's CPU, which states that
DB08 (CVE-2007-0274) has Partial impact on availability, and no impact
on Integrity and Confidentiality.

>Affected versions: Oracle Database Server versions 9iR1, 9iR2 and
>10gR1

DB08 reports 9iR2 as being the earliest affected version, which is
another discrepancy.
