Subject Name:            fetchmail
Subject Summary:         POP3/IMAP Batch Client
Subject Home:            http://fetchmail.berlios.de/
Subject Versions:        * <= 6.3.5

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2006-5867, CVE-2006-5974
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           denial of service, exposure of sensitive
                         information

Description:
    According to vendor release notes [0] and security advisories
    [1][2], two security issues exist in the POP3/IMAP batch client
    Fetchmail [3], version up to and including 6.3.5. First, several
    password disclosure vulnerabilities exist because Fetchmail is using
    unsafe logins or omitting the necessary protection through SSL/TLS.
    Second, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists because
    Fetchmail crashes during dereferencing the NULL page, when rejecting
    a message sent to an MDA.
