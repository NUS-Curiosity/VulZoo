KDE Security Advisory: kpdf/kword/xpdf denial of service vulnerability
Original Release Date: 2007-01-15
URL: http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20070115-1.txt

0. References
        CVE-2007-0104


1. Systems affected:

        KDE 3.2.0 up to including KDE 3.5.5. KDE 3.5.6 and newer is
        not affected. KOffice 1.2 and newer contain the same code.


2. Overview:

        kpdf, the KDE pdf viewer, shares code with xpdf. xpdf contains
        a vulnerability that can cause denial of service (infinite loop)
        via a PDF file that contains a crafted catalog dictionary
        or a crafted Pages attribute that references an invalid page
        tree node.


3. Impact:

        Remotely supplied pdf files can be used to disrupt the kpdf
        viewer on the client machine.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.
