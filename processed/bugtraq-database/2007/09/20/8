Problems addressed by these patches:

I    Arbitrary code execution and denial of service vulnerabilities

     This release fixes a security vulnerability that could allow a
     guest operating system user with administrative privileges to cause
     memory corruption in a host process, and thus potentially execute
     arbitrary code on the host. (CVE-2007-4496)

     This release fixes a denial of service vulnerability that could
     allow a guest operating system to cause a host process to become
     unresponsive or exit unexpectedly. (CVE-2007-4497)

     Thanks to Rafal Wojtczvk of McAfee for identifying and reporting
     these issues.

VI   ESX Service Console updates

a.   Service console package Samba, has been updated to address the
     following issues:

     Various bugs were found in NDR parsing, used to decode MS-RPC
     requests in Samba. A remote attacker could have sent carefully
     crafted requests causing a heap overflow, which may have led to the
     ability to execute arbitrary code on the server. (CVE-2007-2446)

     Unescaped user input parameters were being passed as arguments to
     /bin/sh. A remote, authenticated, user could have triggered this
     flaw and executed arbitrary code on the server. Additionally, this
     flaw could be triggered by a remote unauthenticated user if Samba
     was configured to use the non-default username map script option.
     (CVE-2007-2447)

     Thanks to the Samba developers, TippingPoint, and iDefense for
     identifying and reporting these issues.

     Note: These issues only affect the service console network, and are
     not remote vulnerabilities for ESX Server hosts that have been set
     up with the security best practices provided by VMware.

b.   Updated bind package for the service console fixes a flaw with the
     way ISC BIND processed certain DNS query responses.

     ISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of
     the DNS (Domain Name System) protocols. Under some circumstances, a
     malicious remote user could launch a Denial-of-Service attack on
     ESX Server hosts that had enabled DNSSEC validation.
     (CVE-2007-0494)

     Note: These issues only affect the service console network, and are
     not remote vulnerabilities for ESX Server hosts that have been set
     up with the security best practices provided by VMware.

c.   This patch provides updated service console package krb5 update.

     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
     assigned the names CVE-2007-2442, CVE-2007-2443, and CVE-2007-2798

d.   Service console update for vixie-cron

     This patch provides an updated service console package vixie-cron.
     Cron is a standard UNIX daemon that runs specified programs at
     scheduled times.

     A denial of service issue was found in the way vixie-cron verified
     crontab file integrity. A local user with the ability to create a
     hardlink to /etc/crontab could potentially prevent vixie-cron from
     executing certain system cron jobs. (CVE-2007-1856)

     This patch provides an updated PAM package A vulnerability was
     found that could allow console users with access to certain device
     files to cause damage to recordable CD drives. Certain file
     permissions have now been modified to disallow access.
     (CVE-2004-0813)

     A flaw was found with console device permissions. It was possible
     for various console devices to retain ownership of the previoius
     console user after logging out, which could result in leakage of
     information to an unauthorized user. (CVE-2007-1716)

     Compiler Collection (GCC) packages that include C, C++, Java,
     Fortran 77, Objective C, and Ada 95 GNU compilers and related
     support libraries.

     A flaw was found in the fastjar utility that could potentially
