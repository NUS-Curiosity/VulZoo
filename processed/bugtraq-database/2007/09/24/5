Synopsis
========

BEA JRockit contains several vulnerabilities, some of which may allow
the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

BEA JRockit provides tools, utilities, and a complete runtime
environment for developing and running applications using the Java
programming language.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /    Vulnerable    /         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin      < 1.5.0.11_p1        >= 1.5.0.11_p1

Description
===========

An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the embedded ICC profile
image parser (CVE-2007-2788), an unspecified vulnerability exists in
the font parsing implementation (CVE-2007-4381), and an error exists
when processing XSLT stylesheets contained in XSLT Transforms in XML
signatures (CVE-2007-3716), among other vulnerabilities.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could trigger the integer overflow to execute
arbitrary code or crash the JVM through a specially crafted file. Also,
an attacker could perform unauthorized actions via an applet that
grants certain privileges to itself because of the font parsing
vulnerability. The error when processing XSLT stylesheets can be
exploited to execute arbitrary code. Other vulnerabilities could lead
to establishing restricted network connections to certain services,
Cross Site Scripting and Denial of Service attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time for all these
vulnerabilities.

Resolution
==========

All BEA JRockit users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-java/jrockit-jdk-bin-1.5.0.11_p1"
