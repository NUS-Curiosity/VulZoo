Synopsis
========

GDM can be crashed by a local user, preventing it from managing future
displays.

Background
==========

GDM is the GNOME display manager.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  gnome-base/gdm      < 2.18.4                            >= 2.18.4
                                                            *>= 2.16.7

Description
===========

The result of a g_strsplit() call is incorrectly parsed in the files
daemon/gdm.c, daemon/gdmconfig.c, gui/gdmconfig.c and
gui/gdmflexiserver.c, allowing for a null pointer dereference.

Impact
======

A local user could send a crafted message to /tmp/.gdm_socket that
would trigger the null pointer dereference and crash GDM, thus
preventing it from managing future displays.

Workaround
==========

Restrict the write permissions on /tmp/.gdm_socket to trusted users
only after each GDM restart.

Resolution
==========

All GDM users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "gnome-base/gdm"
