Synopsis
========

RealPlayer is vulnerable to a buffer overflow allowing for execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

RealPlayer is a multimedia player capable of handling multiple
multimedia file formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/realplayer      < 10.0.9                    >= 10.0.9

Description
===========

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in the
SmilTimeValue::parseWallClockValue() function in smlprstime.cpp when
handling HH:mm:ss.f type time formats.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to open a specially crafted SMIL (Synchronized
Multimedia Integration Language) file, an attacker could be able to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All RealPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/realplayer-10.0.9"
