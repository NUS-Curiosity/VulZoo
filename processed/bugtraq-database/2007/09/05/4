Description:
    Previous versions of the gd, php, and php5 packages are vulnerable
    to multiple attacks in which an attacker may cause unbounded CPU
    consumption or application crashes (Denial of Service), possibly
    leading to the execution of malicious code (Unauthorized Access).
    These attacks are generally limited to uses of the gd library to load
    existing images rather than generate new images.  Many applications
    that use gd (including all uses of gd within rPath Linux) us gd
    only for generating new images, not for loading existing images.
    
    While rPath Linux itself is not vulnerable to these attacks,
    some uses of gd, particularly when loading attacker-supplied
    images, will be vulnerable.  Some applications which use gd
    to load images supplied by remote users are web applications
    written in PHP.
