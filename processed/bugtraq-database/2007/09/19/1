    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1462

Description:
    Previous versions of the kdebase package contain an Information Exposure
    vulnerability in which the Konqueror web browser may incorrectly "leak"
    keystroke information through to an Adobe Flash Player plugin.
    
    rPath Linux 1 does not include the Adobe Flash Player plugin, so rPath
    Linux 1 has limited exposure to this vulnerability.
