(Bcc'ing all people mentioned by name.  Note that Bugtraq is moderated.)

JFTR, a clarification to get the credits right:

Isaac Wilcox was perhaps not the first to actually discover this, but he
was the first person to report this to one of the upstream maintainers,
namely Rob Funk.

Isaac Wilcox has also invested a considerable amount of time setting up
a test suite so we could actually find more cases where passwords leaked
than originally thought. This deserves public credit.

Charles Levert had discovered this issue earlier and fixed it with
additional require-TLS patches which he kept on the gna.org website,
unbeknownst to the fetchmail maintainers.
