    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1034

Description:
    The previous security update for CVE-2006-5456; a buffer overflow parsing
    Palm Pixmap files, was not sufficient.  Previous versions of the
    ImageMagick package are vulnerable to Denial of Service and possibly
    Unauthorized Access when presented with an intentionally malformed
    Palm Pixmap file.  The main form of remote exposure is when ImageMagick
    is exposed to remote users via web services.
