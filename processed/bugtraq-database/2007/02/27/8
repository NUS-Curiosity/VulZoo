    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1088

Description:
    Previous versions of the php package are vulnerable to multiple
    vulnerabilities of varying severity.  The most severe of these
    vulnerabilities are expected to enable remote code execution as the
    "apache" user via php applications that call certain functions such as
    str_replace(), imap_mail_compose(), or odbc_result_all() functions.
