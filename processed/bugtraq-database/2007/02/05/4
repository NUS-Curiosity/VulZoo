Subject: Sql injection bugs in Xoops 2.0.16 + Weblinks module

Hi,

These bugs were published in full-disclosure about 2 weeks ago (CVE-2007-0377).

There is a sql injection bug in Xoops 2.0.16 core (and maybe other versions) in
admin section:

The 'id' parameter in "get()" function is not checked against sql injections :

File kernel/group.php, Line 94 :
::     function &get($id)
::     {
::         $group = false;
::     	if (intval($id) > 0) {
**             $sql = 'SELECT * FROM '.$this->db->prefix('groups').' WHERE groupid='.$id;

This one doesnt seem to be critical .


In "Weblinks" module :

The 'lid' parameter in "deleteByLid()" function is not
checked against sql injections :

File class/table_broken.php, Line 58 :
:: function deleteByLid($lid)
:: {
** 	$sql = "DELETE FROM $this->table WHERE lid=$lid";
:: 	return  $this->query_false($sql);
:: }

Also 3 other sql injections exist which can be exploitable and are not
discribed here . The new version is not released yet .
