Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the network components of
UFO2000 that could result in the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

UFO2000 is a multi-player, turn-based tactical simulation.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-strategy/ufo2000     < 0.7.1062                 >= 0.7.1062

Description
===========

Five vulnerabilities were found: a buffer overflow in recv_add_unit();
a problem with improperly trusting user-supplied string information in
decode_stringmap(); several issues with array manipulation via various
commands during play; an SQL injection in server_protocol.cpp; and
finally, a second buffer overflow in recv_map_data().

Impact
======

An attacker could send crafted network traffic as part of a
multi-player game that could result in remote code execution on the
remote opponent or the server. A remote attacker could also run
arbitrary SQL queries against the server account database, and perform
a Denial of Service on a remote opponent by causing the game to crash.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

UFO2000 currently depends on the dumb-0.9.2 library, which has been
removed from portage due to security problems (GLSA 200608-14) .
Because of this, UFO2000 has been masked, and we recommend unmerging
the package until the next beta release can remove the dependency on
dumb.

    # emerge --ask --verbose --unmerge ufo2000
