Synopsis
========

ISC BIND contains two vulnerabilities allowing a Denial of Service
under certain conditions.

Background
==========

ISC BIND is the Internet Systems Consortium implementation of the
Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/bind       < 9.3.4                               >= 9.3.4
                                                             *>= 9.2.8

Description
===========

An unspecified improper usage of an already freed context has been
reported. Additionally, an assertion error could be triggered in the
DNSSEC validation of some responses to type ANY queries with multiple
RRsets.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could crash the server through unspecified vectors
or, if DNSSEC validation is enabled, by sending certain crafted ANY
queries.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time for the first issue. The
DNSSEC validation Denial of Service can be prevented by disabling
DNSSEC validation until the upgrade to a fixed version. Note that
DNSSEC validation is disabled on a default configuration.

Resolution
==========

All ISC BIND 9.3 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.3.4"

All ISC BIND 9.2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/bind-9.2.8"
