NSFOCUS Security Advisory (SA2007-01)

Microsoft IE5 CSS Parsing Memory Corruption Vulnerability

Release Date: 2007-08-15

CVE ID: CVE-2007-0943

http://www.nsfocus.com/english/homepage/research/0701.htm

Affected systems & software
===================

Internet Explorer 5.01


Unaffected systems & software
===================


Summary
=========

NSFocus Security Team discovered a memory corruption vulnerability in IE 5 
that allows arbitrary code execution when parsing a malicious CSS file.

Description
============

There exists a vulnerability when IE 5.0 parses CSS due to insufficient check 
on the pointer. Out-of-bound pointer reference and memory overwriting might 
occur in the handling of malformed CSS files, which allows attackers to run 
arbitrary code via carefully crafted  data. 

Attackers can run arbitrary code by crafting a malicious WEB page and alluring 
users to visit it. If the victim is an administrator, then attackers can gain 
complete control over the system. 

The system will be vulnerable even if the security level of IE is set to "High". 

Workaround
=============

Do not visit untrusted websites.
