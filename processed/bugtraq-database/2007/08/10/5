Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GD, allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GD is a graphic library for fast image creation.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/gd      < 2.0.35                             >= 2.0.35

Description
===========

Xavier Roche discovered an infinite loop in the gdPngReadData()
function when processing a truncated PNG file (CVE-2007-2756). An
integer overflow has been discovered in the gdImageCreateTrueColor()
function (CVE-2007-3472). An error has been discovered in the function
gdImageCreateXbm() function (CVE-2007-3473). Unspecified
vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GIF reader (CVE-2007-3474).
An error has been discovered when processing a GIF image that has no
global color map (CVE-2007-3475). An array index error has been
discovered in the file gd_gif_in.c when processing images with an
invalid color index (CVE-2007-3476). An error has been discovered in
the imagearc() and imagefilledarc() functions when processing overly
large angle values (CVE-2007-3477). A race condition has been
discovered in the gdImageStringFTEx() function (CVE-2007-3478).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit one of these vulnerabilities to cause a
Denial of Service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running GD.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GD users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/gd-2.0.35"
