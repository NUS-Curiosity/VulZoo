 Integer Overflow Vulnerability

Trend Micro ServerProtect RPCFN_SYNC_TASK Integer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 08.21.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 21, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Trend Micro Inc.'s ServerProtect is an anti-virus software for Microsoft
Windows and Novell NetWare servers. It enables network administrators to
manage multiple deployments from a single management console. For more
information, please visit vendor's website at the following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in Trend Micro
Inc.'s ServerProtect anti-virus software could allow attackers to
execute arbitrary code with system level privilege.

The Trend ServerProtect service (SpntSvc.exe) handles RPC requests on
TCP port 5168 with interface uuid 25288888-bd5b-11d1-9d53-0080c83a5c2c.
This service utilizes the StRpcSrv.dll library to service various RPC
requests.

An integer overflow exists wtihin the RPCFN_SYNC_TASK function. This
function allocates memory based on a user-supplied integer within the
request data. By specifying a value that causes an integer overflow
during arithmetic calculations, an attacker can cause too little memory
to be allocated. User-supplied data is then copied into the resulting
buffer using lstrcpyW. This results in an exploitable heap buffer
overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with system
level privilege.

Exploitation requires that attackers send specially crafted RPC requests
to the Trend ServerProtect or Trend ServerProtect Agent services.
