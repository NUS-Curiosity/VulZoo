Published: 2007-08-23
Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Major
Exposure Level Classification:
    Local User Deterministic Unauthorized Access
Updated Versions:

References:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2797
    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1396

Description:
    Previous versions of the xterm package assigned incorrect ownership and
    write permissions to pseudo-terminal devices, permitting local users to
    direct output to other users' xterm sessions.
    
    Due to xterm's extensive internal processing of escape sequences, this
    also permits unauthorized modification of xterm session behavior.
