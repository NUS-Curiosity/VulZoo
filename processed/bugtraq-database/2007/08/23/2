Synopsis
========

Opera contain several vulnerabilities, some of which may allow the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Opera is a multi-platform web browser.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/opera       < 9.23                             >= 9.23

Description
===========

An error known as "a virtual function call on an invalid pointer" has
been discovered in the JavaScript engine (CVE-2007-4367). Furthermore,
iDefense Labs reported that an already-freed pointer may be still used
under unspecified circumstances in the BitTorrent support
(CVE-2007-3929). At last, minor other errors have been discovered,
relative to memory read protection (Opera Advisory 861) and URI
displays (CVE-2007-3142, CVE-2007-3819).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could trigger the BitTorrent vulnerability by
enticing a user into starting a malicious BitTorrent download, and
execute arbitrary code through unspecified vectors. Additionally, a
specially crafted JavaScript may trigger the "virtual function"
vulnerability. The JavaScript engine can also access previously freed
but uncleaned memory. Finally, a user can be fooled with a too long
HTTP server name that does not fit the dialog box, or a URI containing
whitespaces.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time for all these
vulnerabilities.

Resolution
==========

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.23"
