Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark, allowing
for the remote execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer with a graphical front-end.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/wireshark      < 0.99.6                    >= 0.99.6

Description
===========

Wireshark doesn't properly handle chunked encoding in HTTP responses
(CVE-2007-3389), iSeries capture files (CVE-2007-3390), certain types
of DCP ETSI packets (CVE-2007-3391), and SSL or MMS packets
(CVE-2007-3392). An off-by-one error has been discovered in the
DHCP/BOOTP dissector when handling DHCP-over-DOCSIS packets
(CVE-2007-3393).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets on a network
being monitored with Wireshark, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Wireshark which
might be the root user, or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

In order to prevent root compromise, take network captures with tcpdump
and analyze them running Wireshark as a least privileged user.

Resolution
==========

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.6"
