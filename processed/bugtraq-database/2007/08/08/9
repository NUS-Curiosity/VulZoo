Synopsis
========

Several array indexing vulnerabilities were discovered in Xvid,
possibly allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Xvid is a popular open source video codec licensed under the GPL.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xvid       < 1.1.3                            >= 1.1.3

Description
===========

Trixter Jack discovered an array indexing error in the
get_intra_block() function in the file src/bitstream/mbcoding.c. The
get_inter_block_h263() and get_inter_block_mpeg() functions in the same
file were also reported as vulnerable.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary
code by tricking a user or automated system into processing a malicious
video file with an application that makes use of the Xvid library.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Xvid users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xvid-1.1.3"
