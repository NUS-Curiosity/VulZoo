====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in the IMail Client,
which potentially can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the IMail
Client when processing emails containing multipart MIME data. This can
be exploited to cause a data segment-based buffer overflow via an
overly long "boundary" parameter (more than 212 bytes).

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

The vendor recommends users to delete the IMail Client application,
which will be removed from the next major release of the IPSwitch 
IMail Server.
