Synopsis
========

Three vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X Font Server
possibly allowing local attackers to gain elevated privileges.

Background
==========

The X.Org X11 X Font Server provides a standard mechanism for an X
server to communicate with a font renderer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-apps/xfs       < 1.0.5                               >= 1.0.5

Description
===========

iDefense reported that the xfs init script does not correctly handle a
race condition when setting permissions of a temporary file
(CVE-2007-3103). Sean Larsson discovered an integer overflow
vulnerability in the build_range() function possibly leading to a
heap-based buffer overflow when handling "QueryXBitmaps" and
"QueryXExtents" protocol requests (CVE-2007-4568). Sean Larsson also
discovered an error in the swap_char2b() function possibly leading to a
heap corruption when handling the same protocol requests
(CVE-2007-4990).

Impact
======

The first issue would allow a local attacker to change permissions of
arbitrary files to be world-writable by performing a symlink attack.
The second and third issues would allow a local attacker to execute
arbitrary code with privileges of the user running the X Font Server,
usually xfs.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All X Font Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-apps/xfs-1.0.5"
