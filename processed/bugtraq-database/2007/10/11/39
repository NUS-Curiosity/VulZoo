Impact: A remote attacker can cause a denial of service, execute 
arbitrary code, or take privileged action.

Summary: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in BrightStor ARCserve 
Backup that can allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of 
service, execute arbitrary code, or take privileged action. The 
first set of vulnerabilities, CVE-2007-5325, CVE-2007-5326, and 
CVE-2007-5327, occur due to insufficient bounds checking by 
multiple components. The second vulnerability, CVE-2007-5328, 
occurs due to privileged functions being available for use without 
proper authorization. The third set of vulnerabilities, 
CVE-2007-5329, CVE-2007-5330, CVE-2007-5331, and CVE-2007-5332, 
are due to a memory corruption occurring with the processing of 
RPC procedure arguments by multiple services. The vulnerabilities 
allow an attacker to cause a denial of service, or potentially to 
execute arbitrary code.
