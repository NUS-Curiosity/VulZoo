Synopsis
========

A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in
OpenOffice.org, allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                    /  Vulnerable  /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/openoffice           < 2.3.0                  >= 2.3.0
  2  app-office/openoffice-bin       < 2.3.0                  >= 2.3.0
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

iDefense Labs reported that the TIFF parsing code uses untrusted values
to calculate buffer sizes, which can lead to an integer overflow
resulting in heap-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.3.0"

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-2.3.0"
