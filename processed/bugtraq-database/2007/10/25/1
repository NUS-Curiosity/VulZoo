Synopsis
========

The hpssd daemon might allow local attackers to execute arbitrary
commands with root privileges.

Background
==========

The Hewlett-Packard Linux Imaging and Printing system (HPLIP) provides
drivers for HP's inkjet and laser printers, scanners and fax machines.
It integrates with the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) and Scanner
Access Now Easy (SANE).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-print/hplip     < 2.7.9-r1                      *>= 1.7.4a-r2
                                                           >= 2.7.9-r1

Description
===========

Kees Cook from the Ubuntu Security team discovered that the hpssd
daemon does not correctly validate user supplied data before passing it
to a "popen3()" call.

Impact
======

A local attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by sending a
specially crafted request to the hpssd daemon to execute arbitrary
commands with the privileges of the user running hpssd, usually root.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All HPLIP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "net-print/hplip"
