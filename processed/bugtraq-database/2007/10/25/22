Synopsis
========

A format string error has been discovered in Sylpheed and Claws Mail,
potentially leading to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Sylpheed and Claws Mail are two GTK based e-mail clients.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-client/sylpheed         < 2.4.5                     >= 2.4.5
  2  mail-client/claws-mail       < 3.0.0                     >= 3.0.0
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Ulf Harnhammar from Secunia Research discovered a format string error
in the inc_put_error() function in file src/inc.c.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious POP
server sending specially crafted replies, possibly resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Sylpheed users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/sylpheed-2.4.5"

All Claws Mail users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/claws-mail-3.0.0"
