Synopsis
========

Tikiwiki contains a command injection vulnerability which may allow
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

TikiWiki is an open source content management system written in PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/tikiwiki      < 1.9.8.1                       >= 1.9.8.1

Description
===========

ShAnKaR reported that input passed to the "f" array parameter in
tiki-graph_formula.php is not properly verified before being used to
execute PHP functions.

Impact
======

An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user
running the web server by passing a specially crafted parameter string
to the tiki-graph_formula.php file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All TikiWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/tikiwiki-1.9.8.1"
