Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.31.07: Symantec Altiris Deployment
 Solution TFTP/MTFTP Service Directory Traversal Vulnerability

Symantec Altiris Deployment Solution TFTP/MTFTP Service Directory
Traversal Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.31.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 31, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Symantec Altiris Deployment Solution is an automated OS deployment
solution that is used for deploying and managing servers, desktops, and
notebooks from a central location. More information is available on the
vendor's site at the following URL.

http://www.altiris.com/Products/DeploymentSolution.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a directory traversal vulnerability in Symantec's
Altiris Deployment Solution products could allow attackers to gain read
access to arbitrary files hosted on the Altiris server.

Altiris Deployment Solution includes a tftp/mtftp server within its
optional PXE server component which suffers from a directory traversal
condition. The server runs with SYSTEM level privileges and allows
unauthenticated attackers to download any file on the system.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to read arbitrary files from the server
machine. The tftp/mftp daemon runs with SYSTEM level privileges, so any
file readable by SYSTEM with a known file path can be downloaded without
authentication.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Altiris
Deployment Solution for Windows version 6.8. The specific vulnerable
executable is pxemtftp.exe version 6.8.8297.48.

V. WORKAROUND

If the PXE server component is not required in your environment it
should be disabled.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
