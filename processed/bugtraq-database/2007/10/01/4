Synopsis
========

Bugzilla contains several vulnerabilities, some of them possibly
leading to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Bugzilla is a web application designed to help with managing software
development.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/bugzilla       < 3.0.1                        *>= 2.20.5
                                                            *>= 2.22.3
                                                              >= 3.0.1

Description
===========

Masahiro Yamada found that from the 2.17.1 version, Bugzilla does not
properly sanitize the content of the "buildid" parameter when filing
bugs (CVE-2007-4543). The next two vulnerabilities only affect Bugzilla
2.23.3 or later, hence the stable Gentoo Portage tree does not contain
these two vulnerabilities: Loic Minier reported that the
"Email::Send::Sendmail()" function does not properly sanitise "from"
email information before sending it to the "-f" parameter of
/usr/sbin/sendmail (CVE-2007-4538), and Frédéric Buclin discovered
that the XML-RPC interface does not correctly check permissions in the
time-tracking fields (CVE-2007-4539).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could trigger the "buildid" vulnerability by sending
a specially crafted form to Bugzilla, leading to a persistent XSS, thus
allowing for theft of credentials. With Bugzilla 2.23.3 or later, an
attacker could also execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the
web server by injecting a specially crafted "from" email address and
gain access to normally restricted time-tracking information through
the XML-RPC service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Bugzilla users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose www-apps/bugzilla
