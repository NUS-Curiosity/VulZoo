Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in QGit allowing local users to
overwrite arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code with another
user's rights.

Background
==========

QGit is a graphical interface to git repositories that allows you to
browse revisions history, view patch content and changed files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-util/qgit       < 1.5.7                              >= 1.5.7

Description
===========

Raphael Marichez discovered that the DataLoader::doStart() method
creates temporary files in an insecure manner and executes them.

Impact
======

A local attacker could perform a symlink attack, possibly overwriting
files or executing arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
QGit.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All QGit users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/qgit-1.5.7"
