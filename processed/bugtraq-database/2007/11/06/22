Synopsis
========

Multiple issues have been identified in SiteBar that might allow
execution of arbitrary code and arbitrary file disclosure.

Background
==========

SiteBar is a PHP application that allows users to store their bookmarks
on a web server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/sitebar       < 3.3.9                           >= 3.3.9

Description
===========

Tim Brown discovered these multiple issues: the translation module does
not properly sanitize the value to the "dir" parameter (CVE-2007-5491,
CVE-2007-5694); the translation module also does not sanitize the
values of the "edit" and "value" parameters which it passes to eval()
and include() (CVE-2007-5492, CVE-2007-5693); the log-in command does
not validate the URL to redirect users to after logging in
(CVE-2007-5695); SiteBar also contains several cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-5692).

Impact
======

An authenticated attacker in the "Translators" or "Admins" group could
execute arbitrary code, read arbitrary files and possibly change their
permissions with the privileges of the user running the web server by
passing a specially crafted parameter string to the "translator.php"
file. An unauthenticated attacker could entice a user to browse a
specially crafted URL, allowing for the execution of script code in the
context of the user's browser, for the theft of browser credentials or
for a redirection to an arbitrary web site after login.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SiteBar users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/sitebar-3.3.9"
