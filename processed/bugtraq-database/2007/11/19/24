Description:
    Previous versions of the php5 package contain multiple vulnerabilities,
    the most serious of which involve several Denial of Service attacks
    (application crashes and temporary application hangs).  It is not
    currently known that these vulnerabilities can be exploited to execute
    malicious code.
    
    In its default configuration, rPath Linux 1 does not install php5 and
    is thus not vulnerable; however, systems upon which php5 and an exposed
    application have been installed may be vulnerable.
