Errata
======

The fixed ebuild proposed in the original version of this Security
Advisory did not address all the vulnerabilities of the Pioneers package.
All users of the Pioneers package should upgrade to
games-board/pioneers-0.11.3-r1.

The corrected sections appear below.

Synopsis
========

Two Denial of Service vulnerabilities were discovered in Pioneers.


Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /   Vulnerable   /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-board/pioneers      < 0.11.3-r1                >= 0.11.3-r1

Description
===========

Roland Clobus discovered that the Pioneers server may free sessions
objects while they are still in use, resulting in access to invalid
memory zones (CVE-2007-5933). Bas Wijnen discovered an error when
closing connections which can lead to a failed assertion
(CVE-2007-6010).

Resolution
==========

All Pioneers users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=games-board/pioneers-0.11.3-r1"
