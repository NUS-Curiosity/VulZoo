Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package have several vulnerabilities
    resolved in this release.  The most severe is a remotely triggerable
    denial of service via carefully crafted TCP ACK packets. The other
    vulnerabilities are denials of service that require local system
    access; one applies only when mounting minix filesystems, the other
    applies to certain process-exit conditions.
    
    A system reboot is required to resolve these vulnerabilities.
