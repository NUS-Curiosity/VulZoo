Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 11.07.07: Oracle 10g R2 PITRIG_DROPMETADATA
 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 11.07.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Nov 07, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Oracle Database Server is a family of database products that range from
personal databases to enterprise solutions. Further information is
available at the following URL.

http://www.oracle.com/database/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow in the
XDB.XDB_PITRIG_PKG.PITRIG_DROPMETADATA procedure in Oracle Corp.'s
Database 10gR2 could allow a user with an authenticated session to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the database account.

The XDB_PITRIG_PKG.PITRIG_DROPMETADATA procedure takes two arguments,
OWNER and NAME. The lengths of these arguments are used by an internal
function to construct an SQL query without being adequately sanitized.
If the combined length of the two fields is too large, a buffer
overflow occurs, allowing arbitrary code execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an authenticated remote user
to execute code on the underlying system in the context of the database
account. Other than access to execute the vulnerable function, this
vulnerability does not require any special privileges. From the
database user account, an attacker can then access or modify the
database and files related to its operation.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability on Oracle Database 10g Release
2 with all Critical Patch Updates as of February 2007. Previous versions
are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is not aware of any effective workaround for this
vulnerability.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

VII. CVE INFORMATION
