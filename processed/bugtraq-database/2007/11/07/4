====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerabilities

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Xpdf, which can
be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's system.

1) An array indexing error within the
"DCTStream::readProgressiveDataUnit()" method in xpdf/Stream.cc can be
exploited to corrupt memory via a specially crafted PDF file.

2) An integer overflow error within the "DCTStream::reset()" method in
xpdf/Stream.cc can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow
via a specially crafted PDF file.

3) A boundary error within the "CCITTFaxStream::lookChar()" method in
xpdf/Stream.cc can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow
by tricking a user into opening a PDF file containing a specially
crafted "CCITTFaxDecode" filter.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Do not open untrusted PDF files.

The vendor is reportedly working on a patch.
