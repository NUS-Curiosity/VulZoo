Synopsis
========

Mono's BigInteger implementation contains a buffer overflow
vulnerability that might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Mono provides the necessary software to develop and run .NET client and
server applications on various platforms.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/mono     < 1.2.5.1-r1                      >= 1.2.5.1-r1

Description
===========

IOActive discovered an error in the Mono.Math.BigInteger class, in the
reduction step of the Montgomery-based Pow methods, that could lead to
a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially
crafted data to Mono applications using the BigInteger class, which
might lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running the application (possibly root) or a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mono users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/mono-1.2.5.1-r1"

References
==========
