-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems with vulnerable installations of the RealNetworks RealPlayer.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists in RealPlayer's parsing of SWF files. The SWF
rendering DLL RealPlayer uses fails to properly handle malformed record
headers leading to an exploitable overflow. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability using an ActiveX control
{CFCDAA03-8BE4-11cf-B84B-0020AFBBCCFA} and embedding the malicious swf
file in the page or by convincing an affected user to directly open a
SWF file using RealPlayer.

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
