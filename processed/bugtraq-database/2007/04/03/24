-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Yahoo Messenger. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page.

    DLL:   yacscom.dll
    CLSID: 85A4A99C-8C3D-499E-A386-E0743DFF8FB7

properties, and the createAndJoinConference() method is called, a stack
overflow occurs. Exploitation can result in code execution under the
context of the current user.
