Synopsis
========

The Network Audio System is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could
result in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

Background
==========

NAS is a network transparent, client/server audio transport system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/nas       < 1.8b                               >= 1.8b

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in NAS, some of
which include a buffer overflow in the function accept_att_local(), an
integer overflow in the function ProcAuWriteElement(), and a null
pointer error in the function ReadRequestFromClient().

Impact
======

An attacker having access to the NAS daemon could send an overly long
slave name to the server, leading to the execution of arbitrary code
with root privileges. A remote attacker could also send a specially
crafted packet containing an invalid client ID, which would crash the
server and result in a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All NAS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/nas-1.8b"
