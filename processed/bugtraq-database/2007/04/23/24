Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in Blender allowing for
user-assisted arbitrary code execution.

Background
==========

Blender is a 3D creation, animation and publishing program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/blender       < 2.43                            >= 2.43

Description
===========

Stefan Cornelius of Secunia Research discovered an insecure use of the
"eval()" function in kmz_ImportWithMesh.py.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
Blender file (.kmz or .kml), resulting in the execution of arbitrary
Python code with the privileges of the user running Blender.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Blender users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/blender-2.43"
