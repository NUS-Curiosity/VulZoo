    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1218

Description:
    Previous versions of the lighttpd package are vulnerable to two denial
    of service attacks.  One is a remote denial of service that can cause
    lighttpd to consume all available CPU time and stop serving requests,
    and the other is a denial of service attack which generally requires
    a local user to create a file with an mtime of 0; the lighttpd daemon
    will crash when attempting to serve that file.  This crash does not
    enable any arbitrary or directed code execution.
