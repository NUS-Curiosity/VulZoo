Description:
     Previous versions of the lighttpd package are vulnerable to two denial of 
service attacks.  One is a remote denial of service that can cause lighttpd to 
consume all available CPU time and stop serving requests, and the other is a 
denial of service attack which generally requires a local user to create a file 
with an mtime of 0; the lighttpd daemon will crash when attempting to serve that 
file. This crash does not enable any arbitrary or directed code execution; 
however, since the rAA service (Foresight System Manager) uses lighttpd by 
default, and rAA is configured to start by default, all Foresight systems are 
vulnerable to this DoS by default. Once lighttpd has been crashed or made to 
stop serving requests, subsequent updates using the Foresight System Manager 
(rAA) will not occur.
