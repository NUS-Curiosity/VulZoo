Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2007-0013

Package names:	   clamav, freeradius, freetype
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2007-04-20
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0.5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  clamav
  Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose
  of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
  scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded
  daemon, a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via
  Internet. The programs are based on a shared library distributed with
  package, which you can use with your own software. Most importantly,
  the virus database is kept up to date.

  freeradius
  The FreeRADIUS Server Project is a high performance and highly 
  configurable GPL'd free RADIUS server. The server is similar in some
  respects to Livingston's 2.0 server. While FreeRADIUS started as a 
  variant of the Cistron RADIUS server, they don't share a lot in common
  any more. It now has many more features than Cistron or Livingston, 
  and is much more configurable.

  freetype
  The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering 
  engine, developed to provide TrueType support for a variety of 
  platforms and environments. FreeType is a library which can open
  and manages font files as well as efficiently load, hint and render
  individual glyphs. FreeType is not a font server or a complete
  text-rendering library.

Problem description:
  clamav < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: A file descriptor leak error in the 
    "chm_decompress_stream()" [libclamav/chmunpack.c] function, which
    could be exploited by attackers to crash an affected system via a
    specially crafted CHM file.
  - A buffer overflow error in the "cab_unstore()" [libclamav/cab.c]
    function when processing a negative value read from a CAB file,
    which could be exploited by attackers to crash an affected 
    application or compromise a vulnerable system via a specially
    crafted CAB file.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    names CVE-2007-1745 and CVE-2007-1997 to these issues.

  freeradius < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 >
  - New upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: A security issue has been reported in FreeRADIUS,
    caused due to a memory leak within the handling of certain 
    malformed diameter format values inside an EAP-TTLS tunnel. This
    can be exploited to exhaust all available memory by sending a 
    large number of malformed authentication requests to a vulnerable
    server.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2007-2028 to this issue.  
  
  freetype < TSL 3.0.5 > < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in FreeType, caused
    due to an integer overflow when parsing BDF fonts. This can be
    exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially
    crafted BDF font.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2007-1351 to this issue.
