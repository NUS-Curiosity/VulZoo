Computer Associates eTrust Intrusion Detection CallCode ActiveX Control
Code Execution Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.24.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 24, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Computer Associates eTrust Intrusion Detection is a network intrusion
management and prevention system, that includes real-time session
monitoring and Internet web filtering capabilities. More information
can be found on the vendor's site at the following URL.

http://supportconnectw.ca.com/public/etrust/etrust_intrusion/etrustintrusion_supp.asp

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a design error vulnerability in Computer
Associates International Inc.'s (CA) eTrust Intrusion Detection allows
attackers to execute arbitrary code.

When eTrust Intrusion Detection is installed it registers the following
ActiveX control as safe for scripting:

  File: Caller.dll
  Clsid: 41266C21-18D8-414B-88C0-8DCA6C25CEA0

This control contains a series of scriptable functions which allow
malicious web pages to load arbitrary DLLs and call their exports with
controlled parameters.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute code with the privileges of
the currently logged on user. The user would have to be lured into
visiting a malicious web page.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed that CA eTrust Intrusion Detection version 3.0.5
on Windows is vulnerable. The file version of caller.dll tested was
3.0.5.55.

V. WORKAROUND

Setting the kill-bit for this control will prevent it from being loaded
within Internet Explorer.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
