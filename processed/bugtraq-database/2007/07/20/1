   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2007-006
Advisory Title: Citrix EPA ActiveX Control Design Flaw
        Author: Michael White / michael_white@...antec.com
  Release Date: 19-07-2007
   Application: Citrix Access Gateway
      Platform: Internet Explorer/Win32
      Severity: Remote arbitrary code execution
 Vendor status: Patch available
    CVE Number: CVE-2007-3679
     Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/24865


Overview:

Citrix Access Gateway offers a clientless SSL VPN solution
implemented through a series of browser-based controls. As part of
the endpoint validation, the ActiveX control for Internet Explorer
downloads and executes a series of executable modules from the
remote server.

Details:

Researchers identified that the endpoint checking control can be
embedded in any web page and subverted to download and execute any
executable module of the attackerï¿½s choosing.

This vulnerability represents a design flaw in the architecture of
the endpoint validation practice.

A high level of browser trust is required to allow the endpoint
checks to function correctly, and the control is signed by Citrix
Corporation.

Vendor Response:

This has been addressed by a product update.
See http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX113815

Recommendation:

Apply the product update as detailed in 
http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX113815
