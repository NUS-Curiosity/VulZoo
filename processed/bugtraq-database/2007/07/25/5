Status and Recommendation:
CA has made patches available for all affected products.  These 
patches are independent of the CA Software that installed CAM.  
Simply select the patch appropriate to the platform, and the 
installed version of CAM, and follow the patch application 
instructions.  You should also review the product home pages on 
SupportConnect for any additional product specific instructions.

NetWare      QO89943

How to determine if you are affected:

Determining CAM versions:
Simply running camstat will return the version information in the 
top line of the output on any platform.  The camstat command is 
located in the bin subfolder of the installation directory. 

The example below indicates that CAM version 1.11 build 27 
increment 2 is running.

   E:\>camstat
   CAM â€“ machine.ca.com  Version 1.11 (Build 27_2) up 0 days 1:16

Determining the CAM install directory:

Windows: The install location is specified by the %CAI_MSQ% 
   environment variable.
Unix/Linux/Mac: The /etc/catngcampath text file holds the CAM 
   install location.

Workaround:
The affected listening port can be disabled by creating or 
updating CAM's configuration file, CAM.CFG, with the following 
entry under the "*CONFIG" section:

   *CONFIG
   cas_port=0

The CA Messaging Server must be recycled in order for this to take 
effect.  We advise that products dependent upon CAM should be 
shutdown prior to recycling CAM.  Once dependent products have 
been shutdown, CAM can be recycled with the following commands:

   On Windows:
      camclose
      cam start

   On NetWare:
      load camclose
      load cam start

Once CAM has been restarted, any CAM dependent products that were 
shutdown can be restarted.
