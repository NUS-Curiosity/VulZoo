Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GIMP, allowing for the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/gimp      < 2.2.16                            >= 2.2.16

Description
===========

Sean Larsson from iDefense Labs discovered multiple integer overflows
in various GIMP plugins (CVE-2006-4519). Stefan Cornelius from Secunia
Research discovered an integer overflow in the
seek_to_and_unpack_pixeldata() function when processing PSD files
(CVE-2007-2949).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted image
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running GIMP.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GIMP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/gimp-2.2.16"
