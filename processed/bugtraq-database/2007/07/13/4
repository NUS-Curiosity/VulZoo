TPTI-07-12: Multiple Vendor Progress Server Heap Overflow Vulnerability
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-07-12.html
July 12, 2007

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2007-2417

-- Affected Vendor:
Progress Software

-- Affected Products:
RSA Authentication Manager
Progress Database

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since May 22, 2007 by Digital Vaccine protection
filter ID 5326. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RSA Authentication Manager and other
products that include the Progress server. User interaction is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the Progress Server listening by default on
TCP ports 5520 and 5530. The _mprosrv.exe process trusts a user-supplied
DWORD size and attempts to receive that amount of data into a statically
allocated heap buffer. 

The user-supplied size parameter is used directly as an argument to
recv() as shown below:

_mprosrv.exe:
    0044F24F mov     eax, [esp+42Ch+buf] ; 1012 byte heap buffer
    0044F253 push    0                   ; flags
    0044F255 push    esi                 ; attacker-controlled size
    0044F256 push    eax                 ; 1012 byte heap buffer
    0044F257 push    edi                 ; s
    0044F258 call    recv

The heap buffer which is received into is 1012 bytes. Sending more than
1012 bytes will overflow into subsequent heap chunks. This heap
corruption can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the SYSTEM user.
