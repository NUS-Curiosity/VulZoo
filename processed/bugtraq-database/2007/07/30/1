Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in tcpdump, allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code, possibly with root privileges.

Background
==========

tcpdump is a tool for capturing and inspecting network traffic.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/tcpdump     < 3.9.5-r3                   >= 3.9.5-r3

Description
===========

mu-b from Digital Labs discovered that the return value of a snprintf()
call is not properly checked before being used. This could lead to an
integer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted BGP packets on a network
being monitored with tcpdump, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running tcpdump, which
is usually root.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All tcpdump users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/tcpdump-3.9.5-r3"
