   Advisory ID: SYMSA-2007-004
Advisory Title: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Xythos Server Products
        Author: Brian Reilly / brian_reilly@...antec.com
  Release Date: 26-06-2007
   Application: Xythos Enterprise Document Manager (XEDM) and Xythos
                Digital Locker (XDL) 5.0 and 6.0\
      Platform: All
      Severity: Remotely exploitable / Full application control
 Vendor status: Verified by vendor, patches available
    CVE Number: CVE-2007-3254, CVE-2007-3255, CVE-2007-3256 [Requested]
     Reference: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/24521


Overview:

     Xythos Enterprise Document Manager (XEDM) is a web-based
     document management system that provides features including
     document check-in, check-out, version control, workflow,
     sharing, classification, retention schedules.  Xythos
     Enterprise Document Manager 6.0 is compliant with the U.S
     Department of Defense (DoD) 5015.2-Standard (STD) for records
     management systems.

     XEDM is vulnerable to multiple HTML and JavaScript injection
     attacks.  The application fails to sanitize user input in a
     number of locations, and these vulnerabilities can be leveraged
     to conduct stored and reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and
     Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).  Although XEDM 6.0 uses
     unique action tokens to decrease the risk of CSRF, these
     tokens can be obtained via XSS thereby allowing an attacker to
     circumvent this countermeasure.  Successful exploitation can
     lead to an attacker gaining complete control of user accounts,
     directories, files, and the XEDM administrative interface.

     All XEDM users also have the ability to set the Content Type
     of their files, and subsequently share them with other XEDM
     users or external Internet users.  There is no administrative
     or server-side control to remove this ability from selected
     users, nor is there a way for administrators to globally set
     the Content Type based on file extension or actual file
     contents.  As a result, malicious XEDM users have an easy way
     to distribute URLs from a trusted XEDM server that link to
     files which may appear to be "safe," but actually contain
     dangerous content.

     Please note that XEDM was the only application tested by
     Symantec Vulnerability Research.  Based on information provided
     by Xythos, Xythos Digital Locker (XDL) is also affected by
     vulnerabilities #3, #4, and #5 described in this advisory


Details: 

     Vulnerability #1:  Persistent XSS and CSRF Vulnerability in a
     File Workflow Name

     XEDM�s Workflow feature allows users to manage and monitor the
     state of their documents with defined routing, reviews,
     approvals, and notifications between multiple users.  The
     application performs no input validation on the name of a
     saved Workflow, allowing an attacker to include HTML,
     JavaScript, and other active content.  Exploitation occurs
     when an administrator logs into the Xythos administrative
     interface and exports Workflow definitions.  Attackers can
     trigger arbitrary XSS and CSRF payloads, thereby gaining
     complete control of the administrative interface and
     performing such actions as changing server configuration
     options and creating, modifying, or deleting XEDM users

     Vulnerability #2:  Persistent XSS Vulnerability in a File
     Workflow Name

     There is an additional exploitation vector for Workflow names
     that contain active content.  When a user deletes a Workflow
     template that contains such content, the payload is triggered.
     Due to likely attack scenarios, this vulnerability is less
     significant than the others described in this advisory

     Vulnerability #3: Persistent XSS and CSRF Vulnerability in a
     File Content-Type Value

     All XEDM users are able to change the Content Type of all
     files in their directories to ensure they are handled by the
     correct client applications.  In addition to being displayed
     in HTTP Response headers when downloading a file, this
     information is also displayed within XEDM when users view a
     file�s properties.  The web form to set a file�s Content Type
     uses a MAXLENGTH value in an <INPUT> tag to enforce a maximum
     length of 30 characters.  However, it is trivial to set
     Content-Types of an arbitrary length above this limit by using
     a client Web proxy, a custom browser, or an HTTP API.  The
     only server-side validation performed on a user-supplied
     Content-Type is that it must contain a forward slash, allowing
     an attacker to include HTML, JavaScript, and other active
     content.  Exploitation occurs when another XDEM user views the
     file�s properties or "manages" the file.  Attackers can
     trigger arbitrary XSS and CSRF payloads, thereby gaining
     complete control of the user�s account, and performing actions
     including changing file permissions, and creating, modifying
     and deleting files and directories

     Vulnerability #4: Reflected XSS Vulnerability in the File
     Upload Action

     XEDM is also vulnerable to a reflected XSS vulnerability that
     is exploited when the user uploads a file that contains HTML,
     JavaScript, or other active content in the filename.
     Successful exploitation can result in the standard XSS
     payloads. Due to likely attack scenarios, this vulnerability
     is less significant than the others described in this
     advisory.

     Vulnerability #5:  Distributing Malicious Content due to
     Misleading URLs and User-Supplied File Content Types

     As mentioned in the details of Vulnerability #3, all XEDM
     users are able to change the Content Types of all files in
     their directories.  While this behavior is similar to
     functionality offered by other web applications and web
     servers (such as the AddType directive in an Apache .htaccess
     file), there is no way for an administrator to globally set
     MIME types for certain file extensions or override user-set
     options (such as an 'AllowOverride None' directive in an
     Apache HTTP server configuration file).  As a result,
     malicious users have an easy way to distribute URLs from a
     trusted XEDM server that link to files which may appear to be
     "safe," but actually contain dangerous content.  For example,
     a URL of the syntax
     https://some.xythos.server.tld/home/jdoe/perfectlysafe.txt and
     a Content Type of application/msword could really distribute a
     payload such as a zero-day Microsoft Office exploit.  Other
     payloads include hostile executables, HTML, JavaScript, or any
     other malicious content with an arbitrary filename and the
     appropriate MIME type set


Vendor Response:
     Xythos has confirmed potential security vulnerabilities in
     earlier versions of the 5.0 and 6.0 releases of its server
     products, the Xythos WebFile Server, Xythos Digital Locker
     (XDL), and Enterprise Document Manager (XEDM).  We recommend
     that Xythos customers upgrade to the 5.0.25.8 or 6.0.46.1
     versions of these products, planned for release by the end of
     June 2007.
       
     Important note: One of the identified vulnerabilities, listed
     as issue #5 in the Symantec advisory (Distributing Malicious
     Content due to Misleading URLs and User-Supplied File Content
     Types), is addressed only in the 6.0 release of these server
     products, but not in release 5.0.  Xythos considers the
     resolution to this vulnerability (allowing administrators to
     disallow the editing of a file's content type by end users) to
      be a new feature, introduced in release 6.0 of XEDM/XDL.

     We encourage Xythos customers to contact Xythos Customer Support
     (support@...hos.com) if you have questions about these security
     issues, and to get the identified upgrades, when available.



Recommendation:
     To address the vulnerabilities identified in this advisory,
     current XEDM and XDL customers are strongly encouraged to upgrade
     to version 5.0.25.8 or 6.0.46.1 (or higher) of the XEDM/XDL.
