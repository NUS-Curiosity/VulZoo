Description:
    Previous versions of the emacs package are vulnerable to a denial
    of service attack in which attacker-provided malformed or malicious
    GIF images can cause emacs to crash, possibly resulting in loss of
    any unsaved data.  It is not believed that this vulnerability can
    be exploited to execute malicious code.
