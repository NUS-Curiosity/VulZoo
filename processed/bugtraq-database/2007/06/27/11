The ERP kits use dupatch to install and will not install over any installed Customer Specific Patches (CSPs) that have file intersections with the ERPs. Contact your service provider for assistance if the installation of the ERPs is blocked by any of your installed CSPs.

The resolutions contained in the ERP kits are targeted for availability in the following mainstream patch kits:

PRODUCT SPECIFIC INFORMATION 

The HP Tru64 UNIX v 5.1B-3 and v 5.1B-4 ERP kits distribute two patches:

OpenSSL 0.9.8d 
BIND 9.2.8 built with OpenSSL 0.9.8d 
BIND 9.2.8 built with OpenSSL 0.9.8d 

Note: HP Tru64 UNIX v 5.1A, v 4.0G, and v 4.0F releases did not distribute OpenSSL and so their ERP kits provide only the BIND 9.2.8 patch that has been built with OpenSSL 0.9.8d

Customers who have been using OpenSSL on HP Tru64 UNIX v 5.1B-3 and v 5.1B-4 should install the OpenSSL patch from the ERP kit appropriate for their base operating system version.

The HP Insight Management Agents for Tru64 UNIX patch contains OpenSSL 0.9.8d and is applicable for HP Tru64 UNIX v 5.1A, v 5.1B-3, and v 5.1B-4.
