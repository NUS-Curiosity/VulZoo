 Corruption Vulnerabilities

Ingres Database Multiple Heap Corruption Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 06.21.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 21, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Ingres is the database backend used by default in several CA products.
The SCM (Secure Content Manager) is one of the products that uses
Ingres. The SCM use Ingres to store quarantined virii and blocked HTTP
requests/replies. For more information visit the following URLs.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple heap overflow vulnerabilities in Ingres
Database Server as distributed with Computer Associates International
Inc.'s (CA) products may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with
SYSTEM privileges.

The vulnerabilities exist in the Communications Server (iigcc.exe) and
Data Access Server (iigcd.exe) components of Ingres. The Communications
Server is the main component responsible for receiving and handling
requests from the network. The Data Access Server is responsible for
handling requests from the Ingres JDBC Driver and .NET data providers.
These requests are decoded into Ingres internal formats and passed on
to other components of the database server.

The application does not properly validate the length of attacker
supplied data before copying it into a fixed size heap buffer. This
leads to an exploitable condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary
code with SYSTEM privileges.

In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker would have to send a
malformed request to the database server. This requires the ability to
establish a TCP session on port 10916 (iigcc) or 10923 (iigcd).

Exploitation has been demonstrated to be trivial.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Ingres
Database 3.0.3 as included with CA eTrust Secure Content Manager r8 on
Windows. Previous versions may also be affected. In addition, any
application that uses the Ingres Database may be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Employing firewalls or other access control methods can effectively
reduce exposure to this vulnerability.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

CA has made fixes available for all supported CA products that embed
Ingres. For more information consult CA's Security Alert at the
following URL.
