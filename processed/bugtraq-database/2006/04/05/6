---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated mod_python package fixes a security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152896
Issue date:        2006-04-04
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix, Security
CVE Name:          CVE-2005-0088
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An Updated mod_python package that fixes a security issue in the
publisher handler is now available.

Mod_python is a module that embeds the Python language interpreter
within the Apache web server, allowing handlers to be written in Python.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386

3. Problem description:

Graham Dumpleton discovered a flaw affecting the publisher handler of
mod_python, used to make objects inside modules callable via URL.
A remote user could visit a carefully crafted URL that would gain access
to objects that should not be visible, leading to an information leak.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2005-0088 to this issue.

Users of mod_python are advised to upgrade to this updated package,
which contains a backported patch to correct this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
