               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated cyrus-imapd packages fix security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:156290
Issue date:        2006-04-04
Product:           Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix, Security
CVE Names:         CVE-2005-0546
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated cyrus-imapd packages that fix several buffer overflow security
issues are now available.

The cyrus-imapd package contains the core of the Cyrus IMAP server.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

Several buffer overflow bugs were found in cyrus-imapd.  It is possible
that an authenticated malicious user could cause the imap server to
crash.  Additionally, a peer news admin could potentially execute
arbitrary code on the imap server when news is received using the
fetchnews command.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2005-0546 to this issue.

Users of cyrus-imapd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain cyrus-imapd version 2.2.12 to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
