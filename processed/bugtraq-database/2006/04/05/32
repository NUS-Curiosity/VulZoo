Synopsis
========

Kaffeine is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Kaffeine is a graphical front-end for the xine-lib multimedia library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/kaffeine     < 0.7.1-r2                   >= 0.7.1-r2

Description
===========

Kaffeine uses an unchecked buffer when fetching remote RAM playlists
via HTTP.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to play a specially-crafted RAM
playlist resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Kaffeine users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/kaffeine-0.7.1-r2"
