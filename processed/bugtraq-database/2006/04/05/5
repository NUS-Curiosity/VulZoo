---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated xine package fixes security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:152873
Issue date:        2006-04-04
Product:           Red Hat Linux 7.3
Keywords:          Bugfix, Security
CVE Names:         CVE-2004-0372, CVE-2004-1379
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated xine package that fixes security bugs is now available.

xine is a free gpl-licensed video player for unix-like systems.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

A vulnerability has been reported in the way xine handles a bug report
email. A local user could create a specially crafted symlink which could
result in xine overwriting a file which it has write access to. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2004-0372 to this issue.

A heap overflow has been found in the DVD subpicture decoder of
xine-lib. This can be used for a remote heap overflow exploit, which
can, on some systems, lead to or help in executing malicious code with
the permissions of the user running a xine-lib based media application.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name
CVE-2004-1379 to this issue.

All users of xine should upgrade to this updated package, which includes
backported patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
