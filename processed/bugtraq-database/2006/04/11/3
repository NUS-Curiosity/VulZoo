Overview:

RealPlayer is an application for playing various media formats,
developed by RealNetworks Inc. For more information, visit
http://www.real.com/.

Details:

There are multiple vulnerabilities found in swfformat.dll.
A carefully crafted .swf file may execute arbitrary code or crash the
RealPlayer.

By persuading a user to access a specially crafted SWF file with RealPlayer,
a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.
And also, these vulnerabilities can be triggered remotely through ActiveX
in IE.

By setting the size of SWF files to a value smaller than the actual size,
you can trigger one of the vulnerabilities.

Actually, there are multiple holes that have been fixed in swfformat.dll.

POC:

No PoC will be released for this.
