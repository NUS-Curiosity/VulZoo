Synopsis
========

fbida is vulnerable to linking attacks, potentially allowing a local
user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

fbida is a collection of image viewers and editors for the framebuffer
console and X11.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/fbida      < 2.03-r3                         >= 2.03-r3

Description
===========

Jan Braun has discovered that the "fbgs" script provided by fbida
insecurely creates temporary files in the "/var/tmp" directory.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create links in the temporary file directory,
pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When an affected
script is called, this could result in the file being overwritten with
the rights of the user running the script.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All fbida users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/fbida-2.03-r3"
