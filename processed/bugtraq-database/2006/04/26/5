ZDI-06-011: Mozilla Firefox Table Rebuilding Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-06-011.html
April 25, 2006

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2006-0748

-- Affected Vendor:
Mozilla

-- Affected Products:
Firefox 1.5 - 1.5.0.1
Firefox 1.0 - 1.0.7
Thunderbird 1.5 - 1.5.0.1
Thunderbird 1.0 - 1.0.7
SeaMonkey 1.0
Mozilla Suite 1.7 - 1.7.12

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Mozilla/Firefox web browser and
Thunderbird e-mail client. User interaction is required to exploit this
vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a
malicious e-mail.

The specific flaw exists within the routine RebuildConsideringRows()
during the rebuilding of nonsensical table tags. When the Mozilla
engine attempts to fix the malformed table, an attacker is capable of
triggering a memory corruption that can lead to code execution from
user-supplied data.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. Further
details are available at:
