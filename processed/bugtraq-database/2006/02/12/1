Synopsis
========

Xpdf and Poppler are vulnerable to a heap overflow that may be
exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Xpdf is a PDF file viewer that runs under the X Window System. Poppler
is a PDF rendering library based on the Xpdf 3.0 code base.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

  2  app-text/poppler     < 0.5.0-r4                       >= 0.5.0-r4
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.

Description
===========

Dirk Mueller has reported a vulnerability in Xpdf. It is caused by a
missing boundary check in the splash rasterizer engine when handling
PDF splash images with overly large dimensions.

Impact
======

By sending a specially crafted PDF file to a victim, an attacker could
cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Xpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/xpdf-3.01-r7"

All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/poppler-0.5.0-r4"
