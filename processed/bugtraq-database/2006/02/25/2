---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated nfs-utils package fixes security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:138098
Issue date:        2006-02-25
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2004-0946 CVE-2004-1014
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated nfs-utils package that fixes security issues is now
available.

The nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and
related tools, providing a much higher level of performance than the
traditional Linux NFS server used by most users.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

Arjan van de Ven discovered a buffer overflow in rquotad. On 64-bit
architectures, an improper integer conversion can lead to a buffer
overflow. An attacker with access to an NFS share could send a specially
crafted request which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned the name CVE-2004-0946 to this issue.

In addition, the Fedora Core 2 update fixes the following issue:

SGI reported that the statd daemon did not properly handle the SIGPIPE
signal. A misconfigured or malicious peer could cause statd to crash,
leading to a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2004-1014 to this
issue.

All users of nfs-utils should upgrade to this updated package, which
resolves these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.

tampered with, examine only the sha1sum with the following command:

    sha1sum <filename>
