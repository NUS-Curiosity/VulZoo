Subject: [FLSA-2006:181014] Updated gnutls packages fix a security issue

---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated gnutls packages fix a security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:181014
Issue date:        2006-02-27
Product:           Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2006-0645
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

Updated gnutls packages that fix a security issue are now available.

The GNU TLS Library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and
protocols such as TLS. GNU TLS includes Libtasn1, a library developed
for ASN.1 structures management that includes DER encoding and decoding.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Fedora Core 3 - i386, x86_64

3. Problem description:

Several flaws were found in the way libtasn1 decodes DER. An attacker
could create a carefully crafted invalid X.509 certificate in such a way
that could trigger this flaw if parsed by an application that uses GNU
TLS. This could lead to a denial of service (application crash). It is
not certain if this issue could be escalated to allow arbitrary code
execution. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the
name CVE-2006-0645 to this issue.

Users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch from the GNU TLS maintainers to correct this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
