---------------------------------------------------------------------
               Fedora Legacy Update Advisory

Synopsis:          Updated auth_ldap package fixes security issue
Advisory ID:       FLSA:177694
Issue date:        2006-02-27
Product:           Red Hat Linux
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2006-0150
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Topic:

An updated auth_ldap package that fixes a format string security issue
is now available for Red Hat Linux 7.3.

The auth_ldap package is an httpd module that allows user authentication
against information stored in an LDAP database.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386

3. Problem description:

A format string flaw was found in the way auth_ldap logs information. It
may be possible for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the
'apache' user if auth_ldap is used for user authentication. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name
CVE-2006-0150 to this issue.

Note that this issue only affects servers that have auth_ldap installed
and configured to perform user authentication against an LDAP database.

All users of auth_ldap should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains a backported patch to resolve this issue.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
