Synopsis
========

Applications relying on GnuPG to authenticate digital signatures may
incorrectly believe a signature has been verified.

Background
==========

GnuPG (The GNU Privacy Guard) is a free replacement for PGP (Pretty
Good Privacy). As GnuPG does not rely on any patented algorithms, it
can be used without any restrictions. gpgv is the OpenPGP signature
verification tool provided by the GnuPG system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-crypt/gnupg      < 1.4.2.1                         >= 1.4.2.1

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Auditing Team discovered
that automated systems relying on the return code of GnuPG or gpgv to
authenticate digital signatures may be misled by malformed signatures.
GnuPG documentation states that a return code of zero (0) indicates
success, however gpg and gpgv may also return zero if no signature data
was found in a detached signature file.

Impact
======

An attacker may be able to bypass authentication in automated systems
relying on the return code of gpg or gpgv to authenticate digital
signatures.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GnuPG users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-crypt/gnupg-1.4.2.1"
