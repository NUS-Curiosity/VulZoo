Product Description:

> From IBM's Website[1][2]:

 "IBM Tivoli Access Manager for e-business is an award winning,
  policy-based access control solution for e-business and enterprise
  applications that is in the leader quadrant of Gartner's Magic
  Quadrant. Tivoli Access Manager for e-business can help you manage
  growth and complexity, control escalating management costs and address

  of security in a secure domain by requiring each client to provide
  proof of identity. Comprehensive network security can be provided by
  having Tivoli Access Manager Plug-in for Web Servers control the
  authentication and authorization of clients."



Vulnerability Overview:

On December 1st, while conducting a penetration test of a TAM enabled web
application, VSR identified a vulnerability in Tivoli Web Server Plug-in
which is a component of Tivoli Access Manager (TAM).  This flaw allows an
authenticated attacker to retrieve files (which reside outside of the web
root) from the web server on which the plug-in resides.  It is
possible to
retrieve any file or list any directory which is readable by the web
server
software.


Vulnerability Details:

IBM's TAM Plug-in contains a logout handler under the root web path named
`pkmslogout'.  This handler is designed to log out authenticated users.
The handler's display template can be specified by the `filename' request
parameter.  The value of this parameter is intended to be the partial path
to a file on the web server which contains the page template.  This file
path is vulnerable to directory traversal, and can be used to retrieve
nearly arbitrary files from the web server hosting the TAM Plug-in.

For instance, if a vulnerable plug-in existed on the system
tam.example.com,
one could exploit the problem by hitting a URL such as:
 http://tam.example.com/pkmslogout?filename=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

It appears this problem can only be triggered when the attacker is
already authenticated through the Web Plug-in.



Vendor Response:
IBM was first notified on 2005-12-05. Initial response was received on
2005-12-06.  A patch for this issue was released (For versions 5.1.0) on
2006-01-18 and was published as a Limited availability fix:

A generally available fix pack for version 5.1.0 and 6.0 was released by
the vendor on 2006-02-03 and available as:

Fixpack 5.1.0-TIV-WPI-FP0017 is available at:
