Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0008

Package names:	   gnupg, gnutls, libtasn1, postgresql  
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-02-17
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  gnupg
  GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because it does not
  use IDEA it can be used without any restrictions. GnuPG is in compliance
  with the OpenPGP specification (RFC2440).

  gnutls
  GnuTLS is a project that aims to develop a library which provides a secure
  layer, over a reliable transport layer. Currently the GnuTLS library
  implements the proposed standards by the IETF's TLS working group.

  libtasn1
  This is the ASN.1 library used in GNUTLS.

  postgresql
  PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system
  (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including
  transactions, subselects and user-defined types and functions). The
  postgresql package includes the client programs and libraries that
  you'll need to access a PostgreSQL DBMS server.  These PostgreSQL
  client programs are programs that directly manipulate the internal
  structure of PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server. These client
  programs can be located on the same machine with the PostgreSQL
  server, or may be on a remote machine which accesses a PostgreSQL
  server over a network connection. This package contains the docs
  in HTML for the whole package, as well as command-line utilities for
  managing PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server.

Problem description:
  gnupg < TSL 3.0 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Taviso has reported a verification weakness in gpgv where
    some input could lead to gpgv exiting with 0 even if the detached
    signature file did not carry any signature.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-0455 to this issue.

  gnutls < TSL 3.0 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Evgeny Legerov has reported some vulnerabilities in
    GnuTLS libtasn1, which potentially can be exploited by malicious
    people to cause a DoS. The vulnerabilities are caused due to errors
    within the DER decoder in libtasn1. This can be exploited to crash an
    application that uses the library via specially-crafted input.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-0645 to this issue.  

  libtasn1 < TSL 3.0 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Evgeny Legerov has reported some vulnerabilities in
    libtasn1, which potentially can be exploited by malicious
    people to cause a DoS. The vulnerabilities are caused due to errors
    within the DER decoder in libtasn1. This can be exploited to crash an
    application that uses the library via specially-crafted input.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-0645 to this issue.

  postgresql < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Akio Ishida has reported an error in "SET SESSION
    AUTHORIZATION" command which can be exploited to crash the server
    process, if it has been compiled with Asserts enabled.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-0678 to this issue.
