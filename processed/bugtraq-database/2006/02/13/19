Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in ImageMagick allows attackers to crash the
application and potentially execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ImageMagick is an application suite to manipulate and convert images.
It is often used as a utility backend by web applications like forums,
content management systems or picture galleries.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/imagemagick      < 6.2.5.5                   >= 6.2.5.5

Description
===========

The SetImageInfo function was found vulnerable to a format string
mishandling. Daniel Kobras discovered that the handling of "%"-escaped
sequences in filenames passed to the function is inadequate. This is a
new vulnerability that is not addressed by GLSA 200503-11.

Impact
======

By feeding specially crafted file names to ImageMagick, an attacker can
crash the program and possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running ImageMagick.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ImageMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/imagemagick-6.2.5.5"
