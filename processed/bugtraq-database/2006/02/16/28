Synopsis
========

BomberClone is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which may lead to remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

BomberClone is a remake of the classic game "BomberMan". It supports
multiple players via IP network connection.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /    Vulnerable    /         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  games-action/bomberclone      < 0.11.6.2-r1        >= 0.11.6.2-r1

Description
===========

Stefan Cornelius of the Gentoo Security team discovered multiple
missing buffer checks in BomberClone's code.

Impact
======

By sending overly long error messages to the game via network, a remote
attacker may exploit buffer overflows to execute arbitrary code with
the rights of the user running BomberClone.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All BomberClone users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=games-action/bomberclone-0.11.6.2-r1"
