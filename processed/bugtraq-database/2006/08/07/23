Synopsis
========

VNC servers created with x11vnc accept insecure protocol types, even
when the server does not offer it, resulting in the possibility of
unauthorized access to the server.

Background
==========

x11vnc provides VNC servers for X displays.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-misc/x11vnc       < 0.8.1                            >= 0.8.1

Description
===========

x11vnc includes vulnerable LibVNCServer code, which fails to properly
validate protocol types effectively letting users decide what protocol
to use, such as "Type 1 - None" (GLSA-200608-05). x11vnc will accept
this security type, even if it is not offered by the server.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized
access with the privileges of the user running the VNC server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All x11vnc users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-misc/x11vnc-0.8.1"
