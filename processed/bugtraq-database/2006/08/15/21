Subject: Re: TSRT-06-02: Microsoft SRV.SYS Mailslot Ring0 Memory Corruption
 Vulnerability

There's still an unpatched DOS for the server service as blogged on the 
MSRC blog:

Also - an additional point of clarification - its important to 
distinguish that while MS06-040 
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-040.mspx%20> 
addresses a vulnerability in the Server Service it does not resolve the 
Denial of Service issue I spoke about earlier on the blog in the 
"Information About Public Postings Related to MS06-035 
<http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/07/28/443837.aspx>" posting. 
We are still working on the security update for the Denial of Service 
issue and the report for it came in after we had completed our testing 
cycle for MS06-040 
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-040.mspx%20>. 
With the importance and potential severity previously 
mentioned regarding MS06-040 
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-040.mspx%20>we 
felt it was important to get the security update for MS06-040 
<http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS06-040.mspx%20>out 
as soon as possible. We'll continue working on the DoS issue and will 
release a security update once it's reached an appropriate level of quality.

All tested systems have been patched with the latest available patches from Microsoft as of today, August 14th, 2006 4:00 PM MESZ, using both the standard Windows Update function and applying patches by hand.
