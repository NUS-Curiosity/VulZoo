Release Mode: FORCED RELEASE

*Vulnerability Description:*

While investigating the Microsoft Server Service Mailslot heap overflow
vulnerability reported in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-035 [1], Core
Security Technologies researcher Gerardo Richarte discovered a second bug
in the server service.

This new vulnerability affects Windows systems with and without the
MS06-035 and any subsequent patches up to the date of publication of this
advisory.

Proof-of-concept code to exploit the vulnerability was made publicly
available in or around July 19th, 2006 and at least one third party
security vendor published a security advisory describing the bug.

Further analysis of the vulnerability seems to indicate that exploitation
is limited to a remote denial of service attack without the need of user
authentication.

The vendor was notified of the finding on July 14th, 2006 and has
indicated that issuance of a fix is tentatively scheduled for the November
patch release. [see "Vendors contacted" section above]

*Vulnerable Packages:*
- Windows 2000 SP0-Sp4
- Windows NT4 SP6a
- Windows XP SP0-SP2
- Windows 2003 SP0-SP1

*Not vulnerable Packages:*
- Windows Vista beta 2 build 5381

*Solution/Vendor Information/Workaround:*
. Block inbound connections to ports 139/tcp and 445/tcp
. IDS/IPS signatures should detect the presence of strings not
  terminated with NUL in SMB_COM_TRANSACTION messages

*Credits:*

This vulnerability was accidentally found by Gerardo Richarte from Core
Security Technologies while looking for technical details about Microsoft
Security Bulletin MS06-035

*Technical Description - Exploit/Concept Code:*

The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a malformed
SMB_COM_TRANSACTION SMB message (0x25) that includes a string that is not
properly null terminated.

The crash was originally triggered by sending a SMB_COM_TRANSACTION
message using the string "\\MAILSLOT\LANMAN" (without NUL termination) in
an attempt to reproduce the MS06-035 bug(s).

The observed crash was actually inside __imp___wcsnicmp, when the string
"\\MAILSLOT" is compared to a NULL pointer. The following code, from
ExecuteTransaction(), is where wcsnicmp() is called from.

SRV.SYS:0002f487:    push 9
SRV.SYS:0002f489:    push "\\MAILSLOT"
SRV.SYS:0002f48f:    push dword ptr [eax+24h]     <-- [eax+24] is NULL
SRV.SYS:0002f492:    call ds:__imp___wcsnicmp     <-- Crash Inside (tm)
SRV.SYS:0002f498:    add esp, 0ch
SRV.SYS:0002f49b:    test eax, eax
SRV.SYS:0002f49d:    jnz loc_2f4aa
SRV.SYS:0002f49f:    push esi
SRV.SYS:0002f4a0:    call _MailslotTransaction@4  <- execution flow does
                                                     not reach this point
SRV.SYS:0002f4a5:    jmp loc_20bf6
SRV.SYS:0002f4aa:

Since the call to MailslotTransaction() is never reached and the crash is
triggered before that call we conclude that the bug is not specifically
related to MAILSLOT functionality. Upon further investigation it became
apparent that any SMB_COM_TRANSACTION message with a string that is not
null terminated will trigger a crash.
