Synopsis
========

Wireshark is vulnerable to several security issues that may lead to a
Denial of Service and/or the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Wireshark is a feature-rich network protocol analyzer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/wireshark      < 0.99.3                    >= 0.99.3

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark.
Firstly, if the IPsec ESP parser is used it is susceptible to
off-by-one errors, this parser is disabled by default; secondly, the
SCSI dissector is vulnerable to an unspecified crash; and finally, the
Q.2931 dissector of the SSCOP payload may use all the available memory
if a port range is configured. By default, no port ranges are
configured.

Impact
======

An attacker might be able to exploit these vulnerabilities, resulting
in a crash or the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user running Wireshark, possibly the root user.

Workaround
==========

Disable the SCSI and Q.2931 dissectors with the "Analyse" and "Enabled
protocols" menus. Make sure the ESP decryption is disabled, with the
"Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> ESP" menu.

Resolution
==========

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.3"
