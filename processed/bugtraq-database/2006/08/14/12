NGSSoftware Insight Security Research Advisory

Name: SQLIDEBUG envariable overflow on Informix
Systems Affected: 9.40.xC6 and earlier and 10.00.xC2, C1
Severity: High
Vendor URL: http://www.ibm.com/
Author: David Litchfield [ davidl@...software.com ]
Date of Public Advisory: 2nd August 2006
Advisory number: #NISR02082006G

Advisory URL: http://www.ngssoftware.com/research/

Description
***********
Informix Dynamic Server is a database developed by IBM. During a security 
assessment of Informix it was discovered that an overflow could be triggered 
in a shared library with the SQLIDEBUG environment variable. This can be 
triggered to gain root privileges by accessing one of the setuid root 
binaries such as onmode.

Details
*******
There's a buffer overflow in most of the setuid root programs in Informix 
running on Linux. The problem arises due to an overly long SQLIDEBUG 
environment variable of the form

SQLIDEBUG=1:/long-file-name

At bytes 272-6 in the long "filename" the saved return address on the stack 
is overwritten.



Fix Information
***************
IBM was alerted to this flaw on the 13th January 2005. Patches have now been 
made available.
