Synopsis
========

Heartbeat is vulnerable to a Denial of Service which can be triggered
by a remote attacker without authentication.

Background
==========

Heartbeat is a component of the High-Availability Linux project. It is
used to perform death-of-node detection, communications and cluster
management.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-cluster/heartbeat       < 2.0.7                      >= 2.0.7

Description
===========

Yan Rong Ge discovered that the peel_netstring() function in
cl_netstring.c does not validate the "length" parameter of user input,
which can lead to an out-of-bounds memory access when processing
certain Heartbeat messages (CVE-2006-3121). Furthermore an unspecified
local DoS issue was fixed (CVE-2006-3815).

Impact
======

By sending a malicious UDP Heartbeat message, even before
authentication, a remote attacker can crash the master control process
of the cluster.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Heartbeat users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-cluster/heartbeat-2.0.7"
