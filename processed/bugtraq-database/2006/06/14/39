Synopsis
========

Asterisk contains a bug in the IAX2 channel driver making it vulnerable
to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Asterisk is an open source implementation of a telephone private branch
exchange (PBX).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /   Vulnerable   /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/asterisk      < 1.0.11_p1                   >= 1.0.11_p1

Description
===========

Asterisk fails to properly check the length of truncated video frames
in the IAX2 channel driver which results in a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially
crafted IAX2 video stream resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the permissions of the user running Asterisk.

Workaround
==========

Disable public IAX2 support.

Resolution
==========

All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/asterisk-1.0.11_p1"
