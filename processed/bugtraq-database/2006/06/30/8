-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple iTunes. Exploitation requires an
attacker to convince a target user into opening a malicious play list
file.

The specific flaw exists during the processing of malicious AAC media
files such as those with extensions .M4A and .M4P. During the parsing
of the sample table size atom (STSZ), a malformed 'sample_size_table'
value can trigger an integer overflow leading to an exploitable memory
corruption.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has addressed this issue in the latest release of iTunes, version
6.0.5. More information is available from the vendor web site at:
