Synopsis
========

Mutt contains a buffer overflow that could result in arbitrary code
execution.

Background
==========

Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-client/mutt      < 1.5.11-r2                    >= 1.5.11-r2

Description
===========

TAKAHASHI Tamotsu has discovered that Mutt contains a boundary error in
the "browse_get_namespace()" function in browse.c, which can be
triggered when receiving an overly long namespace from an IMAP server.

Impact
======

A malicious IMAP server can send an overly long namespace to Mutt in
order to crash the application, and possibly execute arbitrary code
with the permissions of the user running Mutt.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mutt users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mutt-1.5.11-r2"

==========
