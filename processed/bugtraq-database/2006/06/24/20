Microsoft states at their Security Advisory #921365 that the first Excel vulnerability is exploited when Excel enters Repair Mode.
Details about the affected component is not published, however. See Workarounds for Microsoft Excel Remote Code Vulnerability section.

It appears that two references mentioned in code posting Steve points are erroneous.
Code posting says about error while handling malformed URL strings; i.e. vulnerability mentioned at

http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/06/20/437826.aspx

Some vendors use title related to Office vulnerability, some use term Windows vulnerability.

Another problem is, that there are 0-day characterics in all of these three issues.
It will cause similarities in namig process. It is not good.
Additionally, we have several code execution type Excel vulnarabilities with similar names now.
