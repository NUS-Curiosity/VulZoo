Security Advisory

Advisory ID   : SYMSA-2006-005
Advisory Title: Lanap CAPTCHA bypass exposure
Author        : Michael White, michael_white@...antec.com and
		Graham Murphy, graham_murphy@...antec.com
Release Date  : 23-06-2006
Application   : BotDetect Lanap CAPTCHA component
Platform      : ASP.NET
Severity      : Low/Limited exposure
Vendor status : Vendor verified, patch available
CVE Number    : CVE-2006-2918
Reference     : http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18315


Overview:

	The CAPTCHA component for ASP.NET provided by Lanap may be
	completely bypassed, thus undermining the security benefit
	of the CAPTCHA technology.


Details:

	During a consulting engagement, Symantec identified that the
	Lanap CAPTCHA component stores the UUID and hash for a given
	CAPTCHA within the page ViewState. By replaying the ViewState
	for a known number, a remote attacker may avoid the CAPTCHA
	entirely.

	This behaviour is dependent on the way in which the Lanap
	component is integrated, however numerous examples including
	Lanap's demo code are identified as exhibiting this behaviour.


Vendor Response:

	The above vulnerability has been fixed in the latest release
	of the product, BotDetect ASP.NET CAPTCHA 1.5.4.0.

	Licensed and evaluation versions of Lanap BotDetect ASP.NET
	CAPTCHA	are available for customer download from the Lanap
	website at http://www.lanapsoft.com

	If there are any further questions about this statement, please
	contact Lanap support.

Recommendation:

	Upgrade to the latest release of the product,
	BotDetect ASP.NET CAPTCHA 1.5.4.0.
