Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0032

Package names:	   kernel, postgresql
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-06-05
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system: memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.

  postgresql 
  PostgreSQL is an advanced Object-Relational database management system
  (DBMS) that supports almost all SQL constructs (including transactions,
  subselects and user-defined types and functions). The postgresql package
  includes the client programs and libraries that you'll need to access a
  PostgreSQL DBMS server. These PostgreSQL client programs are programs
  that directly manipulate the internal structure of PostgreSQL databases
  on a PostgreSQL server. These client programs can be located on the same
  machine with the PostgreSQL server, or may be on a remote machine which
  accesses a PostgreSQL server over a network connection. This package 
  contains the docs in HTML for the whole package, as well as command-line
  utilities for managing PostgreSQL databases on a PostgreSQL server.

Problem description:
  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Pavel Kankovsky discovered that the getsockopt()
    function, when called with an SO_ORIGINAL_DST argument, does not
    properly clear the returned structure, so that a random piece of
    kernel memory is exposed to the user. This could potentially
    reveal sensitive data like passwords or encryption keys.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2006-1343 to this issue.

  postgresql < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 > 
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Akio Ishida and Yasuo Ohgaki have reported vulnerabilities
    in PostgreSQL, which potentially can be exploited by malicious people
    to conduct SQL injection attacks.
  - The first issue is due to an input validation error when handling a
    parameter containing invalidly-encoded multibyte characters, which
    could be exploited by malicious people to bypass standard string-escaping
    methods and conduct SQL injection attacks via a supposedly secure script.
  - The second issue is due to an error when escaping ASCII single quote "'"
    characters (by turning them into "\'") and operating in multibyte
    encodings that allow using the "0x5c" ASCII code (backslash) as the
    trailing byte of a multibyte character, which could be exploited by
    attackers to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-2313 and CVE-2006-2314 to these issues.
