Synopsis
========

SpamAssassin, when running with certain options, could allow local or
even remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands, possibly as the
root user.

Background
==========

SpamAssassin is an extensible email filter used to identify junk email.
spamd is the daemonized version of SpamAssassin.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-filter/spamassassin       < 3.1.3                   >= 3.1.3

Description
===========

When spamd is run with both the "--vpopmail" (-v) and "--paranoid" (-P)
options, it is vulnerable to an unspecified issue.

Impact
======

With certain configuration options, a local or even remote attacker
could execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running spamd,
which is root by default, by sending a crafted message to the spamd
daemon. Furthermore, the attack can be remotely performed if the
"--allowed-ips" (-A) option is present and specifies non-local
adresses. Note that Gentoo Linux is not vulnerable in the default
configuration.

Workaround
==========

Don't use both the "--paranoid" (-P) and the "--vpopmail" (-v) options.

Resolution
==========

All SpamAssassin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-filter/spamassassin-3.1.3"
