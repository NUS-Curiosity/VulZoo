Synopsis
========

Vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox allow privilege escalations for
JavaScript code, cross site scripting attacks, HTTP response smuggling
and possibly the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Mozilla Firefox is the next-generation web browser from the Mozilla
project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                         /  Vulnerable  /       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla-firefox          < 1.5.0.4          >= 1.5.0.4
  2  www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin      < 1.5.0.4          >= 1.5.0.4
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

A number of vulnerabilities were found and fixed in Mozilla Firefox.
For details please consult the references below.

Impact
======

By enticing the user to visit a malicious website, a remote attacker
can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript Code into the user's browser,
execute JavaScript code with elevated privileges and possibly execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.4"

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.4"

Note: There is no stable fixed version for the Alpha architecture yet.
Users of Mozilla Firefox on Alpha should consider unmerging it until
such a version is available.
