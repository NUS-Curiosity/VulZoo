Synopsis
========

AWStats contains a bug in the sanitization of the input parameters
which can lead to the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

AWStats is an advanced log file analyzer and statistics generator.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-www/awstats      < 6.5-r1                           >= 6.5-r1

Description
===========

Hendrik Weimer has found that if updating the statistics via the web
frontend is enabled, it is possible to inject arbitrary code via a pipe
character in the "migrate" parameter. Additionally, r0t has discovered
that AWStats fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in
awstats.pl.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server in the
context of the application running the AWStats CGI script if updating
of the statistics via web frontend is allowed. Nonetheless, all
configurations are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
awstats.pl, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary scripts
running in the context of the victim's browser.

Workaround
==========

Disable statistics updates using the web frontend to avoid code
injection. However, there is no known workaround at this time
concerning the cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Resolution
==========

All AWStats users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/awstats-6.5-r1"
