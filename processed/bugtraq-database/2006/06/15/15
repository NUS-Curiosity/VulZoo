Synopsis
========

The OpenLDAP replication server slurpd contains a buffer overflow that
could result in arbitrary code execution.

Background
==========

OpenLDAP is a suite of LDAP-related applications and development tools.
It includes slapd (the standalone LDAP server), slurpd (the standalone
LDAP replication server), various LDAP libraries, utilities and example
clients.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-nsd/openldap      < 2.3.22                          >= 2.3.22

Description
===========

slurpd contains a buffer overflow when reading very long hostnames from
the status file.

Impact
======

By injecting an overly long hostname in the status file, an attacker
could possibly cause the execution of arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running slurpd.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All openLDAP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-nds/openldap-2.3.22"
