Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0042

Package names:	   gnupg, kernel, samba
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-07-21
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2
 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  gnupg
  GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because it does not
  use IDEA it can be used without any restrictions. GnuPG is in compliance
  with the OpenPGP specification (RFC2440).

  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process 
  allocation, device input and output, etc.

  samba
  Samba provides an SMB server which can be used to provide network
  services to SMB (sometimes called "Lan Manager") clients, including
  various versions of MS Windows, OS/2, and other Linux machines. Samba
  uses NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) protocols and does NOT need NetBEUI
  (Microsoft Raw NetBIOS frame) protocol.

Problem description:
  gnupg < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in GnuPG, cause due
    to an input validation error within "parse-packet.c" when handling
    the length of a message packet. This can be exploited to cause gpg
    to consume large amount of memory or crash via an overly large packet
    length in a message packet. This can be further exploited to cause an
    integer overflow which leads to a possible memory corruption that
    crashes gpg.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-3082 to this issue.

  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - New upstream.
  - Upgraded 3ware 9xxx RAID driver, Bug #1823.
  - SECURITY FIX: A vulnerability has been reported in the Linux kernel,
    which can be exploited by malicious, local users to gain escalated
    privileges. The vulnerability is caused due to a race condition in
    "/proc" when changing file status. Successful exploitation allows
    execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2006-3626 to this issue.
  
  samba < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in Samba, caused due
    to an error when handling a lot of share connection requests. This
    can be exploited to cause smbd to exhaust memory resources via a
    large number of share connections.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2006-3403 to this issue.
