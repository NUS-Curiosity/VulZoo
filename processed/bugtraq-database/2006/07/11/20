-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office. Exploitation requires
that the attacker coerce the target into opening a malicious .XLS
file.

The specific flaw exists within the rebuilding of malformed cell
comments. When Excel encounters a malformed record it attempts to
rebuild the broken meta-data. A flaw in this rebuilding process allows
the user to specify critical data offsets eventually leading to code
execution with the credentials of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
