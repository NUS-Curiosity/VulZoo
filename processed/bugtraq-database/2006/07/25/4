Synopsis
========

Wireshark (formerly known as Ethereal) is vulnerable to several
security issues, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code
by a remote attacker.

Background
==========

Wireshark, formerly known as Ethereal, is a popular network protocol
analyzer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /   Vulnerable   /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/wireshark       < 0.99.2                   >= 0.99.2
  2  net-analyzer/ethereal      <= 0.99.0-r1               Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Wireshark dissectors have been found vulnerable to a large number of
exploits, including off-by-one errors, buffer overflows, format string
overflows and an infinite loop.

Impact
======

Running an affected version of Wireshark or Ethereal could allow for a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's computer by
sending specially crafted packets.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.2"

All Ethereal users should migrate to Wireshark:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --unmerge net-analyzer/ethereal
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-0.99.2"

To keep the [saved] configuration from Ethereal and reuse it with
Wireshark:

    # mv ~/.ethereal ~/.wireshark
