Synopsis
========

OpenOffice.org is affected by three security vulnerabilities which can
be exploited to allow the execution of arbitrary code by a remote
attacker.

Background
==========

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                    /  Vulnerable  /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/openoffice           < 2.0.3                  >= 2.0.3
  2  app-office/openoffice-bin       < 2.0.3                  >= 2.0.3
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Internal security audits by OpenOffice.org have discovered three
security vulnerabilities related to Java applets, macros and the XML
file format parser.

* Specially crafted Java applets can break through the "sandbox".

* Specially crafted macros make it possible to inject BASIC code into
  documents which is executed when the document is loaded.

* Loading a malformed XML file can cause a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities to escape the Java
sandbox, execute arbitrary code or BASIC code with the permissions of
the user running OpenOffice.org.

Workaround
==========

Disabling Java applets will protect against the vulnerability in the
handling of Java applets. There are no workarounds for the macro and
file format vulnerabilities.

Resolution
==========

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.0.3"
