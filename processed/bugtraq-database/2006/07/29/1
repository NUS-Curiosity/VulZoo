    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-538

Description:
    Previous versions of the httpd package contain a vulnerability in
    the mod_rewrite module. In some configurations, this vulnerability
    provides a remote attacker an opportunity to run arbitrary code as
    the httpd user. The default configuration of the httpd package
    is not not vulnerable to this attack because it does not provide
    any mod_rewrite rules that would enable the vulnerability.
