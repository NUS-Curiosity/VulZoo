Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in TunePimp has been reported which could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The TunePimp library (also referred to as libtunepimp) is a development
library geared towards developers who wish to create MusicBrainz
enabled tagging applications.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/tunepimp      <= 0.4.2                     Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Kevin Kofler has reported a vulnerability where three stack variables
are allocated with 255, 255 and 100 bytes respectively, yet 256 bytes
are read into each. This could lead to buffer overflows.

Impact
======

Running an affected version of TunePimp could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code by a remote attacker.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

TunePimp has been masked in Portage pending the resolution of these
issues. TunePimp users are advised to uninstall the package until
further notice:

    # emerge --ask --unmerge "media-libs/tunepimp"
