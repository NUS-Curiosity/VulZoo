Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.21.06: Novell eDirectory evtFilteredMonitorEventsRequest
 Invalid Free Vulnerability

Novell eDirectory evtFilteredMonitorEventsRequest Invalid Free Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 10.21.06
http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 21, 2006

I. BACKGROUND

Novell eDirectory is a cross-platform lightweight directory access
protocol (LDAP) server. More information can be found on Novell's web
site at http://www.novell.com/products/edirectory/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an invalid free vulnerability in Novell Inc.'s
eDirectory product could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in
the context of the running daemon.

The evtFilteredMonitorEventsRequest function takes an array of objects
that contain an allocated string and two integer values. When an
attacker supplies less objects than is specified by the number of
objects to be sent, an invalid free condition arises. Due to the cleanup
loop being bound by the number supplied within the request rather than
the number actually processed, the free() function will be called on
values on the heap which are outside of the bounds of the allocated
array.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
crash the server or execute arbitrary code. No credentials are required.
Typically this daemon runs with administrator privileges.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in version
8.8.1 of Novell Inc.'s eDirectory server. Version 8.8 was also tested
and found to be vulnerable. Earlier versions are suspected to be
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

It is possible to disable the LDAP service from running via the
ndsmodules.conf file which is usually located in
/etc/opt/novell/eDirectory/conf. However, doing so greatly reduces the
functionality of this program.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Novell has addressed this vulnerability with eDirectory 8.8.1 FTF1.
