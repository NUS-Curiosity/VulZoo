Synopsis
========

Multiple buffer overflows have been found in libmusicbrainz, which
could lead to a Denial of Service or possibly the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libmusicbrainz is a client library used to access MusicBrainz music
meta data.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1  media-libs/musicbrainz       < 2.1.4                     >= 2.1.4

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma reported a possible buffer overflow in the
MBHttp::Download function of lib/http.cpp as well as several possible
buffer overflows in lib/rdfparse.c.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could be able to execute arbitrary code or cause
Denial of Service by making use of an overly long "Location" header in
an HTTP redirect message from a malicious server or a long URL in
malicious RDF feeds.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libmusicbrainz users should upgrade to the latest version:

     # emerge --sync
     # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/musicbrainz-2.1.4"
