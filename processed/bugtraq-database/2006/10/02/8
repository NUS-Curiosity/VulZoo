Description:
  According to a vendor security advisory [0], multiple vulnerabilities
  exist in the Secure Shell (SSH) implementation OpenSSH [1]:

  First, a pre-authentication denial of service was found by Tavis
  Ormandy that would cause sshd(8) to spin until the login grace time
  expired. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project
  assigned the ids CVE-2006-4924 [2] and CVE-2006-4925 [3] to the
  problem.

  Second, an unsafe signal handler, reported by Mark Dowd, was fixed.
  The signal handler was vulnerable to a race condition that could be
  exploited to perform a pre-authentication denial of service. This
  vulnerability could theoretically lead to pre-authentication remote
  code execution if some authentication methods like GSSAPI are enabled,
  but the likelihood of successful exploitation appears remote. The
  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project assigned the id
  CVE-2006-5051 [4] to the problem.
