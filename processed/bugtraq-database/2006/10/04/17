Synopsis
========

Multiple input validation errors have been identified that allow
arbitrary code execution on a user's system via the handling of
malicious Flash files.

Background
==========

The Adobe Flash Player is a renderer for Flash files - commonly used to
provide interactive websites, digital experiences and mobile content.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1  net-www/netscape-flash      < 7.0.68                    >= 7.0.68

Description
===========

The Adobe Flash Player contains multiple unspecified vulnerabilities.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to view a malicious Flash file and
execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the player.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Flash Player users should upgrade to the latest version:

     # emerge --sync
     # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-www/netscape-flash-7.0.68"
