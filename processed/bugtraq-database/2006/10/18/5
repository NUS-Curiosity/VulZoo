Synopsis
========

NSS fails to properly validate PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures.

Background
==========

The Mozilla Network Security Service is a library implementing security
features like SSL v.2/v.3, TLS, PKCS #5, PKCS #7, PKCS #11, PKCS #12,
S/MIME and X.509 certificates.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/nss      < 3.11.3                              >= 3.11.3

Description
===========

Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered that it might be possible to forge
signatures signed by RSA keys with the exponent of 3. This affects a
number of RSA signature implementations, including Mozilla's NSS.

Impact
======

Since several Certificate Authorities (CAs) are using an exponent of 3
it might be possible for an attacker to create a key with a false CA
signature. This impacts any software using the NSS library, like the
Mozilla products Firefox, Thunderbird and Seamonkey.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All NSS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/nss-3.11.3"

Note: As usual after updating a library, you should run
'revdep-rebuild' (from the app-portage/gentoolkit package) to ensure
that all applications linked to it are properly rebuilt.
