Synopsis
========

Cscope is vulnerable to multiple buffer overflows that could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Cscope is a developer's tool for browsing source code.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /     Vulnerable     /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-util/cscope      < 15.5.20060927             >= 15.5.20060927

Description
===========

Unchecked use of strcpy() and *scanf() leads to several buffer
overflows.

Impact
======

A user could be enticed to open a carefully crafted file which would
allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user running Cscope.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cscope users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-util/cscope-15.5.20060927"
