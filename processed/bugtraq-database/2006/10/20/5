Subject: [CAID 34693, 34694]: CA BrightStor ARCserve Backup Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities (UPDATED)


Our original fixes for the BrightStor ARCserve Backup 
vulnerabilities that we publicly disclosed on 2006-10-05 
(http://www3.ca.com/securityadvisor/blogs/posting.aspx?id=90744&pid=93775&date=2006/10) 
did not completely resolve one of the vulnerabilities. 
Consequently, we have released new fixes that need to be applied. 
Please note that these do not replace the original fixes. Both 
fixes (each release needs two fixes) need to be applied. A revised 
advisory can be found below, and at this link.
