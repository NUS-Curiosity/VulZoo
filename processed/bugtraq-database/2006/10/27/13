Synopsis
========

Cheese Tracker contains a buffer overflow allowing the remote execution
of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Cheese Tracker is a Qt-based portable Impulse Tracker clone, a music
tracker for the CT, IT, XM and S3M file formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                    /  Vulnerable  /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/cheesetracker     < 0.9.9-r1              >= 0.9.9-r1

Description
===========

Luigi Auriemma reported that the XM loader of Cheese Tracker contains a
buffer overflow vulnerability in the
loader_XM::load_intrument_internal() function from
loaders/loader_xm.cpp.

Impact
======

An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user
running Cheese Tracker by enticing a user to load a crafted file with
large amount of extra data.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Cheese Tracker users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/cheesetracker-0.9.9-r1"
