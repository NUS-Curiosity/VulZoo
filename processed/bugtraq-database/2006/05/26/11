Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0030

Package names:	   kernel, quagga 
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-05-26
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 3.0

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.

  quagga 
  Quagga is a free software that manages TCP/IP based routing protocol.
  It takes multi-server and multi-thread approach to resolve the current
  complexity of the Internet. 

Problem description:
  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: A race condition in the "do_add_counters()" function
    in netfilter can be exploited by local users to read kernel memory
    or cause the system to crash via a race condition that produces a
    size value that is different from the size of the allocated memory.
  - An input validation error in SCTP when processing a HB-ACK chunk
    with a specially-crafted parameter length can be exploited to cause
    out-of-bounds memory access. This can potentially cause the system
    to crash.
  - An error in SCTP chunk length calculation during parameter
    processing can be exploited to cause out-of-bounds memory access.
    This can potentially cause the system to crash.
  - A vulnerability has been reported which is caused due to some errors
    within the "snmp_trap_decode()" function when handling certain SNMP
    packets. This can be exploited to cause memory corruption due to
    incorrect freeing of memory, which can potentially cause the system
    to crash.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2006-0039, CVE-2006-1857, CVE-2006-1858
    and CVE-2006-2444 to these issue.

  quagga < TSL 3.0 > 
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: Konstantin V. Gavrilenko has reported two security
    issues in Quagga, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass
    certain security restrictions and to disclose system information.
  - An error in RIPd does not properly implement configurations that 
    1) disable RIPv1 or 2) require plaintext or MD5 authentication. This allows
    remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via REQUEST packets
    such as SEND UPDATE.
  - An error in RIPd does not properly enforce RIPv2 authentication
    requirements. This allows remote attackers to modify routing state via
    RIPv1 RESPONSE packets.
  - Fredrik Widell has reported a vulnerability in Quagga caused due to an
    infinite loop error in bgpd within the "community_str2com()" function.
    This can be exploited to cause the process to consume large amounts of
    CPU resources by issuing the "sh ip bgp command" command via the telnet
    management interface.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-2223, CVE-2006-2224 and CVE-2006-2276 to
    these issues.
