Synopsis
========

A MySQL server may leak information to unauthorized users.

Background
==========

MySQL is a popular multi-threaded, multi-user SQL database server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/mysql      < 4.1.19                              >= 4.1.19

Description
===========

The processing of the COM_TABLE_DUMP command by a MySQL server fails to
properly validate packets that arrive from the client via a network
socket.

Impact
======

By crafting specific malicious packets an attacker could gather
confidential information from the memory of a MySQL server process, for
example results of queries by other users or applications. By using PHP
code injection or similar techniques it would be possible to exploit
this flaw through web applications that use MySQL as a database
backend.

Note that on 5.x versions it is possible to overwrite the stack and
execute arbitrary code with this technique. Users of MySQL 5.x are
urged to upgrade to the latest available version.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MySQL users should upgrade to the latest version.

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/mysql-4.1.19"
