Synopsis
========

Nagios is vulnerable to a buffer overflow which may lead to remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Nagios is an open source host, service and network monitoring program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/nagios-core        < 1.4                      >= 1.4

Description
===========

Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE security team discovered a buffer
overflow vulnerability in the handling of a negative HTTP
Content-Length header.

Impact
======

A buffer overflow in Nagios CGI scripts under certain web servers
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a negative
content length HTTP header.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Nagios users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/nagios-core-1.4"
