    Local Non-deterministic Information Exposure

    http://bugs.rpath.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1182

Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package have a small information leak
    that exposes 6 bytes of arbitrary kernel memory when the getsockopt
    system call is called with the SO_ORIGINAL_DST argument.  An attacking
    program cannot choose which 6 bytes of memory are exposed.
