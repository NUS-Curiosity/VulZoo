Synopsis:          Updated fetchmail packages fix security issues
Advisory ID:       FLSA:164512
Issue date:        2006-05-12
Product:           Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core
Keywords:          Bugfix
CVE Names:         CVE-2003-0792 CVE-2005-2335 CVE-2005-3088

1. Topic:

Updated fetchmail packages that fix security flaws are now available.

Fetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility.

2. Relevant releases/architectures:

Red Hat Linux 7.3 - i386
Red Hat Linux 9 - i386
Fedora Core 1 - i386
Fedora Core 2 - i386

3. Problem description:

A bug was found in the way fetchmail allocates memory for long lines. A
remote attacker could cause a denial of service by sending a specially-
crafted email. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has
assigned the name CVE-2003-0792 to this issue.

A buffer overflow was discovered in fetchmail's POP3 client. A malicious
server could cause send a carefully crafted message UID and cause
fetchmail to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code as the user
running fetchmail. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
assigned the name CVE-2005-2335 to this issue.

A bug was found in the way the fetchmailconf utility program writes
configuration files. The default behavior of fetchmailconf is to write a
configuration file which may be world readable for a short period of
time. This configuration file could provide passwords to a local
malicious attacker within the short window before fetchmailconf sets
secure permissions. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has
assigned the name CVE-2005-3088 to this issue.

A bug was found when fetchmail is running in multidrop mode. A malicious
mail server can cause a denial of service by sending a message without
headers. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned
the name CVE-2005-4348 to this issue.

Users of fetchmail should update to this erratum package which contains
backported patches to correct these issues.

4. Solution:

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

To update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:

rpm -Fvh [filenames]

where [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those
RPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which
are not installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note
that you can also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only*
contains the desired RPMs.

Please note that this update is also available via yum and apt.  Many
people find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use yum issue:

yum update

or to use apt:

apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

This will start an interactive process that will result in the
appropriate RPMs being upgraded on your system.  This assumes that you
have yum or apt-get configured for obtaining Fedora Legacy content.
Please visit http://www.fedoralegacy.org/docs for directions on how to
configure yum and apt-get.
