Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in libTIFF could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/tiff       < 3.8.1                            >= 3.8.1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities, ranging from integer overflows and NULL
pointer dereferences to double frees, were reported in libTIFF.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by enticing a user to
open a specially crafted TIFF image, possibly leading to the execution
of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.8.1"
