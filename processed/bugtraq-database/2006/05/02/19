Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in the XRender extension potentially allows any X.Org
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

Background
==========

X.Org is X.Org Foundation's public implementation of the X Window
System.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-base/xorg-x11     < 6.8.2-r7                      >= 6.8.2-r7

Description
===========

X.Org miscalculates the size of a buffer in the XRender extension.

Impact
======

An X.Org user could exploit this issue to make the X server execute
arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All X.Org users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-base/xorg-x11-6.8.2-r7"
