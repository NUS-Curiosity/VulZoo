Description
===========

Xfocus Team discovered multiple integer overflows that may lead to a
heap-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to play a specially crafted multimedia
file, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0.20060415"
