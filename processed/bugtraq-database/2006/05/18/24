Thanks for this useful clarification.  After reading through all the
docs you link, I've come up with a table of patch relevance that I
_think_ covers it :

[fixed width font required ...]

              | CVE-2006-0034                | CVE-2006-1184
--------------+------------------------------+--------------------
WinNT         | system compromise, no patch  | DoS, no patch
Win2K/SP2,SP3 | system compromise, no patch  | DoS, no patch
Win2K/SP4     | DoS, MS05-051 fixes [1]      | DoS, MS06-018 fixes
WinXP/SP1     | DoS, MS05-051 fixes [1]      | DoS, MS06-018 fixes
WinXP/SP2     | immune                       | DoS, MS06-018 fixes
Win2003       |  [2]                         | DoS, MS06-018 fixes

[1] MS05-051 is now replaced by MS06-018
[2] eEye says Win2003 immune / MS says fixed by MS06-018 ???

If that's right, then for the Windows versions still in support the
vulnerabilities are all DoS, so the Microsoft patch download page
severity statements are wrong (typos ?), albeit that non-public
patches are available via special support channels which _do_ fix
system compromise problems for NT and Win2K SP3/4.

Good question - hopefully not applicable here :-} .....
.... Except that Maxime Duchamp wrote :

Well that's disquieting.  I have no info to add here myself - but
noticing the silence in this thread from the major players, I wonder
whether more "research" is going on as we speak.

Thanks to all.
