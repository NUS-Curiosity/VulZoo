-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell eDirectory. Exploitation does not
require authentication.

interface on TCP port 8030. During the parsing of long URIs to the
'nds' path a trivially exploitable stack-based buffer overflow occurs.

Novell has addressed this issue in the latest version of eDirectory
iMonitor. More information is available from:
