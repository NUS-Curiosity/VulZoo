Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0024

Package names:	   clamav, cyrus-sasl, kernel, libtiff, rsync, xorg-x11
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-05-05
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  clamav
  Clam AntiVirus is a GPL anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. The main purpose of
  this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment scanning).
  The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a 
  command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via Internet.
  The programs are based on a shared library distributed with package,
  which you can use with your own software.

  cyrus-sasl
  The cyrus-sasl package contains the Cyrus implementation of SASL.
  SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
  adding authentication support to connection-based protocols.

  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.

  libtiff
  The libtiff package contains a library of functions for manipulating
  TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format files.  TIFF is a widely
  used file format for bitmapped images.  TIFF files usually end in the
  .tif extension and they are often quite large.

  rsync
  Rsync uses a quick and reliable algorithm to very quickly bring
  remote and host files into sync.  Rsync is fast because it just
  sends the differences in the files over the network (instead of
  sending the complete files). Rsync is often used as a very powerful
  mirroring process or just as a more capable replacement for the
  rcp command.  A technical report which describes the rsync algorithm
  is included in this package.

  xorg-x11
  X.org X11 is an open source implementation of the X Window System.  It
  provides the basic low level functionality which full fledged
  graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as GNOME and KDE are designed
  upon.

Problem description:
  clamav < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in ClamAV caused due to
    a boundary error within the HTTP client in the Freshclam command line
    utility. This can be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow
    when the HTTP headers received from a web server exceeds 8KB.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-1989 this issue.

  
  cyrus-sasl < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Mu Security has reported a vulnerability in Cyrus SASL
    library, which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS.
    The vulnerability is caused due to an unspecified error during
    DIGEST-MD5 negotiation.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-1721 this issue.

  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in Linux Kernel, which
    can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS (Denial of Service).
    The vulnerability is caused due to missing checks on SCTP chunk sizes
    in the SCTP-netfilter code and may result in an infinite loop exhausting
    system resources.
  - Directory traversal vulnerability in CIFS which allows local users to 
    escape chroot restrictions for an SMB-mounted filesystem via "..\\" 
    sequences.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-1527 and CVE-2006-1863 to these issues.

  libtiff < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Tavis Ormandy has reported some vulnerabilities in LibTIFF,
    which can be exploited by malicious people to cause a DoS and potentially
    to compromise a user's system.
  - Several unspecified errors in the "TIFFFetchAnyArray()" function and in
    the cleanup functions can be exploited to crash an application linked
    against LibTIFF when a specially crafted TIFF image is processed.
  - Integer overflow in the TIFFFetchData function in tif_dirread.c allows
    context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly
    execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image.
  - A double free error in tif_jpeg.c within the setfield/getfield methods
    in the cleanup functions can be exploited to crash an application linked
    against LibTIFF and may allow arbitrary code execution when a specially
    crafted TIFF image is processed.
  - The TIFFToRGB function in libtiff allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash) via a crafted TIFF image with Yr/Yg/Yb values
    that exceed the YCR/YCG/YCB values, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-2024, CVE-2006-2025, CVE-2006-2026 and
    CVE-2006-2120 these issues.

  rsync < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - New Upstream.
  - SECURITY Fix: A vulnerability has been reported in rsync caused due to
    an integer overflow error in the "receive_xattr()" function within the
    xattrs.diff patch. This can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow and
    may allow arbitrary code execution via specially crafted extended
    attributes.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-2083 this issue.

  xorg-x11 < TSL 3.0 >
  - SECURITY Fix: A buffer overflow in the XRender extension allows any
    X.Org user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. A typo
    causes the code to mis-compute the size of memory allocations in the
    XRenderCompositeTriStrip and XRenderCompositeTriFan requests.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-1526 this issue.
