-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Citrix MetaFrame Presentation Server.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the routine IMA_SECURE_DecryptData1()
defined in ImaSystem.dll and is reachable through the Independant
Management Architecture (IMA) service (ImaSrv.exe) that listens on TCP
port 2512 or 2513. The encryption scheme used is reversible and relies
on several 32-bit fields indicating the size of the packet and the
offsets to the authentication strings. During the decryption of
authentication data an attacker can specify invalid sizes that result
in an exploitable heap corruption.

-- Vendor Response:
Citrix has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
