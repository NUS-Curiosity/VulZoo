Synopsis
========

The NVIDIA binary graphics driver is vulnerable to a local privilege
escalation through an X session.

Background
==========

The NVIDIA binary graphics driver from NVIDIA Corporation provides the
kernel module and the GL modules for graphic acceleration on the NVIDIA
based graphic cards.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                     /  Vulnerable  /           Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers     < 1.0.8776             >= 1.0.8776
                                                            < 1.0-8762

Description
===========

Rapid7 reported a boundary error in the NVIDIA binary graphics driver
that leads to a buffer overflow in the accelerated rendering
functionality.

Impact
======

An X client could trigger the buffer overflow with a maliciously
crafted series of glyphs. A remote attacker could also entice a user to
open a specially crafted web page, document or X client that will
trigger the buffer overflow. This could result in the execution of
arbitrary code with root privileges or at least in the crash of the X
server.

Workaround
==========

Disable the accelerated rendering functionality in the Device section
of xorg.conf :
    Option      "RenderAccel" "false"

Resolution
==========

NVIDIA binary graphics driver users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers-1.0.8776"
