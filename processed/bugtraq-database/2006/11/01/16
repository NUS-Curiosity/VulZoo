Description:
    In previous versions of the wireshark and tshark packages, and all
    versions of the ethereal and tethereal packages, are vulnerable to
    several remote Denial of Service attacks which can cause the
    application to crash.  None of these vulnerabilities is currently
    believed to enable remote unauthorized access.
    
    The fixes are available only as part of the wireshark package.
    Development of the ethereal program has ceased under the ethereal
    name and continued under the wireshark name, due to restrictions
    on the use of the "ethereal" trademark.  The latest version of the
    ethereal and tethereal packages in rPath Linux 1 are now redirects
    to the wireshark and tshark packages.  The command "conary update
    ethereal tethereal" will cause the ethereal and tethereal packages
    on the system to be replaced by wireshark and tshark, respectively.
    The "conary updateall" command will also appropriately migrate the
    system from ethereal to wireshark.
