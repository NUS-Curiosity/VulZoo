Synopsis
========

qmailAdmin is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could lead to the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

qmailAdmin is a free software package that provides a web interface for
managing a qmail system with virtual domains.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-mail/qmailadmin      < 1.2.10                       >= 1.2.10

Description
===========

qmailAdmin fails to properly handle the "PATH_INFO" variable in
qmailadmin.c. The PATH_INFO is a standard CGI environment variable
filled with user supplied data.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
qmailAdmin a maliciously crafted URL that could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running qmailAdmin.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All qmailAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-mail/qmailadmin-1.2.10"
