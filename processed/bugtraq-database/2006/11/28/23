Synopsis
========

A flaw in OpenLDAP allows remote unauthenticated attackers to cause a
Denial of Service.

Background
==========

OpenLDAP is a suite of LDAP-related applications and development tools.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-nds/openldap      < 2.3.27-r3                    >= 2.3.27-r3
                                                         *>= 2.2.28-r5
                                                         *>= 2.1.30-r8

Description
===========

Evgeny Legerov has discovered that the truncation of an incoming
authcid longer than 255 characters and ending with a space as the 255th
character will lead to an improperly computed name length. This will
trigger an assert in the libldap code.

Impact
======

By sending a BIND request with a specially crafted authcid parameter to
an OpenLDAP service, a remote attacker can cause the service to crash.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenLDAP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "net-nds/openldap"
