Synopsis
========

A flaw in fvwm-menu-directory may permit a local attacker to execute
arbitrary commands with the privileges of another user.

Background
==========

fvwm is a highly configurable virtual window manager for X11 desktops.
fvwm-menu-directory allows fvwm users to browse directories from within
fvwm.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /   Vulnerable   /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-wm/fvwm      < 2.5.18-r1                         >= 2.5.18-r1

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered that
fvwm-menu-directory does not sufficiently sanitise directory names
prior to generating menus.

Impact
======

A local attacker who can convince an fvwm-menu-directory user to browse
a directory they control could cause fvwm commands to be executed with
the privileges of the fvwm user. Fvwm commands can be used to execute
arbitrary shell commands.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All fvwm users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-wm/fvwm-2.5.18-r1"

==========
