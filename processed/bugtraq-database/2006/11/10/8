Synopsis
========

An incorrect seteuid() call could allow an FTP user to access some
files or directories that would normally be inaccessible.

Background
==========

net-ftp/ftpd is the Linux Netkit FTP server with optional SSL support.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-ftp/ftpd      < 0.17-r4                            >= 0.17-r4

Description
===========

Paul Szabo reported that an incorrect seteuid() call after the chdir()
function can allow an attacker to access a normally forbidden
directory, in some very particular circumstances, for example when the
NFS-hosted targetted directory is not reachable by the client-side root
user. Additionally, some potentially exploitable unchecked setuid()
calls were also fixed.

Impact
======

A local attacker might craft his home directory to gain access through
ftpd to normally forbidden directories like /root, possibly with
writing permissions if seteuid() fails and if the ftpd configuration
allows that. The unchecked setuid() calls could also lead to a root FTP
login, depending on the FTP server configuration.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Netkit FTP Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-ftp/ftpd-0.17-r4"
