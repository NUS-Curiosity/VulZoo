Reference:  http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/20879/

Authentication Required Yes (to network)
Exploit publicly available No

Overview
Symantec has released an update to address a security concern in PHP, a commonly used HTML-embedded scripting language, for Symantec's Veritas NetBackup  6.0 PureDisk Remote Office Edition. A heap overflow has been reported in the version of PHP shipped with the affected product builds listed below.  The  management interface of Symantec's product is accessible only through an SSL connection by default.  Depending on configuration, however; an unauthorized user  could potentially attempt to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable server, which runs in non-privileged mode by default. 

Affected Product/Version
Product Version  Build  Solution(s)
Symantec Veritas NetBackup PureDisk Remote Office Edition (all platforms)
6.0GA, MP1 NB_PDE_60_MP1_S01

Not Affected
Symantec Veritas NetBackup PureDisk Remote Office Edition (all platforms)
6.1

Symantec Response
Symantec engineers have addressed the reported issue and provided Security updates. Symantec strongly recommends all customers apply the latest security update  identified above or upgrade to Symantec Veritas NetBackup PureDisk Remote Office Edition 6.1 to protect against threats of this nature. 
Symantec knows of no exploitation of or adverse customer impact from this issue. 

The patch is available from: http://support.veritas.com/docs/285984 for Symantec Veritas NetBackup PureDisk Remote Office Edition 6.0. 

Best Practices
As part of normal best practices, Symantec recommends: 
* Restrict access to administration or management systems to authorized privileged users only 
* Block remote access to all ports not essential for efficient operation 
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only 
* Remove/disable unnecessary accounts or restrict access according to security policy as required 
* Run under the principle of least privilege where possible 
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches 
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and antivirus applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of detection and protection to both  inbound and outbound threats 
* Deploy network intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious  activity related to exploitation of latest vulnerabilities
