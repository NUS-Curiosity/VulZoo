-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Netmail. Exploitation does not
require authentication.

The specific flaw exists within the user authentication component of
Novell Netmail. The routine responsible for authenticating Netmail
users lacks adequate bounds checking when processing a username
containing one or more period (.) characters. The affected code is
reused by several Netmail services including SMTP, POP, IMAP, HTTP and
the proprietary NMAP. Each of these services is vulnerable to an
exploitable stack-based buffer overflow.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
