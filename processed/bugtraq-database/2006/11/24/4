Synopsis
========

Multiple buffer overflows have been reported in TIN, possibly leading
to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

TIN is a threaded NNTP and spool based UseNet newsreader for a variety
of platforms.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-nntp/tin       < 1.8.2                               >= 1.8.2

Description
===========

Urs Janssen and Aleksey Salow have reported multiple buffer overflows
in TIN. Additionally, the OpenPKG project has reported an allocation
off-by-one flaw which can lead to a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a TIN user to read a specially crafted news
article, and execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
TIN.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All TIN users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-nntp/tin-1.8.2"
