1. Summary:

Updated package addresses several security issues.

2. Relevant releases:

VMware ESX 2.0.2 prior to upgrade patch 2

3. Problem description:

This patch addresses the following security issues:

Openssh -- A bug was found in the way the OpenSSH server handled the
MaxStartups and LoginGraceTime configuration variables. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name
CAN-2004-2069 to this issue.

samba -- A denial of service bug was found in the way the smbd daemon
tracks active connections to shares. It was possible for a remote
attacker to cause the smbd daemon to consume a large amount of system
memory by sending carefully crafted smb requests. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name
CVE-2006-3403 to this issue.

Python -- An integer overflow flaw was found in Python's PCRE library
that could be triggered by a maliciously crafted regular expression. On
systems that accept arbitrary regular expressions from untrusted users,
this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the application using the library. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned the name CVE-2005-2491 to
this issue.

ucd-snmp -- A denial of service bug was found in the way ucd-snmp uses
network stream protocols. A remote attacker could send a ucd-snmp agent
a specially crafted packet which will cause the agent to crash. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) assigned
the name CAN-2005-2177 to this issue.

XFree86 -- An integer overflow flaw in the way the XFree86 server
processes PCF font files was discovered. A malicious authorized client
could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service (crash) or
potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the XFree86
server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
assigned the name CVE-2006-3467 to this issue.

A minor info leak in socket name handling in the network code
(CVE-2006-1342).
A minor info leak in socket option handling in the network code
(CVE-2006-1343).
A directory traversal vulnerability in smbfs that allowed a local user
to escape chroot restrictions for an SMB-mounted filesystem via "..\\"
sequences (CVE-2006-1864).
A flaw in the mprotect system call that allowed to give write permission
to a readonly attachment of shared memory (CVE-2006-2071).

NOTE: AMD processers were not supported in the VMware ESX 2.0.2 release
so CVE-2006-1056 is not applicable to this version of the product.

The non-security-related fixes are documented on the patch download page.
