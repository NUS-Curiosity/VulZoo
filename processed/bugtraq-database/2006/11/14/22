Synopsis
========

GraphicsMagick improperly handles PALM and DCM images, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

GraphicsMagick is a collection of tools and libraries which support
reading, writing, and manipulating images in many major formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/graphicsmagick     < 1.1.7-r3               >= 1.1.7-r3

Description
===========

M. Joonas Pihlaja has reported that a boundary error exists within the
ReadDCMImage() function of coders/dcm.c, causing the improper handling
of DCM images. Pihlaja also reported that there are several boundary
errors in the ReadPALMImage() function of coders/palm.c, similarly
causing the improper handling of PALM images.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted DCM or PALM
image with GraphicsMagick, and possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running GraphicsMagick.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GraphicsMagick users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/graphicsmagick-1.1.7-r3"
