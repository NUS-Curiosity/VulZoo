Synopsis
========

PEAR-Auth did not correctly verify data passed to the DB and LDAP
containers, thus allowing to inject false credentials to bypass the
authentication.

Background
==========

PEAR-Auth is a PEAR package that provides methods to create a PHP based
authentication system.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-php/PEAR-Auth       < 1.2.4                          >= 1.2.4

Description
===========

Matt Van Gundy discovered that PEAR-Auth did not correctly validate
data passed to the DB and LDAP containers.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could possibly exploit this vulnerability to bypass
the authentication mechanism by injecting specially crafted input to
the underlying storage containers.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PEAR-Auth users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-php/PEAR-Auth-1.2.4"
