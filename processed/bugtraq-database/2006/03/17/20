Synopsis
========

Crypt::CBC uses an insecure initialization vector, potentially
resulting in a weaker encryption.

Background
==========

Crypt::CBC is a Perl module to encrypt data using cipher block chaining
(CBC).

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-perl/crypt-cbc       < 2.17                           >= 2.17

Description
===========

Lincoln Stein discovered that Crypt::CBC fails to handle 16 bytes long
initializiation vectors correctly when running in the RandomIV mode,
resulting in a weaker encryption because the second part of every block
will always be encrypted with zeros if the blocksize of the cipher is
greater than 8 bytes.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit weak ciphertext produced by Crypt::CBC to
bypass certain security restrictions or to gain access to sensitive
data.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Crypt::CBC users should upgrade to the latest available version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-perl/crypt-cbc-2.17"

==========
