Synopsis

RealPlayer is vulnerable to a buffer overflow that could lead to remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

RealPlayer is a multimedia player capable of handling multiple
multimedia file formats.

Affected packages

Description
===========

RealPlayer is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing malicious
SWF files.

Impact

the application.

Workaround
