Synopsis
========

MPlayer is vulnerable to integer overflows in FFmpeg and ASF decoding
that could potentially result in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

MPlayer is a media player capable of handling multiple multimedia file
formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /    Vulnerable    /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/mplayer     < 1.0.20060217            >= 1.0.20060217

Description
===========

MPlayer makes use of the FFmpeg library, which is vulnerable to a heap
overflow in the avcodec_default_get_buffer() function discovered by
Simon Kilvington (see GLSA 200601-06). Furthermore, AFI Security
Research discovered two integer overflows in ASF file format decoding,
in the new_demux_packet() function from libmpdemux/demuxer.h and the
demux_asf_read_packet() function from libmpdemux/demux_asf.c.

Impact
======

An attacker could craft a malicious media file which, when opened using
MPlayer, would lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. This could result
in the execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running MPlayer.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0.20060217"
