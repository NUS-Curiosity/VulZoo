Synopsis
========

SquirrelMail is vulnerable to several cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities and IMAP command injection.

Background
==========

SquirrelMail is a webmail package written in PHP. It supports IMAP and
SMTP protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-client/squirrelmail       < 1.4.6                   >= 1.4.6

Description
===========

SquirrelMail does not validate the right_frame parameter in
webmail.php, possibly allowing frame replacement or cross-site
scripting (CVE-2006-0188). Martijn Brinkers and Scott Hughes discovered
that MagicHTML fails to handle certain input correctly, potentially
leading to cross-site scripting (only Internet Explorer,
CVE-2006-0195). Vicente Aguilera reported that the
sqimap_mailbox_select function did not strip newlines from the mailbox
or subject parameter, possibly allowing IMAP command injection
(CVE-2006-0377).

Impact
======

By exploiting the cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, an attacker can
execute arbitrary scripts running in the context of the victim's
browser. This could lead to a compromise of the user's webmail account,
cookie theft, etc. A remote attacker could exploit the IMAP command
injection to execute arbitrary IMAP commands on the configured IMAP
server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.6"

Note: Users with the vhosts USE flag set should manually use
webapp-config to finalize the update.
