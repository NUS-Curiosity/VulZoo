Synopsis
========

The wv library is vulnerable to multiple integer overflows which could
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

wv is a library for conversion of MS Word DOC and RTF files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/wv     < 1.2.3-r1                            >= 1.2.3-r1

Description
===========

The wv library fails to do proper arithmetic checks in multiple places,
possibly leading to integer overflows.

Impact
======

An attacker could craft a malicious file that, when handled with the wv
library, could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All wv library users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/wv-1.2.3-r1"
