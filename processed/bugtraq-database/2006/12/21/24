Subject Name:            Ruby
Subject Summary:         Programming Language
Subject Home:            http://www.ruby-lang.org/
Subject Versions:        * < 1.8.5-p2

Vulnerability Id:        CVE-2006-6303
Vulnerability Scope:     global (not OpenPKG specific)

Attack Feasibility:      run-time
Attack Vector:           remote network
Attack Impact:           denial of service

Description:
    As confirmed by the vendor [0], a Denial of Service (DoS)
    vulnerability exists in the programming language Ruby [1],
    versions before 1.8.5-p2. The "read_multipart" function in the
    Ruby CGI library ("cgi.rb") does not properly detect boundaries
    in MIME "multipart" content, which allows remote attackers to
    cause an infinite loop via specially crafted HTTP requests. Notice
    that this issue is not the same as CVE-2006-5467 (reported in
    OpenPKG-SA-2006.030).
