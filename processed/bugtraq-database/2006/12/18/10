4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in MailEnable, which
can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the POP service
when handling arguments passed to the "PASS" command. This can be
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by passing an overly
long, specially crafted string as argument to the affected command.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
