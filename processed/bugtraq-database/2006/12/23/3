-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
affected installations of Novell NetMail. Successful exploitation
requires the attacker to successfully authenticate to the affected
service.

The specific flaw exists in NetMail's implementation of the Network
Messaging Application Protocol (NMAP). The NMAP server lacks bounds
checking on parameters supplied to the STOR command, which can lead to
an exploitable buffer overflow. The vulnerable daemon, nmapd.exe, binds
to TCP port 689.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
