Synopsis
========

F-Prot Antivirus contains a buffer overflow and other unspecified
vulnerabilities, possibly allowing the remote execution of arbitrary
code.

Background
==========

F-Prot Antivirus is a FRISK Software antivirus program that can used
with procmail.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-antivirus/f-prot       < 4.6.7                       >= 4.6.7

Description
===========

F-Prot Antivirus version 4.6.7 fixes a heap-based buffer overflow, an
infinite loop, and other unspecified vulnerabilities.

Impact
======

Among other weaker impacts, a remote attacker could send an e-mail
containing a malicious file that would trigger the buffer overflow
vulnerability and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running F-Prot, which may be the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All F-Prot users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-antivirus/f-prot-4.6.7"
