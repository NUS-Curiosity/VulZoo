Synopsis
========

Trac allows remote attackers to execute unauthorized actions as other
users.

Background
==========

Trac is a wiki and issue tracking system for software development
projects.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/trac      < 0.10.1                             >= 0.10.1

Description
===========

Trac allows users to perform certain tasks via HTTP requests without
performing correct validation on those requests.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice an authenticated user to browse to a specially
crafted URL, allowing the attacker to execute actions in the Trac
instance as if they were the user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Trac users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/trac-0.10.1"
