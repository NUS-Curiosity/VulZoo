    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-835

Description:
    Previous versions of the gnupg package will execute attacker-provided
    code found in intentionally malformed OpenPGP packets. This allows an
    attacker to run arbitrary code as the user invoking gpg on the file
    that contains the malformed packets.
