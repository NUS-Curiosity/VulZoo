Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package are vulnerable to a local
    denial of service or privilege escalation attack by unprivileged
    users if any network bridge interface has been configured with more
    than two interfaces.  The attacker can cause the system to crash,
    and is believed to be able to provide arbitrary code that may
    (with undetermined probability) run in kernel context.  Xen dom0
    instances in the default bridging configuration are vulnerable.
    
    Previous versions of the Xen dom0 kernel did not embed the
    firmware for QLogic 2XXX Fibre Channel adapters, disabling Xen
    dom0 on those systems.
    
    This update requires a system reboot to implement the fixes.
