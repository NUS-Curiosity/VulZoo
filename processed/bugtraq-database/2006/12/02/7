Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0068

Package names:	   gnupg, tar
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-12-01
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0

Package description:
  gnupg
  GnuPG is a complete and free replacement for PGP. Because it does not
  use IDEA it can be used without any restrictions. GnuPG is in
  compliance with the OpenPGP specification (RFC2440).

  tar
  The GNU tar program saves many files together in one archive and can
  restore individual files (or all of the files) from that archive. Tar
  can also be used to add supplemental files to an archive and to update
  or list files in the archive. Tar includes multivolume support,
  automatic archive compression/decompression, the ability to perform
  remote archives, and the ability to perform incremental and full
  backups.

Problem description:
  gnupg  < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Hugh Warrington has reported a vulnerability in GnuPG,
    caused due to a boundary error in the "ask_outfile_name()" function
    in openfile.c, because the "make_printable_string()" function can
    return a string longer than the expected "NAMELEN". This can be
    exploited to cause a buffer overflow.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2006-6169 to this issue.

  tar < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - New Upstream
  - Option -l is now an alias of --check-links option.
  - SECURITY Fix: Teemu Salmela has reported a security issue in GNU tar,
    caused due to the "extract_archive()" function in extract.c and the
    "extract_mangle()" function in mangle.c still processing the
    deprecated "GNUTYPE_NAMES" record type containing symbolic links.
    This can be exploited to overwrite arbitrary files.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the
    name CVE-2006-6097 to this issue.
