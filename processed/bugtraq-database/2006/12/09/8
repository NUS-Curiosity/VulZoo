Synopsis
========

xine-lib is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the Real Media input
plugin, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

xine is a portable and reusable multimedia playback engine. xine-lib is
xine's core engine.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/xine-lib     < 1.1.2-r3                    >= 1.1.2-r3

Description
===========

A possible buffer overflow has been reported in the Real Media input
plugin.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing a user into
loading a specially crafted stream with xine or an application using
xine-lib. This can lead to a Denial of Service and possibly the
execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All xine-lib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/xine-lib-1.1.2-r3"
