Synopsis
========

There is a flaw in Wine in the handling of Windows Metafiles (WMF)
files, which could possibly result in the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Wine is a free implementation of Windows APIs for Unix-like systems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-emulation/wine     < 20050930                     >= 20050930

Description
===========

H D Moore discovered that Wine implements the insecure-by-design
SETABORTPROC GDI Escape function for Windows Metafile (WMF) files.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted Windows
Metafile (WMF) file from within a Wine executed Windows application,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the rights
of the user running Wine.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Wine users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/wine-20050930"
