Synopsis
========

Xpdf, Poppler, GPdf, libextractor and pdftohtml are vulnerable to
integer overflows that may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Xpdf is a PDF file viewer that runs under the X Window System. Poppler
is a PDF rendering library based on the Xpdf 3.0 code base. GPdf is a
PDF file viewer for the GNOME 2 platform, also based on Xpdf.
libextractor is a library which includes Xpdf code to extract arbitrary
meta-data from files. pdftohtml is a utility to convert PDF files to
HTML or XML formats that makes use of Xpdf code to decode PDF files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /   Vulnerable   /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/xpdf                 < 3.01-r5                >= 3.01-r5
  2  app-text/poppler             < 0.4.3-r4               >= 0.4.3-r4

  5  app-text/pdftohtml            < 0.36-r4               Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     5 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Chris Evans has reported some integer overflows in Xpdf when attempting
to calculate buffer sizes for memory allocation, leading to a heap
overflow and a potential infinite loop when handling malformed input
files.

Impact
======

By sending a specially crafted PDF file to a victim, an attacker could
cause an overflow, potentially resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Xpdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/xpdf-3.01-r5"

All Poppler users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/poppler-0.4.3-r4"

All GPdf users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/gpdf-2.10.0-r3"

All libextractor users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libextractor-0.5.9"

All pdftohtml users should migrate to the latest stable version of
Poppler.
