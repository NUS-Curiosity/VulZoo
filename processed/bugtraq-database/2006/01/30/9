Trustix Secure Linux Security Advisory #2006-0004

Package names:	   kernel, openssh 
Summary:           Multiple vulnerabilities
Date:              2006-01-27
Affected versions: Trustix Secure Linux 2.2
                   Trustix Secure Linux 3.0
                   Trustix Operating System - Enterprise Server 2

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package description:
  kernel
  The kernel package contains the Linux kernel (vmlinuz), the core of your
  Trustix Secure Linux operating system.  The kernel handles the basic
  functions of the operating system:  memory allocation, process allocation,
  device input and output, etc.

  openssh
  Ssh (Secure Shell) a program for logging into a remote machine and for
  executing commands in a remote machine.  It is intended to replace
  rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between
  two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connections and
  arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.

Problem description:
  kernel < TSL 3.0 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Missing validation of the "nlmsg_len" value in
    "netlink_rcv_skb()" can cause an infinite loop which can be exploited
    by local users to cause a DoS by setting the value to 0.
  - An error in the PPTP NAT helper in the handling of inbound
    PPTP_IN_CALL_REQUEST packets can cause an error in offset calculation.
    This can be exploited to cause random memory corruption and can crash
    the kernel.
  - ip_nat_pptp in the PPTP NAT helper (netfilter/ip_nat_helper_pptp.c) in
    Linux kernel 2.6.14, and other versions, allows local users to cause a
    denial of service via a crafted outbound packet that causes an incorrect
    offset to be calculated from pointer arithmetic when non-linear SKBs
    (socket buffers) are used.
  - Stefan Rompf has reported a vulnerability caused due to the "dm-crypt"
    driver failing to clear memory before freeing it. This can be exploited
    by local users to obtain sensitive information.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-0035, CVE-2006-0036, CVE-2006-0037 and
    CVE-2006-0095 to these issues.

  openssh < TSL 3.0 > < TSL 2.2 > < TSEL 2 >
  - SECURITY Fix: Josh Bressers has reported a weakness in OpenSSH
    caused due to the insecure use of the "system()" function in
    scp when performing copy operations using filenames that are
    supplied by the user from the command line. This can be exploited
    to execute shell commands with privileges of the user running scp.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the names CVE-2006-0225 to this issue.
