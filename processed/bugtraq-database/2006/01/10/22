 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDKSA-2006:003
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/

 Package : poppler
 Date    : January 5, 2006
 Affected: .
 _______________________________________________________________________
 
 Problem Description:
 
 Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the
 DCTStream::readProgressiveSOF and DCTStream::readBaselineSOF functions
 in the DCT stream parsing code (Stream.cc) in xpdf 3.01 and earlier,
 allow user-complicit attackers to cause a denial of service (heap
 corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted  PDF file
 with an out-of-range number of components (numComps), which is used as
 an array index. (CVE-2005-3191)
  
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the StreamPredictor function in Xpdf 3.01
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a PDF file with
 an out-of-range numComps (number of components) field. (CVE-2005-3192)
 
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the JPXStream::readCodestream function
 in the JPX stream parsing code (JPXStream.c) for xpdf 3.01 and earlier
 allows user-complicit attackers to cause a denial of service (heap
 corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file
 with large size values that cause insufficient memory to be allocated.
 (CVE-2005-3193)
 
 An additional patch re-addresses memory allocation routines in
 goo/gmem.c (Martin Pitt/Canonical, Dirk Mueller/KDE). 
 
 In addition, Chris Evans discovered several other vulnerabilities in
 the xpdf code base:
 
  Out-of-bounds heap accesses with large or negative parameters to 
   "FlateDecode" stream. (CVE-2005-3192)
 
  Out-of-bounds heap accesses with large or negative parameters to
   "CCITTFaxDecode" stream. (CVE-2005-3624)
 
  Infinite CPU spins in various places when stream ends unexpectedly.
   (CVE-2005-3625) 
 
  NULL pointer crash in the "FlateDecode" stream. (CVE-2005-3626)
 
  Overflows of compInfo array in "DCTDecode" stream. (CVE-2005-3627)
 
  Possible to use index past end of array in "DCTDecode" stream.
   (CVE-2005-3627)
 
  Possible out-of-bounds indexing trouble in "DCTDecode" stream.
   (CVE-2005-3627)
 
 Poppler uses an embedded copy of the xpdf code, with the same
 vulnerabilities.
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these problems.
