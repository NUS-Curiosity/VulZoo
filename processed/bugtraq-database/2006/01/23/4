Subject: LibAST 0.7 Release Fixes Security Vulnerability


I am pleased to announce the release of LibAST 0.7.  The release
summary is below.  Please note that this release contains an important
security fix; all users of LibAST are STRONGLY encouraged to update to
this latest version immediately.

The latest version can be obtained in source, RPM, and SRPM forms at:
http://www.eterm.org/download/

Release Notes:
--------------

The string class is now both an interface and an implementation so
that parallel implementations (e.g., a gstring wrapper) can be
created.  Detection of Imlib2 support, and a pixmap leak when it
was disabled, were fixed.  Also some fixes for gcc4 and newer
autotools have been included.

This release also contains a security fix for CVE-2006-0224, a buffer
overflow vulnerability discovered by Rosiello Security
(www.rosiello.org) which could lead to privilege escalation in
setuid/setgid applications using LibAST's configuration engine.  This
includes any platforms on which Eterm is setuid/setgid (e.g., setgid
utmp).  Thanks to Angelo Rosiello and his team for discovering this
issue and coordinating with me for the fix and release.
