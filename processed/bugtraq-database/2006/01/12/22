-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable ClamAV installations. Authentication is not required to
exploit this vulnerability.

This specific flaw exists within libclamav/fsg.c during the unpacking of
executable files compressed with FSG v1.33. Due to invalid bounds
checking when copying user-supplied data to heap allocated memory, an
exploitable memory corruption condition is created. The unpacking
algorithm for other versions of FSG is not affected.
