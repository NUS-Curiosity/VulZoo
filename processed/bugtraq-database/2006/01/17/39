Several security related problems have been discovered in Mantis, a
web-based bug tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2005-4238

    Missing input sanitising allows remote attackers  to inject
    arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2005-4518

    Tobias Klein discovered that Mantis allows remote attackers to
    bypass the file upload size restriction.

CVE-2005-4519

    Tobias Klein discovered several SQL injection vulnerabilities that
    allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

CVE-2005-4520

    Tobias Klein discovered unspecified "port injection"
    vulnerabilities in filters.

CVE-2005-4521

    Tobias Klein discovered a CRLF injection vulnerability that allows
    remote attackers to modify HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response
    splitting attacks.

CVE-2005-4522

    Tobias Klein discovered several cross-site scripting (XSS)
    vulnerabilities that allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary
    web script or HTML.

CVE-2005-4523

    Tobias Klein discovered that Mantis discloses private bugs via
    public RSS feeds, which allows remote attackers to obtain
    sensitive information.

CVE-2005-4524

    Tobias Klein discoverd that Mantis does not properly handle "Make
    note private" when a bug is being resolved, which has unknown
    impact and attack vectors, probably related to an information
    leak.

The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
these problems.

For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.2-5sarge1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mantis package.

        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
