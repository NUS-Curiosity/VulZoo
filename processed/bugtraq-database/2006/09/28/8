We were the first to see it in the wild, but unbeknownst to the security
community, Microsoft had reportedly been working with ISS on this issue
(ISS disclosed it on the 19th --
http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/alerts/id/237).   

One can then assume that Microsoft was already in the process of fixing
it, and while they were doing that, we started finding it exploiting
systems.
