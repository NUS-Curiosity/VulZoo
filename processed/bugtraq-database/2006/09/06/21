Synopsis
========

Streamripper is vulnerable to multiple remote buffer overflows, leading
to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Streamripper extracts and records individual MP3 file tracks from
SHOUTcast streams.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/streamripper      < 1.61.26                >= 1.61.26

Description
===========

Ulf Harnhammar, from the Debian Security Audit Project, has found that
Streamripper is vulnerable to multiple stack based buffer overflows
caused by improper bounds checking when processing malformed HTTP
headers.

Impact
======

By enticing a user to connect to a malicious server, an attacker could
execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
Streamripper

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Streamripper users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/streamripper-1.61.26"
