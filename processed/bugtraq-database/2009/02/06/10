iDefense Security Advisory 02.06.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 06, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

HP Network Node Manager (NNM) is an application suite that is used to
map out and manage network topography. NNM runs on a variety of
platforms, including Linux and multiple versions of Windows. For more
information, see the vendor's site found at the following link.

http://www.openview.hp.com/products/nnm/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities
in Hewlett-Packard Development Co. LP (HP)'s Network Node Manager could
allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information.

Two vulnerabilities exist within the CGI applications distributed with
NNM.

The first vulnerability exists in the nnmRptConfig.exe CGI application.
When responding to specifically crafted requests, the CGI will disclose
the location of log directories.

The second vulnerability exists within the ovlaunch.exe CGI. If a
parameter is incorrectly set in a specific request, the application
will return various configuration details.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in the disclosure of
sensitive information. While the direct effects of these
vulnerabilities are minimal, they may be useful to an attacker
attempting to exploit other vulnerabilities.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities in Network
Node Manager version 7.53 for Linux and Windows. Previous versions may
also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for these issues.
