4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered some vulnerabilities in Free Download
Manager, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

1) A boundary error in the parsing of file names inside torrent files
can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via an overly 
long file name.

2) Two boundary errors when parsing names from torrent files can be 
exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflows via overly long file
names.

3) A boundary error when parsing tracker URLs from torrent files can 
be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly 
long tracker URL.

4) A boundary error when parsing comments from torrent files can be
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long 
comment.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows execution of 
arbitrary code by e.g. tricking a user into opening a specially 
crafted torrent file.
