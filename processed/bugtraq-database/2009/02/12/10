Synopsis
========

An error in the OpenSSL certificate chain validation might allow for
spoofing attacks.

Background
==========

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/openssl      < 0.9.8j                          >= 0.9.8j

Description
===========

The Google Security Team reported that several functions incorrectly
check the result after calling the EVP_VerifyFinal() function, allowing
a malformed signature to be treated as a good signature rather than as
an error. This issue affects the signature checks on DSA and ECDSA keys
used with SSL/TLS.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability and spoof arbitrary
names to conduct Man-In-The-Middle attacks and intercept sensitive
information.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8j"

References
==========

  [ 1 ] CVE-2008-5077
        http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5077

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:

Concerns?
=========

Security is a primary focus of Gentoo Linux and ensuring the
confidentiality and security of our users machines is of utmost
importance to us. Any security concerns should be addressed to
