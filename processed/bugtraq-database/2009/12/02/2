Hi all,

I really apologize for the mistake. The released code about this flaw 
seems not working because of the "authid current_user" clause used 
during the creation of the DRVXTABC package.
There were some contributory causes that drive me into the wrong way.

As previously reported by Alexandr Polyakov, the injection still works 
but impacts only confidentiality and integrity.

Regards,
