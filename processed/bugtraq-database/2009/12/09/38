-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node
Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the ovwebsnmpsrv.exe application which
is launched when a request is received for the jovgraph.exe CGI
application. This process copies the contents of the 'sel' POST variable
a user-controllable amount of times into a static stack buffer. By
repeating a specific string as the contents of the 'arg' POST variable
this buffer can be overflowed leading to arbitrary code execution.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
