-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious web page or open a malicious SWF file.

The specific flaw exists in the generation of ActionScript exception
handlers. In Verifier::parseExceptionHandlers(), a large value for
exception_count will result in an integer overflow condition leading to
a memory corruption which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code
under the context of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
