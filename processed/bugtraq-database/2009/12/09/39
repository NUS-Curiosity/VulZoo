-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of multiple Symantec products. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the VRTSweb.exe Web Server component
which listens by default on TCP ports 8181, 8443, and 14300. The process
fails to properly validate an authentication request made to port 14300.
By providing a specific request an attacker can bypass the
authentication and instruct the process to unpack and execute data
within an arbitrary WAR file. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary
code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
