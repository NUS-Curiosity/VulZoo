 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2009:342
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : acpid
 Date    : December 26, 2009
 Affected: Corporate 4.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in acpid:
 
 A certain Red Hat patch for acpid 1.0.4 effectively triggers a call
 to the open function with insufficient arguments, which might allow
 local users to leverage weak permissions on /var/log/acpid, and obtain
 sensitive information by reading this file, cause a denial of service
 by overwriting this file, or gain privileges by executing this file
 (CVE-2009-4033).
 
 acpid 1.0.4 sets an unrestrictive umask, which might allow local users
 to leverage weak permissions on /var/log/acpid, and obtain sensitive
 information by reading this file or cause a denial of service by
 overwriting this file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-4033
 (CVE-2009-4235).
 
 This update provides a solution to these vulnerabilities.
