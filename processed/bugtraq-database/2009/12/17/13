Subject: [Suspected Spam][oCERT-2009-019] Ganeti path sanitization errors


#2009-019 Ganeti path sanitization errors

Description:

Ganeti, an open source virtualisation manager, suffers from an input
validation bug that poses a security risk.

The vulnerability applies to the commands submitted, either locally via
gnt-* commands or remotely via the HTTP API, to the machine acting as a
cluster master. Validation for a file path argument is missing resulting
in arbitrary code execution, local exploitation applies to any user with
rights to execute ganeti commands while remote exploitation applies to
configured users authenticated over the ganeti RAPI.

While the local exploitation is a non-issue for the root user, which can
execute arbitrary commands in any case, it affects local non-root users
which are allowed to execute gnt-* commands via sudo or other suid
wrappers.

Affected version:

Ganeti >= 1.2.4 (local), >= 2.0.0 (remote)

Fixed version:

Ganeti >= 1.2.9, >= 2.0.5, >= 2.1.0~rc2
