 Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

iDefense Security Advisory 06.26.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 26, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

HP Network Node Manager (NNM) is an application suite that is used to
map out and manage network topography. NNM runs on a variety of
platforms, including Linux and multiple versions of Windows. For more
information, see the vendor's site at the following link.

http://www.openview.hp.com/products/nnm/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability in
Hewlett-Packard Development Co. LP (HP)'s Network Node Manager could
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
affected service.

The vulnerability exists within the 'rping' application, which is
distributed with the Linux version of NNM. It is possible for a remote
attacker to launch the 'rping' application and trigger a stack based
buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the affected service. On RedHat Enterprise
4, the application is started as the user 'bin'. 'rping' is not
compiled with compiler protections such as stack cookies or the -pie
flag, which makes exploitation less difficult.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Network
Node Manager version 7.53 for Linux. Previous versions may also be
affected. The Windows version is not affected.

V. WORKAROUND

By default, the webappmon.exe CGI application does not require a user to
be authenticated. By changing the session.conf file and setting
UserLogin to ON, it is possible to require valid credentials in order
to run. The 'ovhtpasswd' application can then be used to add valid
credentials.
