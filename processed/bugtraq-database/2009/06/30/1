Synopsis
========

Multiple errors in phpMyAdmin might allow the remote execution of
arbitrary code or a Cross-Site Scripting attack.

Background
==========

phpMyAdmin is a web-based management tool for MySQL databases.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/phpmyadmin     < 2.11.9.5                      >= 2.11.9.5

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin:

* Greg Ose discovered that the setup script does not sanitize input
  properly, leading to the injection of arbitrary PHP code into the
  configuration file (CVE-2009-1151).

* Manuel Lopez Gallego and Santiago Rodriguez Collazo reported that
  data from cookies used in the "Export" page is not properly sanitized
  (CVE-2009-1150).

Impact
======

A remote unauthorized attacker could exploit the first vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
phpMyAdmin and conduct Cross-Site Scripting attacks using the second
vulnerability.

Workaround
==========

Removing the "scripts/setup.php" file protects you from CVE-2009-1151.

Resolution
==========

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.11.9.5"
