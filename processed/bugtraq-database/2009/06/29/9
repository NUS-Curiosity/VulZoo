Synopsis
========

A flaw in the Ruby standard library might allow remote attackers to
cause a Denial of Service attack.

Background
==========

Ruby is an interpreted object-oriented programming language. The
elaborate standard library includes the "BigDecimal" class.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /   Vulnerable   /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/ruby     < 1.8.6_p369                      >= 1.8.6_p369

Description
===========

Tadayoshi Funaba reported that BigDecimal in
ext/bigdecimal/bigdecimal.c does not properly handle string arguments
containing overly long numbers.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this issue to remotely cause a Denial
of Service attack.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.6_p369"

==========
