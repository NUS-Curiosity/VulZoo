Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in libpng that allows for
information disclosure.

Background
==========

libpng is the official PNG reference library used to read, write and
manipulate PNG images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libpng      < 1.2.37                         >= 1.2.37

Description
===========

Jeff Phillips discovered that libpng does not properly parse 1-bit
interlaced images with width values that are not divisible by 8, which
causes libpng to include uninitialized bits in certain rows of a PNG
file.

Impact
======

A remote attacker might entice a user to open a specially crafted PNG
file, possibly resulting in the disclosure of sensitive memory
portions.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libpng users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.37"
