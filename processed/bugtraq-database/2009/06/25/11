 Stack Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Hash: SHA1

iDefense Security Advisory 06.25.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 25, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Motorola Inc.'s Timbuktu Pro is a remote control software that allows
remote access to a computer's desktop. It is available for Mac OS X and
Windows systems and provides integration with Skype and SSH. More
information is available on Motorola's web site at the following URL.

http://www.netopia.com/software/products/tb2/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in
Motorola Inc.'s Timbuktu Pro could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
code with SYSTEM privileges.

Timbuktu fails to properly handle user-supplied data passed through a
named pipe session. When the PlughNTCommand named pipe receives an
overly large character string, a buffer overflow will occur resulting
in arbitrary code execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code
with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker would need to locate a system
running the Timbuktu Pro software. Upon finding a system that is
running the vulnerable software, the attacker would check for the
availability of the PlughNTCommand named pipe. If the named pipe is
available, the attacker can connect and create a session without
authenticating. The attacker can then send malformed data to the
Timbuktu Pro process, resulting in arbitrary code execution with
elevated privileges.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Timbuktu
Pro version 8.6.5. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

A named pipe filter can be applied to the registry. Named pipe filtering
can be done in two ways dynamic filtering and white listing. Microsoft
provides further details about how to implement this workaround.
