Synopsis
========

An incomplete fix for an issue related to the Lynx URL handler might
allow for the remote execution of arbitrary commands.

Background
==========

Lynx is a fully-featured WWW client for users running
cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices such as vt100
terminals and terminal emulators.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/lynx     < 2.8.6-r4                        >= 2.8.6-r4

Description
===========

Clint Ruoho reported that the fix for CVE-2005-2929 (GLSA 200511-09)
only disabled the lynxcgi:// handler when not using the advanced mode.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can entice a user to access a malicious HTTP server,
causing Lynx to execute arbitrary commands. NOTE: The advanced mode is
not enabled by default. Successful exploitation requires the
"lynxcgi://" protocol to be registered with lynx on the victim's
system.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Lynx users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =www-client/lynx-2.8.6-r4
