Synopsis
========

Adobe Reader is vulnerable to remote code execution via crafted PDF
files.

Background
==========

Adobe Reader is a PDF reader released by Adobe.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/acroread       < 8.1.6                          >= 8.1.6

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Adobe Reader:

* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research reported a heap-based buffer
  overflow in the JBIG2 filter (CVE-2009-0198).

* Mark Dowd of the IBM Internet Security Systems X-Force and Nicolas
  Joly of VUPEN Security reported multiple heap-based buffer overflows
  in the JBIG2 filter (CVE-2009-0509, CVE-2009-0510, CVE-2009-0511,
  CVE-2009-0512, CVE-2009-0888, CVE-2009-0889)

* Arr1val reported that multiple methods in the JavaScript API might
  lead to memory corruption when called with crafted arguments
  (CVE-2009-1492, CVE-2009-1493).

* An anonymous researcher reported a stack-based buffer overflow
  related to U3D model files with a crafted extension block
  (CVE-2009-1855).

* Jun Mao and Ryan Smith of iDefense Labs reported an integer
  overflow related to the FlateDecode filter, which triggers a
  heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-1856).

* Haifei Li of Fortinet's FortiGuard Global Security Research Team
  reported a memory corruption vulnerability related to TrueType fonts
  (CVE-2009-1857).

* The Apple Product Security Team reported a memory corruption
  vulnerability in the JBIG2 filter (CVE-2009-1858).

* Matthew Watchinski of Sourcefire VRT reported an unspecified memory
  corruption (CVE-2009-1859).

* Will Dormann of CERT reported multiple heap-based buffer overflows
  when processing JPX (aka JPEG2000) stream that trigger heap memory
  corruption (CVE-2009-1861).

* Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities have been discovered
  (CVE-2009-2028).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Reader users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/acroread-8.1.6"
