 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2009:166
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : c-client
 Date    : July 28, 2009
 Affected: Enterprise Server 5.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Security vulnerabilities has been identified and fixed in University
 of Washington IMAP Toolkit:
 
 Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in (1) University of Washington
 IMAP Toolkit 2002 through 2007c, (2) University of Washington Alpine
 2.00 and earlier, and (3) Panda IMAP allow (a) local users to gain
 privileges by specifying a long folder extension argument on the
 command line to the tmail or dmail program; and (b) remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code by sending e-mail to a destination mailbox name
 composed of a username and '+' character followed by a long string,
 processed by the tmail or possibly dmail program (CVE-2008-5005).
 
 smtp.c in the c-client library in University of Washington IMAP Toolkit
 2007b allows remote SMTP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL
 pointer dereference and application crash) by responding to the QUIT
 command with a close of the TCP connection instead of the expected
 221 response code (CVE-2008-5006).
 
 Off-by-one error in the rfc822_output_char function in the RFC822BUFFER
 routines in the University of Washington (UW) c-client library, as
 used by the UW IMAP toolkit before imap-2007e and other applications,
 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
 via an e-mail message that triggers a buffer overflow (CVE-2008-5514).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to prevent this. Note that the
 software was renamed to c-client starting from Mandriva Linux 2009.0
 and only provides the shared c-client library for the imap functions
 in PHP.
