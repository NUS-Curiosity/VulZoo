Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Nagios may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Nagios is an open source host, service and network monitoring program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/nagios-core     < 3.0.6-r2               >= 3.0.6-r2

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Nagios:

* Paul reported that statuswml.cgi does not properly sanitize shell
  metacharacters in the (1) ping and (2) traceroute parameters
  (CVE-2009-2288).

* Nagios does not properly verify whether an authenticated user is
  authorized to run certain commands (CVE-2008-5027).

* Andreas Ericsson reported that Nagios does not perform validity
  checks to verify HTTP requests, leading to Cross-Site Request Forgery
  (CVE-2008-5028).

* An unspecified vulnerability in Nagios related to CGI programs,
  "adaptive external commands," and "writing newlines and submitting
  service comments" has been reported (CVE-2008-6373).

Impact
======

A remote authenticated or unauthenticated attacker may exploit these
vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary commands or elevate privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Nagios users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=net-analyzer/nagios-core-3.0.6-r2"

NOTE: Users of the Nagios 2 branch can update to version 2.12-r1 which
contains a patch to fix CVE-2009-2288. However, that branch is not
supported upstream or in Gentoo and we are unaware whether the other
vulnerabilities affect 2.x installations.
