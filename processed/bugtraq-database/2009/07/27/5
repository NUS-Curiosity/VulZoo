Description:
    Previous versions of the Linux kernel are vulnerable to multiple
    security issues, including both man-in-the-middle/hostile server
    attacks and remote denial of service attacks that are specific
    to certain hardware configurations; these vulnerabilities are
    resolved in this version.  Additionally, although no rPath kernel is
    vulnerable to the widely-publicized local root exploit identified
    as CVE-2009-1897, a patch has been applied to guard against other
    similar but as yet unknown vulnerabilities.
