and as yet undiscovered threats worldwide. Home users, businesses, 
service providers, government agencies, and our partners all trust 
our unmatched security expertise and have confidence in our 
comprehensive and proven solutions to effectively block attacks

II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The parsing engine can be bypassed by a specially crafted and formated
RAR (Headflags and Packsize),ZIP (Filelenght) archive.

III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~
A general description of the impact and nature of AV Bypasses/evasions
can be read at : 
http://blog.zoller.lu/2009/04/case-for-av-bypassesevasions.html

The bug results in denying the engine the possibility to inspect
code within RAR and ZIP archives. There is no inspection of the content
at all and hence the impossibility to detect malicious code.
