Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Pidgin might allow for the remote execution
of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Pidgin (formerly Gaim) is an instant messaging client for a variety of
instant messaging protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/pidgin       < 2.5.6                              >= 2.5.6

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin:

* Veracode reported a boundary error in the "XMPP SOCKS5 bytestream
  server" when initiating an outgoing file transfer (CVE-2009-1373).

* Ka-Hing Cheung reported a heap corruption flaw in the QQ protocol
  handler (CVE-2009-1374).

* A memory corruption flaw in "PurpleCircBuffer" was disclosed by
  Josef Andrysek (CVE-2009-1375).

* The previous fix for CVE-2008-2927 contains a cast from uint64 to
  size_t, possibly leading to an integer overflow (CVE-2009-1376, GLSA
  200901-13).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted messages or files using
the MSN, XMPP or QQ protocols, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application,
or a Denial of Service. NOTE: Successful exploitation might require the
victim's interaction.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Pidgin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-im/pidgin-2.5.6"
