Subject: Oracle PL/SQL Injection Flaw in REPCAT_RPC.VALIDATE_REMOTE_RC

Hey all,
The Oracle REPCAT_RPC.VALIDATE_REMOTE_RC function executes blocks of 
anonymous PL/SQL that can be influenced by an attacker to execute arbitrary 
PL/SQL. As this package is only accessible directly by SYS this flaw would 
not normally present a risk. However, the REPCAT_RPC.VALIDATE_REMOTE_RC 
function can be used as an auxiliary inject function to escalate privileges. 
This is described in a paper I wrote in February 2007 after reporting the 
issue but am only releasing now as the flaw has fixed by Oracle in their 
July 2009 Critical Patch Update. This flaw documents the currently 
unspecified flaw at 
http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2009-1021

The paper is available from 
http://www.databasesecurity.com/oracle/plsql-injection-create-session.pdf

Please note that many of the techniques discussed in this paper have been 
superceded by cursor injection 
(http://www.databasesecurity.com/dbsec/cursor-injection.pdf) which was 
written 3 days after.

Cheers,
David Litchfield
