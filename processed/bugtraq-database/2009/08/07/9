After backing up the TCPIP$BIND_SERVER.EXE file, copy the new file to the TCPIP$BIND_SERVER.EXE image already existing in the SYS$COMMON: [SYSEXE] directory and restart the BIND server.

Use these steps to install the new images on a system:

1. Make a safe backup copy of TCPIP$BIND_SERVER.EXE image already existing in the SYS$COMMON: [SYSEXE] directory.

2. Copy the new patch image for the correct architecture and TCP/IP Services versions to TCPIP$BIND_SERVER.EXE to the SYS$COMMON: [SYSEXE].

3. Restart the BIND service using the commands to shutdown and start the service:
Stop the service: @sys$startup:tcpip$bind_shutdown.com
Start the BIND service: @sys$startup:tcpip$bind_startup.com
