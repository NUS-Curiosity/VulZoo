References:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2417

Description:
    Previous versions of the curl package do not properly validate X.509
    certificates with NULL bytes in the domain name portion of the Common
    Name field, which can allow man-in-the-middle attacks which spoof
    arbitrary SSL servers by presenting crafted certificates signed by
    legitimate certification authorities.
