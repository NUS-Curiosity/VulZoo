Synopsis
========

dhcpd as included in the ISC DHCP implementation does not properly
handle special conditions, leading to a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

ISC DHCP is the reference implementation of the Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol as specified in RFC 2131.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/dhcp     < 3.1.2_p1                          >= 3.1.2_p1

Description
===========

Christoph Biedl discovered that dhcpd does not properly handle certain
DHCP requests when configured both using "dhcp-client-identifier" and
"hardware ethernet".

Impact
======

A remote attacker might send a specially crafted request to dhcpd,
possibly resulting in a Denial of Service (daemon crash).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ISC DHCP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =net-misc/dhcp-3.1.2_p1
