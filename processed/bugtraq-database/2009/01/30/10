Successfully tested on: Novell GroupWise WebAccess 7.0.3

vulnerability:

GroupWise 8.0 (shipping 8.0 release only)

CVE reference: CVE-2009-0273

Description:

Novell GroupWise WebAcces is vulnerable to a vanilla XSS
(non-persistent) via POST requests. Although filtering takes place for
GET requests, POST requests are ignored.

Vulnerable server-side script: '/gw/webacc',
Unfiltered parameter: 'User.id', 'Library.queryText'


Proof of concept:

_As kindly requested by Novell, ProCheckUp will delay publication of the
PoC details to allow GroupWise customers time to apply the recommended
security patches._

Consequences:

An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code
in the browser of a victim user who visits a malicious third-party page.
Such code would run within the security context of the target domain.

This type of attack can result in non-persistent defacement of the
target site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e.:
session IDs, address books, emails) to unauthorised third parties.
