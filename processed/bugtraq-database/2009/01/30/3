Description
-----------
A security review of OpenX 2.6.3 was recently being conducted on Openx
2.6.3 by Sarid Harper on behalf of Secunia and reported to us. One of
the vulnerabilities was also independently discovered by Charlie Briggs
and disclosed on milw0rm.com, forcing Secunia to publish the research
results before our fix releases were ready.

The review contains a list of 22 items for multiple vulnerabilities
ranging from XSS to SQL injection to directory traversal. Some are only
exploitable by authenticated users, others can be conducted by
unauthenticated users.

All the the items were fixed in OpenX 2.6 and backported to 2.4 when
applicable. New versions of both OpenX 2.6 and 2.4 have been released.

Solution
--------
 - Upgrade to OpenX 2.4.10 or 2.6.4
