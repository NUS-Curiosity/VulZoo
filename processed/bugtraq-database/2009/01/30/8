Successfully tested on: Novell GroupWise WebAcess 7.0.3

Novell has confirmed the following versions to be affected by this
vulnerability:

GroupWise 6.5x
GroupWise 7.0, 7.01, 7.02x, 7.03
GroupWise 8.0 (shipping 8.0 release only)

CVE reference: CVE-2009-0273

Description:

Novell GroupWise Webaccess (7.0.3) is vulnerable to a *persistent* XSS
via HTML email or HTML attachments.

Proof of concept:

_As kindly requested by Novell, ProCheckUp will delay publication of the
PoC details to allow GroupWise customers time to apply the recommended
security patches._

 Consequences:

An attacker may be able to cause execution of malicious scripting code
in the browser of any user. Such code would run within the security
context of the target domain.

This type of attack can result in a persistent defacement of the target
site, or the redirection of confidential information (i.e.: session IDs,
address books, emails) to unauthorised third parties.

Since this XSS is of persistent nature, the user wouldn't have to be
tricked to visit a specially-crafted URL, but just read an e-mail.
