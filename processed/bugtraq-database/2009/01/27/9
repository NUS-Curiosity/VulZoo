Introduction:
-------------
The vulnerability found targets the SAP NetWeaver portal. It is
possible to execute JavaScript code in the browser of a valid user
when clicking on a specially crafted URL which can be sent to the
user by email.
This vulnerability can be used to steal the user's session cookie or
redirect him to a phishing website which shows the (faked) login
screen and gets his logon credentials as soon as he tries to log in
on the faked site.

Affected:
---------
- All tested versions that are vulnerable
	SAP NetWeaver/Web DynPro
	[for detailed Information, see SAP Notification 1235253]

Description:
------------
A specially crafted URL in SAP NetWeaver allows an attacker to
launch a Cross-Site Scripting attack. The resulting page contains
only the unfiltered value of the vulnerable parameter. It is possible
to create an URL which causes the resulting page to contain malicious
JavaScript code. A response to such a request could look like the
following example:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 18 Jul 2008 13:13:30 GMT
Server: <server>
content-type: text/plain
Content-Length: 67
Keep-Alive: timeout=10, max=500
Connection: Keep-Alive

<html><title>test</title><body onload="alert(document.cookie)">
</body></html>

The code only gets executed in Microsoft Internet Explorer (tested
with version 7.0.5730 only). In Firefox (tested with version 3.0
only) it did not get executed as the content-type header of the
server response is interpreted more strictly (text/plain).

SAP Information Policy:
-----------------------
The information is available to registered SAP clients only (SAP
Security Notes).
