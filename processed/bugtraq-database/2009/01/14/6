iDefense Security Advisory 01.13.09

Jan 13, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Oracle Corp.'s Secure Backup is a tape backup management software, for
more information, please visit following website:
http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/secure-backup/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of two command injection vulnerabilities in the
authentication component of Oracle Corp.'s Secure Backup Administration
Server could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary
commands in the context of the running server.

In both cases, the vulnerabilities exist in PHP scripts that
authenticate a user attempting to use the service.

The first vulnerability is in "php/login.php". By making a login request
with a specially crafted cookie value, an attacker can execute arbitrary
code on the server.

The second vulnerability is in "php/common.php". This function is called
from the "login.php" page. A variable is used to specify a command to be
run. An attacker can supply any shell command for this variable and it
will be executed in the context of the web server process.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands in
the context of the web server process. Under Windows, the
Administration Server runs as SYSTEM, so the injected command will be
executed as SYSTEM. Under Linux it runs as an unprivileged user. No
authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

Oracle Corp.'s Secure Backup version 10.2.0.2 for Linux, and Secure
Backup version 10.2.0.2 for Windows have been confirmed vulnerable.
Other versions and other platforms may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Block access to the httpd interface of vulnerable servers.
