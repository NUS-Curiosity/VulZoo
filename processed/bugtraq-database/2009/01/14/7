iDefense Security Advisory 01.13.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jan 13, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Oracle Secure Backup is a network backup system for Oracle Databases.
For more information, see:

http://www.oracle.com/database/secure-backup.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an input validation vulnerability in the
authentication component of Oracle Corp.'s Secure Backup Administration
Server could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary
commands in the context of the running server.

The vulnerability is in a function of common.php which is called from
the login.php page. The script fails to sanitize the input when
verifying the user has permission to use the service.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain complete control over
an affected system. Because the the Administration Server runs as an
unprivileged user, commands will be executed as that user. Under the
Linux (and possibly other) installations many files are installed world
writable. These include the configuration file for the Apache web-server
that the Administration Server is built on. This server starts as the
root user and changes to a user specified by the configuration files.
Since these files are writable by the user it may be possible for them
to gain access to the root user account. Other configuration and
executable files are also able to be changed.

IV. DETECTION

Oracle Corp.'s Secure Backup version 10.1.0.3 for Linux has been
confirmed vulnerable. Other versions and other platforms may also be
affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Block access to the httpd interface of vulnerable servers Remove write
access for 'other' users to all files. The following command will
recursively change the permissions to remove write permission to
'other'.

chmod -R o-w directory/

This may prevent some aspects of the system from functioning correctly.
