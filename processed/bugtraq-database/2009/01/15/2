Synopsis
========

A Denial of Service vulnerability has been discovered in Avahi.

Background
==========

Avahi is a system that facilitates service discovery on a local
network.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected

    1  net-dns/avahi      < 0.6.24                             >= 0.6.24

Description
===========

Hugo Dias reported a failed assertion in the
originates_from_local_legacy_unicast_socket() function in
avahi-core/server.c when processing mDNS packets with a source port of
0.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets to the daemon,
leading to its crash.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Avahi users should upgrade to the latest version:
