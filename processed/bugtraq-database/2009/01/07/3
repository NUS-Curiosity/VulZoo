4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered vulnerabilities in HP OpenView Network
Node Manager, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise
a vulnerable system.

1) Various boundary errors in the OpenView5.exe CGI application when
processing parameters can be exploited to cause stack-based buffer 
overflows via HTTP requests to the CGI application with overly long 
parameter strings.

2) A boundary error in ov.dll can be exploited to cause a stack-based
buffer overflow by e.g. sending a HTTP request to the OpenView5.exe 
CGI application with an overly long parameter string.

3) A boundary error in the getcvdata.exe CGI application can be 
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by sending a HTTP 
request to the CGI application with an overly long parameter string.

4) A boundary error in the ovlaunch.exe CGI application can be 
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by sending a HTTP 
request to the CGI application with an overly long parameter string.

5) A boundary error in the Toolbar.exe CGI application can be 
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by sending a HTTP 
request to the CGI application with an overly long parameter string.

6) A boundary error in the Toolbar.exe CGI application can be 
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow by sending a HTTP 
request to the CGI application with an overly long parameter string.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows execution of 
arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Restrict access to the affected CGI applications.

The vendor is reportedly working on fixes.
