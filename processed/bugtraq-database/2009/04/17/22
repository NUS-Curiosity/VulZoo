Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability in libsndfile might allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing
sampled sound.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libsndfile      < 1.0.19                     >= 1.0.19

Description
===========

Alin Rad Pop from Secunia Research reported an integer overflow when
processing CAF description chunks, leading to a heap-based buffer
overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted CAF
file, resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libsndfile users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libsndfile-1.0.19"
