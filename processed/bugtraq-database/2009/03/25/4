Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Devices running affected versions of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS
XE Software are affected when configured to use any of the following
features within Cisco IOS:

  * Airline Product Set (ALPS)
  * Serial Tunnel Code (STUN) and Block Serial Tunnel Code (BSTUN)
  * Native Client Interface Architecture support (NCIA)
  * Data-link switching (DLSw)
  * Remote Source-Route Bridging (RSRB)
  * Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
  * X.25 for Record Boundary Preservation (RBP)
  * X.25 over TCP (XOT)
  * X.25 Routing

Information on how to determine whether an affected feature is
enabled on a device are provided in the Details section of this
advisory.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system
banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by
displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System
Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in
parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release
name. Other Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or
may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router#show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software

Workarounds
===========

The following mitigations have been identified for this
vulnerability, which may help protect an infrastructure until an
upgrade to a fixed version of Cisco IOS software can be scheduled:

Infrastructure Access Control Lists
+----------------------------------

Although it is often difficult to block traffic that transits a
network, it is possible to identify traffic that should never be
allowed to target infrastructure devices and block that traffic at
the border of networks. Infrastructure Access Control Lists (iACLs)
are a network security best practice and should be considered as a
long-term addition to good network security as well as a workaround
for these specific vulnerabilities. The iACL example below should be
included as part of the deployed infrastructure access-list which
will protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP
address range:

Receive ACLs (rACL)
+------------------

For distributed platforms, Receive ACLs may be an option starting in
Cisco IOS Software Versions 12.0(21)S2 for the 12000 (GSR), 12.0(24)S
for the 7500, and 12.0(31)S for the 10720. The Receive ACL protects
the device from harmful traffic before the traffic can impact the
route processor. Receive ACLs are designed to only protect the device
on which it is configured. On the 12000, 7500, and 10720, transit
traffic is never affected by a receive ACL. Because of this, the
destination IP address "any" used in the example ACL entries below
only refer to the router's own physical or virtual IP addresses.
Receive ACLs are considered a network security best practice, and
should be considered as a long-term addition to good network
security, as well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability.
The white paper entitled "Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure
Protection Access Control Lists" presents guidelines and recommended
deployment techniques for infrastructure protection access lists.

Control Plane Policing
+---------------------

Control Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block the affected
features TCP traffic access to the device. Cisco IOS software
releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the
CoPP feature. CoPP can be configured on a device to protect the
management and control planes and minimize the risk and effectiveness
of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only
authorized traffic that is sent to infrastructure devices in
accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The
CoPP example below should be included as part of the deployed CoPP
that will protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure
IP address range.


    !---
    !--- Only sections pertaining to features enabled on the device
    !--- need be configured.

    !---

    policy-map drop-tcp-traffic
     class drop-tcp-class
      drop

    !---
    !--- Apply the Policy-Map to the 
    !--- Control-Plane of the device
    !---

    control-plane
     service-policy input drop-tcp-traffic

In the above CoPP example, the access control list entries (ACEs)
that match the potential exploit packets with the "permit" action
result in these packets being discarded by the policy-map "drop"
function, while packets that match the "deny" action (not shown) are
not affected by the policy-map drop function. Please note that the
policy-map syntax is different in the 12.2S and 12.0S Cisco IOS
trains:

    policy-map drop-tcp-traffic
      class drop-tcp-class
        police 32000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action drop
