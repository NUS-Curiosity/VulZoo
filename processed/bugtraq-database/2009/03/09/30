Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in cURL may allow for arbitrary file access.

Background
==========

cURL is a command line tool for transferring files with URL syntax,
supporting numerous protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/curl      < 7.19.4                             >= 7.19.4

Description
===========

David Kierznowski reported that the redirect implementation accepts
arbitrary Location values when CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION is enabled.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could possibly exploit this vulnerability to make
remote HTTP servers trigger arbitrary requests to intranet servers and
read or overwrite arbitrary files via a redirect to a file: URL, or, if
the libssh2 USE flag is enabled, execute arbitrary commands via a
redirect to an scp: URL.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All cURL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/curl-7.19.4"
