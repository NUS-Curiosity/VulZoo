Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Opera, the worst of which allow
for the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Opera is a fast web browser that is available free of charge.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/opera       < 9.64                             >= 9.64

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Opera:

* Vitaly McLain reported a heap-based buffer overflow when processing
  host names in file:// URLs (CVE-2008-5178).

* Alexios Fakos reported a vulnerability in the HTML parsing engine
  when processing web pages that trigger an invalid pointer calculation
  and heap corruption (CVE-2008-5679).

* Red XIII reported that certain text-area contents can be
  manipulated to cause a buffer overlow (CVE-2008-5680).

* David Bloom discovered that unspecified "scripted URLs" are not
  blocked during the feed preview (CVE-2008-5681).

* Robert Swiecki of the Google Security Team reported a Cross-site
  scripting vulnerability (CVE-2008-5682).

* An unspecified vulnerability reveals random data (CVE-2008-5683).

* Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team reported a vulnerability
  when processing JPEG images that may corrupt memory (CVE pending).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted JPEG
image to cause a Denial of Service or execute arbitrary code, to
process an overly long file:// URL or to open a specially crafted web
page to execute arbitrary code. He could also read existing
subscriptions and force subscriptions to arbitrary feed URLs, as well
as inject arbitrary web script or HTML via built-in XSLT templates.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.64"
