Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 03.17.09: Autonomy KeyView Word Perfect
 File Parsing Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 03.17.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Mar 17, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Autonomy KeyView SDK is a commercial SDK that provides many file format
parsing libraries. It supports a large number of different document
formats, one of which is the Word Perfect Document (WPD) format. It is
used by several popular vendors for processing documents. For more
information, visit the URL below.

http://www.autonomy.com/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack-based buffer overflow in Autonomy Inc's
KeyView SDK allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the current user.

This vulnerability exists within the "wp6sr.dll" which implements the
processing of Word Perfect Documents. When processing certain records,
data is copied from the file into a fixed-size stack buffer without
ensuring that enough space is available. By overflowing the buffer, an
attacker can overwrite control flow structures stored on the stack.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker must cause a specially crafted Word Perfect Document to be
processed by an application using the Autonmoy KeyView SDK.

In cases such as Lotus Notes, this requires that an attacker convince a
user to view an e-mail attachment. However, in other cases processing
may take place automatically as a document is examined.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed that this vulnerability exists within Lotus Notes 8
installed on a Windows XP SP3 machine. All applications which utilize
the Autonomy KeyView SDK to process Word Perfect Documents are
suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

For Lotus Notes, it is possible to disable the processing of WPD files
by removing, or commenting out, the line referencing "wp6sr.dll" from
the "KeyView.ini" file within the Lotus Notes program directory.
Deleting "wp6sr.dll" from the affected system will also prevent
exploitation.

For Symantec Mail Security, disabling "content filtering" will prevent
exploitation.

Additional workarounds are available from the individual vendors'
advisories referenced below.
