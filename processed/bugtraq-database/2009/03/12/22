Subject: [oCERT-2008-015] glib and glib-predecessor heap overflows

#2008-015 glib and glib-predecessors heap overflows

Description:

Base64 encoding and decoding functions in glib suffer from
vulnerabilities during memory allocation which may result in arbitrary
code execution when processing large strings.  A number of other
GNOME-related applications which predate glib are vulnerable due to the
commonality of this flawed code.

In all cases, heap memory is allocated using a length calculated with a
user-supplied, platform-specifc value.  It follows the pattern below:

  g_malloc(user_supplied_length * 3 / 4 + some_small_num)

Due to the evaluation order of arithmetic operations, the length is
multiplied by 3 prior to division by 4.  This will allow the calculated
argument used for allocation length to overflow resulting in a region
which is smaller than expected.
