Subject: Marvell Driver Multiple Information Element Overflows

Title:
------
* Marvell Driver Multiple Information Element Overflows

Summary:
--------
* The wireless drivers in some Wi-Fi access points (such as the
MARVELL-based Linksys WAP4400N) do not correctly parse information
elements included in association requests. Most information elements are
used by the wireless access point and clients to advertise their
capabilities (regarding rates, network name, cryptographic capabilities...).

Assigned CVE:
-------------
* CVE-2007-5475

Details:
--------
* The bug can be triggered by a malicious association request to the
wireless access point (the information element could be a rates,
extended rates, or any supported information element that will be parsed
by the flawed parser, the information element uses an inappropriate
length, typically too long). This can be achieved only after a
successful 802.11 authentication (in "Open" or "Shared" mode according
to the configuration of the wireless access point).

Attack Impact:
--------------
* Denial-of-service (reboot or hang-up) and possibly remote arbitrary
code execution

Attack Vector:
--------------
* Unauthenticated wireless device

Timeline:
---------
* 2007-10-22 - Vulnerability reported to Linksys
* 2007-10-23 - Full details sent to Linksys
* 2009-09-10 - Cisco/Linksys released a patched firmware (1.2.19)
* 2009-11-10 - Release of this security advisory

Affected Products:
------------------
* Linksys WAP4400N (firmware 1.2.17) with MARVELL 88W8361P-BEM1 chipset

Vulnerable Devices:
-------------------
* As it is a wireless driver specific issue, the wireless vendor should
use the latest chipset wireless driver for their access point firmwares.
This security vulnerability was originally reported to Linksys, updated
firmwares should be available on Cisco/Linksys web site. Any other
wireless device relying on this vulnerable wireless driver is likely to
be vulnerable.
