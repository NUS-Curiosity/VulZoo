Synopsis
========

An input sanitation error in PEAR Net_Traceroute might allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

Background
==========

PEAR Net_Traceroute is an OS independent wrapper class for executing
traceroute calls from PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                      /  Vulnerable  /          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-php/PEAR-Net_Traceroute      < 0.21.2               >= 0.21.2

Description
===========

Pasquale Imperato reported that the $host parameter to the traceroute()
function in Traceroute.php is not properly sanitized before being
passed to exec().

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability when user input is
passed directly to PEAR Net_Traceroute in a PHP script, possibly
resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary shell commands with the
privileges of the user running the affected PHP script.

Workaround
==========

Ensure that all data that is passed to the traceroute() function is
properly shell escaped (for instance using the escapeshellcmd()
function).

Resolution
==========

All PEAR Net_Traceroute users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
    ">=dev-php/PEAR-Net_Traceroute-0.21.2"
