Subject: VUPEN Security - Adobe Acrobat and Reader U3D Filter Code Execution Vulnerabilities

VUPEN Vulnerability Research - Adobe Acrobat and Reader U3D Filter Code 
Execution Vulnerabilities


I. BACKGROUND --------------------- 

Adobe Acrobat is a family of computer programs developed by Adobe
Systems, designed to view, create, manipulate and manage files in
Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF).


II. DESCRIPTION --------------------- 

VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team discovered three critical
vulnerabilities affecting Adobe Acrobat and Reader.

These vulnerabilities are caused by memory corruption errors within
the U3D filter when processing malformed data in a PDF file,
which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by tricking
a user into opening a specially crafted PDF document.
