CA20091008-01: Security Notice for CA Anti-Virus Engine


Issued: October 8, 2009


CA's support is alerting customers to multiple security risks 
associated with CA Anti-Virus Engine.  Vulnerabilities exist in 
the arclib component that can allow a remote attacker to cause a 
denial of service, or to cause heap corruption and potentially 
further compromise a system.  CA has issued fixes to address the 
vulnerabilities.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2009-3587, is due to improper 
handling of a specially crafted RAR archive file by the CA 
Anti-Virus engine arclib component.  An attacker can create a 
malformed RAR archive file that results in heap corruption and 
allows the attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly 
further compromise the system.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2009-3588, is due to improper 
handling of a specially crafted RAR archive file by the CA 
Anti-Virus engine arclib component.  An attacker can create a 
malformed RAR archive file that results in stack corruption and 
allows the attacker to cause a denial of service.

Non-Affected Products

CA Anti-Virus engine with arclib version 8.1.4.0 or later 
installed


How to determine if the installation is affected

For products on Windows:

1. Using Windows Explorer, locate the file "arclib.dll".  By 
   default, the file is located in the 
   "C:\Program Files\CA\SharedComponents\ScanEngine" directory (*).
2. Right click on the file and select Properties.
3. Select the Version tab.
4. If the file version is earlier than indicated below, the 
   installation is vulnerable.

      File Name     File Version
      arclib.dll    8.1.4.0

*For eTrust Intrusion Detection 2.0, the file is located in 
"Program Files\eTrust\Intrusion Detection\Common", and for eTrust 
Intrusion Detection 3.0 and 3.0 sp1, the file is located in 
"Program Files\CA\Intrusion Detection\Common".

For CA Anti-Virus r8.1 on non-Windows platforms:

Use the compver utility provided on the CD to determine the 
version of Arclib.  If the version is less than 8.1.4.0, the 
installation is vulnerable.

Example compver utility output:

      ------------------------------------------------
      COMPONENT NAME VERSION
      ------------------------------------------------
      eTrust Antivirus Arclib Archive Library 8.1.4.0
      ... (followed by other components)
                                       

For reference, the following are file names for arclib on 
non-Windows operating systems:

      Operating System     File name
      Solaris              libarclib.so
      Linux                libarclib.so
      Mac OS X             arclib.bundle


Solution

CA released arclib 8.1.4.0 on August 12 2009.  If your product is 
configured for automatic updates, you should already be protected, 
and you need to take no action.  If your product is not configured 
for automatic updates, then you simply need to run the update 
utility included with your product.

CA ARCserve for Linux:

1. Download RO10729.tar.Z from RO10729 into a temporary location 
   /tmp/RO10729

2. Uncompress and untar RO10729.tar.Z as follows:
   uncompress RO10729.tar.Z
   tar -xvf RO10729.tar
   The new "libarclib.so" will be extracted to /tmp/RO10729

3. Change the directory to $CAIGLBL0000/ino/config as follows:
   cd $CAIGLBL0000/ino/config

4. Rename "libarclib.so" to "libarclib.so.RO10729" as follows:
   mv libarclib.so libarclib.so.RO10729

5. Copy the new libarclib.so as follows:
   cp /tmp/RO10729/libarclib.so $CAIGLBL0000/ino/config/

6. chmod +x $CAIGLBL0000/ino/config/libarclib.so

7. Stop the common agent (caagent stop)

8. Change the directory to ARCserve common agent directory 
   (typically /opt/CA/BABcmagt)
   cd /opt/CA/BABcmagt
   Note: To find out the agent home directory run the following 
   command:
   dirname 'ls -l /usr/bin/caagent |cut -f2 -d">"'

9. Save a copy of libarclib.so
   cp -p libarclib.so libarclib.so.RO10729

10. Copy over the new libarclib.so as follows:
   cp $/tmp/RO10729/libarclib.so.

11. Start the common agent (caagent start)

12. Repeat steps (7-11) on all remote Linux client agents' 
   installations.

13. rm -rf /tmp/RO10729
