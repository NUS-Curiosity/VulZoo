Description:

By design, Jira Service Desk gives customer portal users permissions only to
raise requests and view issues. This allows users to interact with the customer
portal without having direct access to Jira. These restrictions can be bypassed
by a remote attacker with portal access who exploits a path traversal
vulnerability. Note that attackers can grant themselves access to Jira Service
Desk portals that have the Anyone can email the service desk or raise a request
in the portal setting enabled. Exploitation allows an attacker to view all
issues within all Jira projects contained in the vulnerable instance. This could
include Jira Service Desk projects, Jira Core projects, and Jira Software
projects.
Versions of Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center all versions before 3.9.17
(the fixed version for 3.9.x), from version 3.10.0 before 3.16.10 (the fixed
