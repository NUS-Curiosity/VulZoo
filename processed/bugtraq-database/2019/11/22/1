         CVE Name       CVE-2019-18790                                        

      Description     A SIP request can be sent to Asterisk that can change   
                      a SIP peer���s IP address. A REGISTER does not need to    
                      occur, and calls can be hijacked as a result. The only  
                      thing that needs to be known is the peer���s name;        
                      authentication details such as passwords do not need    
                      to be known. This vulnerability is only exploitable     
                      when the ���nat��� option is set to the default, or         
                      ���auto_force_rport���.                                     
    Modules Affected  channels/chan_sip.c                                     

    Resolution  Using any other option value for ���nat��� will prevent the       
                attack (such as ���nat=no��� or ���nat=force_rport���), but will      
                need to be tested on an individual basis to ensure that it    
                works for the user���s deployment. On the fixed versions of     
                Asterisk, it will no longer set the address of the peer       
                before authentication is successful when a SIP request comes  
                in.
