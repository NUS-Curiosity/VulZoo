Package        : haproxy
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-19330

Tim DÃ¼sterhus discovered that haproxy, a TCP/HTTP reverse proxy, did
not properly sanitize HTTP headers when converting from HTTP/2 to
HTTP/1. This would allow a remote user to perform CRLF injections.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.19-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.

For the detailed security status of haproxy please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy
