Subject: [Public Disclosure] Two Denial-of-Service vulnerabilities found in
 axTLS library (CVE-2019-9689 / CVE-2019-10013)

Hi all,

Two Denial-of-Service vulnerabilities were found in the axTLS library (http://axtls.sourceforge.net/). Both vulnerabilities were addressed to the project maintainer in a responsible disclosure.
Because the initial deadline was prolonged a few times to fix the issues, but we didn't received any feedback since June, the vulnerability details are published now: https://www.telekom.com/en/corporate-responsibility/data-protection-data-security/security/details/advisories-504842

Affected versions: axTLS <= 2.1.5

Detailed information about both vulnerabilities:
* CVE-2019-9689: https://www.telekom.com/resource/blob/586428/51ae062269fbcb068bd20379f87f1398/dl-191121-critical-remote-denial-of-service-vulnerability-ii--data.pdf
* CVE-2019-10013: https://www.telekom.com/resource/blob/586416/12097aeb8f9a6bba89a804b94575521a/dl-191121-critical-remote-denial-of-service-vulnerability-i--data.pdf
