Package        : git
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-1348 CVE-2019-1349 CVE-2019-1352 CVE-2019-1353
                 CVE-2019-1387 CVE-2019-19604

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in git, a fast, scalable,
distributed revision control system.

CVE-2019-1348

    It was reported that the --export-marks option of git fast-import is
    exposed also via the in-stream command feature export-marks=...,
    allowing to overwrite arbitrary paths.

CVE-2019-1387

    It was discovered that submodule names are not validated strictly
    enough, allowing very targeted attacks via remote code execution
    when performing recursive clones.

CVE-2019-19604

    Joern Schneeweisz reported a vulnerability, where a recursive clone
    followed by a submodule update could execute code contained within
    the repository without the user explicitly having asked for that. It
    is now disallowed for `.gitmodules` to have entries that set
    `submodule.<name>.update=!command`.

In addition this update addresses a number of security issues which are
only an issue if git is operating on an NTFS filesystem (CVE-2019-1349,
CVE-2019-1352 and CVE-2019-1353).

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:2.11.0-3+deb9u5.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.20.1-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.

tracker page at:
