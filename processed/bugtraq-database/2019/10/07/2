Package        : jackson-databind
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-12384 CVE-2019-14439 CVE-2019-14540 CVE-2019-16335 
                 CVE-2019-16942 CVE-2019-16943
Debian Bug     : 941530 940498 933393 930750

It was discovered that jackson-databind, a Java library used to parse
JSON and other data formats, did not properly validate user input
before attempting deserialization. This allowed an attacker providing
maliciously crafted input to perform code execution, or read arbitrary
files on the server.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.8.6-1+deb9u6.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.8-3+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.

For the detailed security status of jackson-databind please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/jackson-databind
