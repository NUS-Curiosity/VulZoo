         CVE Name       CVE-2019-13161                                        

    Description  When T.38 faxing is done in Asterisk a T.38 reinvite may be  
                 sent to an endpoint to switch it to T.38. If the endpoint    
                 responds with an improperly formatted SDP answer including   
                 both a T.38 UDPTL stream and an audio or video stream        
                 containing only codecs not allowed on the SIP peer or user   
                 a crash will occur. The code incorrectly assumes that there  
                 will be at least one common codec when T.38 is also in the   
                 SDP answer.                                                  
                                                                              
                 This requires Asterisk to initiate a T.38 reinvite which is  
                 only done when executing the ReceiveFax dialplan             
                 application or performing T.38 passthrough where a remote    
                 endpoint has requested T.38.                                 
                                                                              
                 For versions of Asterisk 13 before 13.21.0 and Asterisk 15   
                 before 15.4.0 the ���preferred_codec_only��� option must also    
                 be set to ���yes���. If set to ���no��� the crash will not occur.    

    Resolution  If T.38 faxing is not required this functionality can be      
                disabled by ensuring the ���t38pt_udptl��� is set to ���no��� so a    
                T.38 reinvite is not possible.                                
                                                                              
                If T.38 faxing is required then Asterisk should be upgraded   
                to a fixed version. The problem can also be limited in scope  
                by enabling T.38 faxing only for endpoints which actually     
                participate in fax.
