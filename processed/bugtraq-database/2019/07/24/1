Package        : neovim
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-12735

User "Arminius" discovered a vulnerability in Vim, an enhanced version of the
standard UNIX editor Vi (Vi IMproved), which also affected the Neovim fork, an
extensible editor focused on modern code and features:
  
Editors typically provide a way to embed editor configuration commands (aka
modelines) which are executed once a file is opened, while harmful commands
are filtered by a sandbox mechanism. It was discovered that the "source"
command (used to include and execute another file) was not filtered, allowing
shell command execution with a carefully crafted file opened in Neovim.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.1.7-4+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your neovim packages.

For the detailed security status of neovim please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/neovim
