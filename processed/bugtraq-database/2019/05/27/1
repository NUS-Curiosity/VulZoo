Package        : wpa
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-11555
Debian Bug     : 927463

A vulnerability was found in the WPA protocol implementation found in
wpa_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).

The EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server) and wpa_supplicant (EAP
peer) doesn't properly validate fragmentation reassembly state when receiving
an unexpected fragment. This could lead to a process crash due to a NULL
pointer derefrence.

An attacker in radio range of a station or access point with EAP-pwd support
could cause a crash of the relevant process (wpa_supplicant or hostapd),
ensuring a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.4-1+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.

For the detailed security status of wpa please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wpa
