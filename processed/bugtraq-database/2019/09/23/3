URL path traversal allows information disclosure - CVE-2019-14994

Severity:
Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical, according
to the scale published in our Atlassian severity levels. The scale allows us to
rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.
This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT
environment.


Description:

By design, Jira Service Desk gives customer portal users permissions only to
raise requests and view issues. This allows users to interact with the customer
portal without having direct access to Jira. These restrictions can be bypassed
by a remote attacker with portal access who exploits a path traversal
vulnerability. Exploitation allows an attacker to view all issues
within all Jira
projects contained in the vulnerable instance. This could include Jira Service
Desk projects, Jira Core projects, and Jira Software projects.

Note that attackers can grant themselves access to Jira Service Desk
portals that
have the 'Anyone can email the service desk or raise a request in the portal'
setting enabled. Changing this setting does not defend against an attacker that
has portal access via other means. Atlassian does not recommend changing the
setting. Instead, upgrade to a non-vulnerable version listed below.

Versions of Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center before 3.9.16 (the fixed
version for 3.9.x), from version 3.10.0 before 3.16.8 (the fixed version for
3.16.x), from version 4.0.0 before 4.1.3 (the fixed version for 4.1.x), from
version 4.2.0 before 4.2.5 (the fixed version for 4.2.x), from version 4.3.0
before 4.3.4 (the fixed version for 4.3.x), and from version 4.4.0 before 4.4.1
(the fixed version for 4.4.x) are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can
be tracked at: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-6517.
