Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
The dabman and imperial manufactured web radio series (typ d & i)
suffers from a weak password vulnerability.
The vulnerabilites allows local and remote attackers to compromise the
web radios full embedded linux busybox os.

The vulnerability is located within an undocumented telnet service
(telnetd) of the linux busybox and is
turned permanently on. The telnetd service uses weak passwords with
hardcoded credentials on the local embedded
linux busybox of the internet radio devices. The telnet password can be
cracked by usage of simple manual password
bruteforce technics or by basic automated attacks with scripts (exp.
ncrack). After receiving the password the
remote or local network attacker can unauthorized login to the internet
radio device to use the embedded linux
busybox operating system.

After the attacker has been logged in as root user, he can open the
/etc/ path to cat gshadow, shadow and the conf files.
At the end the attacker has finally full root access on the busybox
(telnetd), he can access the web-server (httpd) as
admin and see the wireless lan + unencrypted key in ./flash/ - wifi.cfg.
A demo exploit poc is available in the wild.

Vulnerable Protocol(s):
[+] telnetd

System(s):
[+] BusyBox v1.15.2 (2014-05-05 23:37:21 CST) built-in shell (ash)

1.2
The dabman and imperial manufactured web radio series (typ d & i)
suffers from a command execution vulnerability.
The vulnerability allows local and remote attackers unauthorized and
unauthenticated send commands to comprimise the web radio devices.

The vulnerability is located httpd web-server communcation on port 80
and 8080. Local and remote attackers can send basic GET
commands with basic command line tools (exp. curl or modhttp) to modify
or manipulate http requests. The attacker can also capture
the http airmusic commands to reverse engineer the radio device for
unauthorized interactions. The system has no protection mechanism
to block unauthorized transmit of commands. The web radio as well not
owns an auth or reminder mechanism to ensure only allowed or
trusted sources can transmit the commands (client, system, mac , auth ...).

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
A fresh updated version is available by the manufacturer telestar to
resolve the vulnerabilities in all i & d series products.
It is recommended to install the updates as quick as possible to ensure
the digital security.

1. Set the device to the factory setting
2. Select language
3. Switch off the device
4. Switch on the device
5. Network setup
6. Wait for "New Software" message
7. Press OK to start the update
8. Updated Version: TN81HH96-g102h-g103**a*-fb21a-3624


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the vulnerabilities in the online web radio with
wifi and user interface are estimated as critical.
The vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers in a network or by
remote attackers without user interaction or
further privileged user accounts. The potential of the issue being
exploited in thousends of end user devices all over europe
is estimated as high. The issue has the potential that could be used by
remote attackers for spreading randomware / malware,
mass defacements, compromises for further linux network attacks or being
part of a criminal acting iot botnet.
