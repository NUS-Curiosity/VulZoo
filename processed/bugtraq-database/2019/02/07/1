    data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability,
    which could lead to an out-of-bounds buffer read.

CVE-2019-3822

    Wenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team discovered that the function
    creating an outgoing NTLM type-3 header is subject to an integer
    overflow vulnerability, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write.

    Brian Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that the code handling
    the end-of-response for SMTP is subject to an out-of-bounds heap
