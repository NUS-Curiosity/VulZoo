A remote vulnerability was discovered on D-Link DIR-600M Wireless N
150 Home Router in multiple respective firmware versions.
The vulnerability provides unauthenticated remote access to the
router's WAN configuration page i.e. "wan.htm", which leads to
disclosure of sensitive user information including but not limited to
PPPoE, DNS configuration etc, also allowing to change
the configuration settings as well.
