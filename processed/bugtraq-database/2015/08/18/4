Package        : apache2
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3183 CVE-2015-3185
Debian Bug     : 794383

The security update from DSA-3325-1 caused a regression for the
oldstable distribution (wheezy). In some configurations, apache2 would
fail to start with a spurious error message about the certificate chain.
This update fixes this problem. For reference, the text of the original
advisory follows:


Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.

CVE-2015-3183

    An HTTP request smuggling attack was possible due to a bug in
    parsing of chunked requests. A malicious client could force the
    server to misinterpret the request length, allowing cache poisoning
    or credential hijacking if an intermediary proxy is in use.

CVE-2015-3185

    A design error in the "ap_some_auth_required" function renders the
    API unusuable in apache2 2.4.x. This could lead to modules using
    this API to allow access when they should otherwise not do so.
    The fix backports the new "ap_some_authn_required" API from 2.4.16.
    This issue does not affect the oldstable distribution (wheezy).


In addition, the updated package for the oldstable distribution (wheezy)
removes a limitation of the Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters to 1024 bits.
This limitation may potentially allow an attacker with very large
computing resources, like a nation-state, to break DH key exchange by
precomputation. The updated apache2 package also allows to configure
custom DH parameters. More information is contained in the
changelog.Debian.gz file.
These improvements were already present in the stable, testing, and
unstable distributions.


For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.2.22-13+deb7u6.

The other distributions were not affected by the regression.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.
