Package        : chrony
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-1821 CVE-2015-1822 CVE-2015-1853
Debian Bug     : 782160

Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat discovered multiple vulnerabilities in chrony,
an alternative NTP client and server:

CVE-2015-1821

    Using particular address/subnet pairs when configuring access control
    would cause an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2015-1822

    When allocating memory to save unacknowledged replies to authenticated
    command requests, a pointer would be left uninitialized, which could
    trigger an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2015-1853

    When peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric
    association, the internal state variables would be updated before the
    MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote
    attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization
    between NTP peers.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.24-3.1+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.30-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your chrony packages.
