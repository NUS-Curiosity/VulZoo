Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-2925 CVE-2015-5257 CVE-2015-5283 CVE-2015-7613

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, unauthorised
information disclosure or unauthorised information modification.

CVE-2015-2925

    Jann Horn discovered that when a subdirectory of a filesystem was
    bind-mounted into a chroot or mount namespace, a user that should
    be confined to that chroot or namespace could access the whole of
    that filesystem if they had write permission on an ancestor of
    the subdirectory.  This is not a common configuration for wheezy,
    and the issue has previously been fixed for jessie.

CVE-2015-5257

    Moein Ghasemzadeh of Istuary Innovation Labs reported that a USB
    device could cause a denial of service (crash) by imitating a
    Whiteheat USB serial device but presenting a smaller number of
    endpoints.

CVE-2015-5283

    Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered that creating multiple SCTP
    sockets at the same time could cause a denial of service (crash)
    if the sctp module had not previously been loaded.  This issue
    only affects jessie.

CVE-2015-7613

    Dmitry Vyukov discovered that System V IPC objects (message queues
    and shared memory segments) were made accessible before their
    ownership and other attributes were fully initialised.  If a local
    user can race against another user or service creating a new IPC
    object, this may result in unauthorised information disclosure,
    unauthorised information modification, denial of service and/or
    privilege escalation.

    A similar issue existed with System V semaphore arrays, but was
    less severe because they were always cleared before being fully
    initialised.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u5.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.3-1 or earlier versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
