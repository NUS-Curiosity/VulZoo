Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in qTranslate WordPress plugin, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against website administrators. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to gain complete control over the web application, if the victim visits a malicious page with XSS exploit. This vulnerability can also be used to perform drive-by-download or phishing attacks against website administrators. 

Input passed via "edit" HTTP GET parameter to "/wp-admin/options-general.php" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

A simple exploit below will display a JS popup with "ImmuniWeb" word:

http://wordpress/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=qtranslate&edit=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%2FImmuniWeb%2F%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E
