Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-3290 CVE-2015-3291 CVE-2015-4167 CVE-2015-5157
                 CVE-2015-5364 CVE-2015-5366

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.

CVE-2015-3290

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly
    handle nested NMIs. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-3291

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that under certain conditions a malicious
    userspace program can cause the kernel to skip NMIs leading to a
    denial of service.

CVE-2015-4167

    Carl Henrik Lunde discovered that the UDF implementation is missing
    a necessary length check. A local user that can mount devices could
    use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2015-5157

    Petr Matousek and Andy Lutomirski discovered that an NMI that
    interrupts userspace and encounters an IRET fault is incorrectly
    handled. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw for denial
    of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2015-5364

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
    cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid
    checksums.

CVE-2015-5366

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of
    service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single
    packet with an invalid checksum.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.8-2 or earlier versions.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
