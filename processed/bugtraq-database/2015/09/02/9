Package        : qemu

Debian Bug     : 793811 794610 795087 795461 796465

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor
emulator.

CVE-2015-3214

    Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw
    in the QEMU i8254 PIT emulation. A privileged guest user in a guest
    with QEMU PIT emulation enabled could potentially use this flaw to
    execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the
    hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-5154

    Kevin Wolf of Red Hat discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw in the
    IDE subsystem in QEMU while processing certain ATAPI commands. A
    privileged guest user in a guest with the CDROM drive enabled could
    potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with
    the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-5165

    Donghai Zhu discovered that the QEMU model of the RTL8139 network
    card did not sufficiently validate inputs in the C+ mode offload
    emulation, allowing a malicious guest to read uninitialized memory
    from the QEMU process's heap.

CVE-2015-5225

    Mr Qinghao Tang from QIHU 360 Inc. and Mr Zuozhi from Alibaba Inc
    discovered a buffer overflow flaw in the VNC display driver leading
    to heap memory corruption. A privileged guest user could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or
    potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
    privileges of the hosting QEMU process.

CVE-2015-5745

    A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way QEMU
    handles the virtio-serial device. A malicious guest could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u9. The oldstable distribution is only
affected by CVE-2015-5165 and CVE-2015-5745.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.4+dfsg-1a.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.
