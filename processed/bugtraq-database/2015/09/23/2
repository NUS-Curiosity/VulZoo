Vulnerability type: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Vulnerable version: 2.0.0-rev7 and earlier
Vulnerable component: guard
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 2.0.0-rev8
Vendor notification: 2015-07-28
Solution date: 2015-08-03
CVE reference: CVE-2015-5703
CVSSv2: 7.9 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:M/C:P/I:C/A:N/E:F/RL:U/RC:C/CDP:MH/TD:ND/CR:H/IR:H/AR:M)

Vulnerability Details:
A SQL injection vulnerability at the public key discovery API call has been identified that allows to execute arbitrary SQL statements in the context of the OX Guard database user. Valid user credentials are required to access this API and execute malicious statements.

Risk:
The vulnerability can be exploited to access confidential information like system configuration, mail addresses or other database content. Credentials are stored as salted hashes and PGP keys are stored encrypted. This makes it very expensive to extract plain-text data from it. There is no indicator that this vulnerability was been publicly known or exploited.

Solution:
Providers should update to Patch Release 2.0.0-rev8, or any later version.
