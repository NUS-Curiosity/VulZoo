 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:133
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : python-requests
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated python-requests packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Python-requests was found to have a vulnerability, where the attacker
 can retrieve the passwords from ~/.netrc file through redirect
 requests, if the user has their passwords stored in the ~/.netrc file
 (CVE-2014-1829).
 
 It was discovered that the python-requests Proxy-Authorization header
 was never re-evaluated when a redirect occurs. The Proxy-Authorization
 header was sent to any new proxy or non-proxy destination as redirected
 (CVE-2014-1830).
 
 In python-requests before 2.6.0, a cookie without a host value set
 would use the hostname for the redirected URL exposing requests
 users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie stealing
 (CVE-2015-2296).
