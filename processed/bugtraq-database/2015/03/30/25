Package        : dulwich
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9706 CVE-2015-0838
Debian Bug     : 780958 780989

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Dulwich, a Python
implementation of the file formats and protocols used by the Git version
control system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-9706

    It was discovered that Dulwich allows writing to files under .git/
    when checking out working trees. This could lead to the execution of
    arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an
    application based on Dulwich.

CVE-2015-0838

    Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team has found a buffer
    overflow in the C implementation of the apply_delta() function,
    used when accessing Git objects in pack files. An attacker could
    take advantage of this flaw to cause the execution of arbitrary
    code with the privileges of the user running a Git server or client
    based on Dulwich.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.5-2+deb7u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 0.9.7-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dulwich packages.
