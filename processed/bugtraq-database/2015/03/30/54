 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:126
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : sudo
 Date    : March 29, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated sudo packages fix security vulnerability:
 
 Prior to sudo 1.8.12, the TZ environment variable was passed through
 unchecked. Most libc tzset() implementations support passing
 an absolute pathname in the time zone to point to an arbitrary,
 user-controlled file. This may be used to exploit bugs in the C
 library&#039;s TZ parser or open files the user would not otherwise have
 access to. Arbitrary file access via TZ could also be used in a denial
 of service attack by reading from a file or fifo that will block
 (CVE-2014-9680).
 
 The sudo package has been updated to version 1.8.12, fixing this
 issue and several other bugs.
