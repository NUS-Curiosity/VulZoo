 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2015:173
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : ffmpeg
 Date    : March 30, 2015
 Affected: Business Server 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated ffmpeg packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 The tak_decode_frame function in libavcodec/takdec.c in FFmpeg before
 2.0.4 does not properly validate a certain bits-per-sample value, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
 array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted
 TAK (aka Tom&#039;s lossless Audio Kompressor) data (CVE-2014-2097).
 
 libavcodec/wmalosslessdec.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.4 uses an incorrect
 data-structure size for certain coefficients, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via crafted WMA data (CVE-2014-2098).
 
 The msrle_decode_frame function in libavcodec/msrle.c in FFmpeg before
 2.0.4 does not properly calculate line sizes, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access)
 or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Microsoft RLE
 video data (CVE-2014-2099).
 
 The mpegts_write_pmt function in the MPEG2 transport stream (aka DVB)
 muxer (libavformat/mpegtsenc.c) in FFmpeg before 2.0.4 allows remote
 attackers to have unspecified impact and vectors, which trigger an
 out-of-bounds write (CVE-2014-2263).
 
 An integer overflow in LZO decompression in FFmpeg before 2.0.5 allows
 remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by embedding compressed
 data in a video file (CVE-2014-4610).
 
 A heap-based buffer overflow in the encode_slice function in
 libavcodec/proresenc_kostya.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.6 can cause a
 crash, allowing a malicious image file to cause a denial of service
 (CVE-2014-5271).
 
 libavcodec/iff.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.6 allows an attacker to have
 an unspecified impact via a crafted iff image, which triggers an
 out-of-bounds array access, related to the rgb8 and rgbn formats
 (CVE-2014-5272).
 
 libavcodec/mjpegdec.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.6 considers only dimension
 differences, and not bits-per-pixel differences, when determining
 whether an image size has changed, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via crafted MJPEG data (CVE-2014-8541).
 
 libavcodec/utils.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.6 omits a certain codec ID
 during enforcement of alignment, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via crafted JV data (CVE-2014-8542).
 
 libavcodec/mmvideo.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.6 does not consider all lines
 of HHV Intra blocks during validation of image height, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access)
 or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted MM video data
 (CVE-2014-8543).
 
 libavcodec/tiff.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.6 does not properly validate
 bits-per-pixel fields, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (out-of-bounds access) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via crafted TIFF data (CVE-2014-8544).
 
 libavcodec/pngdec.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.6 accepts the monochrome-black
 format without verifying that the bits-per-pixel value is 1, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
 access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted PNG data
 (CVE-2014-8545).
 
 Integer underflow in libavcodec/cinepak.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.6 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access)
 or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Cinepak video
 data (CVE-2014-8546).
 
 libavcodec/gifdec.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.6 does not properly compute
 image heights, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (out-of-bounds access) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via crafted GIF data (CVE-2014-8547).
 
 Off-by-one error in libavcodec/smc.c in FFmpeg before 2.0.6 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Quicktime Graphics
 (aka SMC) video data (CVE-2014-8548).
 
 This updates provides ffmpeg version 2.0.6, which fixes these issues
 and several other bugs which were corrected upstream.
