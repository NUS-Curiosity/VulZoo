Debian Bug     : 781081

The openssl update issued as DSA 3197-1 caused regressions. This update
reverts the defective patch applied in that update causing these
problems. Additionally a follow-up fix for CVE-2015-0209 is applied.
For reference the original advisory text follows.

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:

CVE-2015-0286

    Stephen Henson discovered that the ASN1_TYPE_cmp() function
    can be crashed, resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2015-0287

    Emilia Kaesper discovered a memory corruption in ASN.1 parsing.

CVE-2015-0289

    Michal Zalewski discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the
    PKCS#7 parsing code, resulting in denial of service.

CVE-2015-0292

    It was discovered that missing input sanitising in base64 decoding
    might result in memory corruption.

CVE-2015-0209

    It was discovered that a malformed EC private key might result in
    memory corruption.

CVE-2015-0288

    It was discovered that missing input sanitising in the
    X509_to_X509_REQ() function might result in denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u16.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
