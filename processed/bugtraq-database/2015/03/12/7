Package        : libgcrypt11
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3591 CVE-2015-0837

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libgcrypt:

CVE-2014-3591

    The Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel
    attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext
    blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a
    quite noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.

CVE-2015-0837

    The modular exponentiation routine mpi_powm() was susceptible to a
    side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when
    accessing its internal pre-computed table.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.0-5+deb7u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your libgcrypt11 packages.
