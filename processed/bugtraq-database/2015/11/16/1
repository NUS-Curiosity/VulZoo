Subject: CVE-2015-6357: Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center SSL Validation Vulnerability

Title: Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center Certificate Validation Vulnerability

Blog URL: http://wadofstuff.blogspot.com.au/2015/11/cve-2015-6357-firepwner-exploit-for.html
Vendor: Cisco
Product: FireSIGHT Management Center
Affected Versions: 5.2.x, 5.3.x, 5.4.x
Advisory URL: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151116-fmc
CVE: CVE-2015-6357
CVSS: 5.1


The Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center appliance is used to manage Cisco
FirePOWER Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), also known as Sourcefire IPS.
FireSIGHT is responsible for downloading updated IPS signatures and installing
them on managed IPS devices.

On its own the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center Certificate Validation
Vulnerability is a medium severity vulnerability with a CVSS of 5.1.
However, this vulnerability is an example of why SSL certificate
validation is so
important. In this exploit I will demonstrate how the vulnerability
can be leveraged
to obtain privileged remote command execution on a Cisco FireSIGHT system. The
exploit chains the SSL validation vulnerability with the software update process
on the Cisco FireSIGHT system to trick the target system into
downloading a malicious
update and executing it to obtain a reverse shell with **root** privileges.
