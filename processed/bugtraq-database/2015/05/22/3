Potential Security Impact: Denial of Service (DoS), Execution of Arbitary
Code

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has identitfied with HP Helion OpenStack.
The

vulnerability could be exploited resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) or
execution of

arbitrary code.

Notes:

 - This is the vulnerability known as "Virtual Environment Neglected
Operations

Manipulation"also known as "VENOM".
 - This vulnerability exists in the floppy disk controller driver of QEMU, an
open-source

virtualization technology used to provision guest Virtual Machines.
 - This vulnerability affects all versions of QEMU and could lead to
hypervisor breakout,

where a user of the guest VM can gain control of the host. HP Helion
OpenStack leverages

QEMU as a core part of its virtualization functionality and is therefore
affected by this

vulnerability.
 - Due to the careful application of sVirt and AppArmor policies the
attacker's ability to

pivot after successfully exploiting the vulnerability is significantly
reduced.
