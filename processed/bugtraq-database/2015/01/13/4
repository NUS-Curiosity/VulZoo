Subject: MS14-080 CVE-2014-6365 Technical Details Without "Nonsense"

Origin:
Visit https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms14-080
Go to "Acknowledgments" part and search for "CVE-2014-6365"
It says "Dieyu" - that's me.

Technical Details:
"Internet Explorer XSS Filter Bypass Vulnerability" is done by...
1. Inject "a href" link into target page.
(Not script, allowed by filter)
2. User clicks this injected link.
(Clickjacking etc)
3. URL of this injected link puts script into page.
(Filter does not kill it)
(Because it's transaction of the same domain)
