Subject: Blubrry PowerPress Security Advisory - XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2015-1385

Information
------------
Advisory by Netsparker
Name: XSS Vulnerability in Blubrry PowerPress
Affected Software : Blubrry PowerPress
Affected Versions: 6.0 and possibly below
Vendor Homepage : https://wordpress.org/plugins/powerpress/
Vulnerability Type : Cross-site Scripting
Severity : Important
CVE-ID: CVE-2015-1385
Netsparker Advisory Reference : NS-15-001

Description
-----------
By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can
hijack a logged in user?s session. This means that the malicious
hacker can change the logged in user?s password and invalidate the
session of the victim while the hacker maintains access. As seen from
the XSS example in this article, if a web application is vulnerable to
cross-site scripting and the administrator?s session is hijacked, the
malicious hacker exploiting the vulnerability will have full admin
privileges on that web application.

Netsparker finds and reports security issues and vulnerabilities such
as SQL Injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in all websites and
web applications regardless of the platform and the technology they
are built on. Netsparker's unique detection and exploitation
techniques allows it to be dead accurate in reporting hence it's the
first and the only False Positive Free web application security
scanner.
