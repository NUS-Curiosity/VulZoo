Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6885 CVE-2014-8133 CVE-2014-9419 CVE-2014-9529 
                 CVE-2014-9584

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2013-6885

    It was discovered that under specific circumstances, a combination
    of write operations to write-combined memory and locked CPU
    instructions may cause a core hang on AMD 16h 00h through 0Fh
    processors. A local user can use this flaw to mount a denial of
    service (system hang) via a crafted application.

    For more information please refer to the AMD CPU erratum 793 in
    http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/51810_16h_00h-0Fh_Rev_Guide.pdf

CVE-2014-8133

    It was found that the espfix funcionality can be bypassed by
    installing a 16-bit RW data segment into GDT instead of LDT (which
    espfix checks for) and using it for stack. A local unprivileged user
    could potentially use this flaw to leak kernel stack addresses and
    thus allowing to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

CVE-2014-9419

    It was found that on Linux kernels compiled with the 32 bit
    interfaces (CONFIG_X86_32) a malicious user program can do a
    partial ASLR bypass through TLS base addresses leak when attacking
    other programs.

CVE-2014-9529

    It was discovered that the Linux kernel is affected by a race
    condition flaw when doing key garbage collection, allowing local
    users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic).

CVE-2014-9584

    It was found that the Linux kernel does not validate a length value
    in the Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field, which allows
    local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a
    crafted iso9660 image.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.65-1+deb7u1. Additionally this update fixes a suspend/resume
regression introduced with 3.2.65.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
