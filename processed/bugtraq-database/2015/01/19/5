Subject: CVE-2015-1032 Kiwix Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

CVE-2015-1032

A cross-site scripting vulnerability in the "Kiwix" zim file reader was
discovered by Emmanuel Engelhart on 31 October 2014, and was reported on
Sourceforge here: http://sourceforge.net/p/kiwix/bugs/763/

This vulnerability does not affect most users of the program, only those
using the "kiwix-serve" binary to allow zim files to be read over a network.

Input to the search bar was not sanitised, thus allowing arbitrary
javascript code to be sent via servers running this program.

This vulnerability was fixed by Emmanuel Engelhart on 8 January 2015
with this commit:
