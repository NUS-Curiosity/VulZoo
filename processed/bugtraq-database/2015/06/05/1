Package        : libapache-mod-jk
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8111
Debian Bug     : 783233

An information disclosure flaw due to incorrect JkMount/JkUnmount
directives processing was found in the Apache 2 module mod_jk to forward
requests from the Apache web server to Tomcat. A JkUnmount rule for a
subtree of a previous JkMount rule could be ignored. This could allow a
remote attacker to potentially access a private artifact in a tree that
would otherwise not be accessible to them.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.2.37-1+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.37-4+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.2.40+svn150520-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.40+svn150520-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-jk packages.
