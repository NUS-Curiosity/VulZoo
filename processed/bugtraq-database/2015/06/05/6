CA20150604-01: Security Notice for CA Common Services

Issued: June 4, 2015

CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to multiple potential
risks with products that bundle CA Common Services on Unix/Linux
platforms. A local attacker may exploit these vulnerabilities to
gain additional privileges. 

The first vulnerability, CVE-2015-3316, occurs due to insecure use of
an environment variable which may enable a local attacker to gain
privileged access.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2015-3317, occurs due to multiple
instances of insufficient bounds checking which can potentially
allow a local attacker to gain privileged access.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2015-3318, occurs due to inadequate
validation of a variable which can possibly allow a local attacker
to gain privileged access.
