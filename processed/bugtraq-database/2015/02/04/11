Dear Mathew M.,

This is for information security department and developer who develop the firmware 
for ASUS router,
Issue

The value of the flag request parameter is copied into a JavaScript string which is 
encapsulated in single quotation marks. The payload 78846';alert(1337)//372137b5d 
was submitted in the flag parameter. This input was echoed unmodified in the 
application's response.


Please find attached POC for the details of concept and Please revert on priority and 
register a CVE ID for Same, I am planing to submit the same to 
https://forms.cert.org/VulReport/ for making this Public once got confirmation from 
your side
