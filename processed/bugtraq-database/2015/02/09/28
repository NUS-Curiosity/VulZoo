Package        : ntp
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9297

Marc Deslauriers reported that the patch applied to ntp for CVE-2014-9297
in DSA 3154-1 was incomplete. This update corrects that problem. For
reference, the relevant part of the original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the ntp package, an
implementation of the Network Time Protocol. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-9297

    Stephen Roettger of the Google Security Team, Sebastian Krahmer of
    the SUSE Security Team and Harlan Stenn of Network Time Foundation
    discovered that the length value in extension fields is not properly
    validated in several code paths in ntp_crypto.c, which could lead to
    information leakage or denial of service (ntpd crash).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.
