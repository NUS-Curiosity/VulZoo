4. Affected Components Description
==================================

Business Objects is part of the Business Intelligence platform from SAP.
It has components that provide performance management, planning,
reporting, query and analysis and enterprise information management.

Every Business Objects installation provides a web service to interact
with different platform services.


5. Vulnerability Details
========================

The BusinessObjects File Repositoy Server (FRS) CORBA listener allows a
user to read any file stored in the FRS without authentication. The only
requirement is that the user know the name of the file in the FRS. For
example, "Âfrs://Input/a_103/019/000/4967/1b14796c5b0d5f2c.rpt"Â. With
knowledge of this filename, the user can read the file remotely without
authentication.

Note, using CORBA it also possible to test if a directory or file exists
on the file system. Therefore, although unlikely, an attacker could
guess directories and then filenames to brute-force file locations. This
would be considerably easier with a predictable file naming convention.


6. Solution
===========

SAP has released SAP Note 2018682 which provides patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2018682
Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
