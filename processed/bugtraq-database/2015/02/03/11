Package        : unzip
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-9636
Debian Bug     : 776589

A flaw was found in the test_compr_eb() function allowing out-of-bounds
read and write access to memory locations. By carefully crafting a
corrupt ZIP archive an attacker can trigger a heap overflow, resulting
in application crash or possibly having other unspecified impact.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0-8+deb7u2. Additionally this update corrects a defective
patch applied to address CVE-2014-8139, which caused a regression with
executable jar files.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0-15. The defective patch applied to address CVE-2014-8139 was
corrected in version 6.0-16.

We recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.
