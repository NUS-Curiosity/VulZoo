WORKAROUND INSTRUCTIONS

HP recommends following this information after applying the updates to
protect against potential risk for the specified HP IceWall products.

HP IceWall SSO Dfw

The AGENT_PERMIT configuration parameter allows Dfw to restrict requests from
the Agent (another module) by using one of following methods: IP (IP
address), HOST(host name) and DOMAIN (domain name).
If possible, do not specify the "IP" value as the evaluation method in
setting AGENT_PERMIT. Instead, use "HOST" or "DOMAIN". Dfw calls the
gethostbyname() function only if the "IP" method is specified.

Note: The HP IceWall product is only available in Japan.
