HPSBST02896 rev.1 - HP StoreVirtual Storage, Remote Unauthorized Access

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon as
soon as possible.

Release Date: 2013-07-09

Potential Security Impact: Remote unauthorized access

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with the HP
StoreVirtual Storage. This vulnerability could be remotely exploited to gain
unauthorized access to the device.

All HP StoreVirtual Storage systems are equipped with a mechanism that allows
HP support to access the underlying operating system if permission and access
is provided by the customer. This functionality cannot be disabled today.

HP has acknowledged this vulnerability and will provide a patch that will
allow customers to disable the support access mechanism on or before July 17,
2013.

HP StoreVirtual products are storage appliances that use a custom operating
system, LeftHand OS, which is not accessible to the end user. Limited access
is available to the user via the HP StoreVirtual Command-Line Interface
(CLiQ) however root access is blocked.

Root access may be requested by HP Support in some cases to help customers
resolve complex support issues. To facilitate these cases, a
challenge-response-based one-time password utility is employed by HP Support
to gain root access to systems when the customer has granted permission and
network access to the system. The one-time password utility protects the root
access to prevent repeated access to the system with the same pass phrase.
Root access to the LeftHand OS does not provide access to the user data being
stored on the system.

References: CVE-2013-2352 (SSRT101257)

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.
This issue effects LeftHand OS (a.k.a. SAN iQ) software versions 10.5 and
earlier.
