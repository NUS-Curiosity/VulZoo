Package        : xorg-server
Vulnerability  : information disclosure
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1940

David Airlie and Peter Hutterer of Red Hat discovered that xorg-server,
the Xorg X server was vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw
related to input handling and devices hotplug.

When an X server is running but not on front (for example because of a VT
switch), a newly plugged input device would still be recognized and
handled by the X server, which would actually transmit input events to
its clients on the background.

This could allow an attacker to recover some input events not intended
for the X clients, including sensitive information.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.7.7-16.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.4-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.4-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.
