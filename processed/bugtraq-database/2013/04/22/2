Package        : curl
Vulnerability  : exposure of sensitive information
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1944
Debian Bug     : 705274

Yamada Yasuharu discovered that cURL, an URL transfer library, is
vulnerable to expose potentially sensitive information when doing
requests across domains with matching tails. Due to a bug in the
tailmatch function when matching domain names, it was possible that
cookies set for a domain 'ample.com' could accidentally also be sent
by libcurl when communicating with 'example.com'.

Both curl the command line tool and applications using the libcurl
library are vulnerable.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.29.0-2.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
