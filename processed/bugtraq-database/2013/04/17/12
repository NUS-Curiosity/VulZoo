Subject: Re: [SE-2012-01] Details of issues fixed by Java SE 7 Update 21


Hello All,

We wanted to add the following information to our yesterday post.

We've learned that RedHat's Bugzilla associates CVE-2013-1537 [1]
with the RMI issue allowing for a remote loading and execution of
arbitrary Java code on servers [2].

It looks that Oracle has finally patched RMI vulnerability that
was known to the vendor since 2005. What's also interesting is
that a fix for it is now highlighted by Oracle as a new security
feature of Java [3].

We can't decide what is more surprising to us:
1) finding out that Oracle finally admitted that Java security
    issues could affect servers as well (so far the Plugin was
    the source of all evilness),
2) learning that at Oracle, "every developer is a security
    rifleman", "trained on security" [4].

Thank you.

Best Regards,
Adam Gowdiak
