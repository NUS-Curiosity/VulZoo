 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:050
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : nss
 Date    : April 5, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Google reported to Mozilla that TURKTRUST, a certificate authority in
 Mozillas root program, had mis-issued two intermediate certificates
 to customers. The issue was not specific to Firefox but there was
 evidence that one of the certificates was used for man-in-the-middle
 (MITM) traffic management of domain names that the customer did not
 legitimately own or control. This issue was resolved by revoking the
 trust for these specific mis-issued certificates (CVE-2013-0743).
 
 The rootcerts package has been upgraded to address this flaw and the
 Mozilla NSS package has been rebuilt to pickup the changes.
 
 The TLS implementation in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) does
 not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a noncompliant
 MAC check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding,
 which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and
 plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data
 for crafted packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169 (CVE-2013-1620).
 
 The NSPR package has been upgraded to the 4.9.5 version due to
 dependecies of newer NSS.
 
 The NSS package has been upgraded to the 3.14.3 version which is not
 vulnerable to this issue.
 
 The sqlite3 update addresses a crash when using svn commit after
 export MALLOC_CHECK_=3.
