I. BACKGROUND
---------------------

Adobe Flash Player is a cross-platform browser-based application runtime
that delivers viewing of expressive applications, content, and videos
across screens and browsers. It is installed on 98% of computers.


II. DESCRIPTION
---------------------

VUPEN Vulnerability Research Team discovered a critical vulnerability
in Adobe Flash Player.

The vulnerability is caused by an object confusion error when processing
malformed Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) data received during the
initial phase of communication with a server, which could be exploited
by remote attackers to compromise a vulnerable system via a malicious
web page.


III. AFFECTED PRODUCTS
---------------------------

Adobe Flash Player versions prior to 11.7.700.169


IV. Binary Analysis & Exploits/PoCs
---------------------------------------

In-depth technical analysis of the vulnerability and a fully functional
remote code execution exploit are available through the VUPEN BAE
(Binary Analysis & Exploits) portal:

allows security vendors (IPS, IDS, AntiVirus) to supplement their internal
research efforts and quickly develop both vulnerability-based and
exploit-based signatures to proactively protect their customers from attacks
and emerging threats.
