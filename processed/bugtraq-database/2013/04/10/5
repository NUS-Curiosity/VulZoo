 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:097
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libotr
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability was found and corrected in libotr:
 
 Just Ferguson discovered that libotr, an off-the-record (OTR) messaging
 library, can be forced to perform zero-length allocations for heap
 buffers that are used in base64 decoding routines. An attacker can
 exploit this flaw by sending crafted messages to an application that
 is using libotr to perform denial of service attacks or potentially
 execute arbitrary code (CVE-2012-3461).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.
