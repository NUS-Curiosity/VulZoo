 (advReplicationAdmin) (CVE-2013-0355)

Hash: SHA1

Cross-site scripting in Oracle Enterprise Manager (advReplicationAdmin)

TeamSHATTER Security Advisory

February 20, 2013

Risk Level:
High

Affected versions:
Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Control 11.1.0.7, 11.2.0.2, 11.2.0.3

Remote exploitable:
Yes

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martinez Fayo of
Application Security Inc.

Details:
Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities occur when an attacker tricks a
legitimate web application into sending malicious code, generally in the form
of a script, to an unsuspecting end user. The attack usually involves crafting
a hyperlink with malicious script code embedded within it. A valid user is
likely to click this link since it points to a resource on a trusted domain.
The link can be posted on a web page, or sent in an instant message, or email.
Clicking on the link executes the attacker-injected code in the context of the
trusted web application. Typically, the code steals session cookies, which can
then be used to impersonate a valid user.
There are instances of XSS vulnerabilities in the Distributed/Cross DB
Features of Oracle Enterprise Manager.  For example web page
/em/console/database/dist/advRepl/advReplicationAdmin is vulnerable to this
kind of attacks.

Impact:
Attackers might steal administrator's session cookies, thereby allowing the
attacker to impersonate the valid user.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

Fix:
Apply January 2013 CPU.
