APPLE-SA-2013-01-28-2 Apple TV 5.2

Apple TV 5.2 is now available and addresses the following:

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 2nd generation and later
Impact:  A user-mode process may be able to access the first page of
kernel memory
Description:  The kernel has checks to validate that the user-mode
pointer and length passed to the copyin and copyout functions would
not result in a user-mode process being able to directly access
kernel memory. The checks were not being used if the length was
smaller than one page. This issue was addressed through additional
validation of the arguments to copyin and copyout.
CVE-ID
CVE-2013-0964 : Mark Dowd of Azimuth Security

Apple TV
Available for:  Apple TV 2nd generation
Impact:  A remote attacker on the same WiFi network may be able to

Description:  An out of bounds read issue exists in Broadcom's
BCM4325 and BCM4329 firmware's handling of 802.11i information
elements. This issue was addressed through additional validation of
802.11i information elements.
