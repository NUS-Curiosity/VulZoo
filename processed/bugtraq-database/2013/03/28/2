          CVE Name        CVE-2013-2264                                       

    Description  When authenticating via SIP with alwaysauthreject enabled,   
                 allowguest disabled, and autocreatepeer disabled, Asterisk   
                 discloses whether a user exists for INVITE, SUBSCRIBE, and   
                 REGISTER transactions in multiple ways.                      
                                                                              
                 This information was disclosed:                              
                                                                              
                 * when a "407 Proxy Authentication Required" response was    
                 sent instead of "401 Unauthorized" response.                 
                                                                              
                 * due to the presence or absence of additional tags at the   
                 end of "403 Forbidden" such as "(Bad auth)".                 
                                                                              
                 * when a "401 Unauthorized" response was sent instead of     
                 "403 Forbidden" response after a retransmission.             
                                                                              
                 * when retransmissions were sent when a matching peer did    
                 not exist, but were not when a matching peer did exist.      

    Resolution  This issue can only be mitigated by upgrading to versions of  
                Asterisk that contain the patch or applying the patch.
