Subject: CVE-2013-3724 Monkey HTTPD 1.1.1 - Denial of Service Vulnerability

1. Title

   CVE-2013-3724 Monkey HTTPD 1.1.1 - Denial of Service Vul-
   nerability

2. Introduction

   Monkey is a  lightweight  and  powerful  web  server  for
   GNU/Linux.

   It  has been designed to be very scalable with low memory
   and CPU consumption, the perfect  solution  for  embedded
   devices. Made for ARM, x86 and x64.


3. Abstract

   The  vulnerability is a denial of service which is caused
   by sending a null byte in an  HTTP  request  to  the  web
   server.

6. Affected Products

      Monkey HTTPD 1.1.1

7. Exploitation Technique

      Remote

8. Details

      A  bug  discovered  in  Monkey's HTTP parser allows an
      attacker to cause a segmentation fault in one  of  the
      daemon's  threads  using  a  specially crafted request
      containing a null byte. An attacker can crash all  the
      available  threads  by  sending  the specially crafted
      request multiple times, rendering the  server  useless
      for legitimate users.

9. Proof of Concept

      The  vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker
      without any special privileges. The placement  of  the
      null byte within the request does not seem to have any
      effect on the result. The null byte may even  be  used
      instead  of  an  HTTP method such as, GET. Below is an
      example of how this bug can be manually triggered:


     ruby -e 'puts "GET /\x00 HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n"'|netcat localhost 2001


10. Solution

   This vulnerability has been fixed for the 1.2.0 release.

11. Risk

   The security risk of the DoS vulnerability  is  estimated
   as low.
