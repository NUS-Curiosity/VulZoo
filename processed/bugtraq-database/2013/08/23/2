                   VMware Security Advisory

Advisory ID: VMSA-2013-0010
Synopsis:    VMware Workstation host privilege escalation vulnerability
Issue date:  2013-08-22
Updated on:  2013-08-22 (initial advisory)
CVE numbers: CVE-2013-1662

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware Workstation and VMware Player address a vulnerability in the
   vmware-mount component which could result in a privilege escalation
   on linux-based host machines.

2. Relevant releases

   VMware Workstation 9.x
   VMware Workstation 8.x
    
   VMware Player 5.x
   VMware Player 4.x

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware mount privilege escalation

      VMware Workstation and Player contain a vulnerability in the
      handling of the vmware-mount command. A local malicious user may
      exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges to root on
      the host OS. The issue is present when Workstation or Player are
      installed on a Debian-based version of Linux.

      The vulnerability does not allow for privilege escalation from the
      Guest Operating System to the host or vice-versa. This means that
      host memory can not be manipulated from the Guest Operating
      System.

      Workaround
      A workaround for the issue is to remove the setuid bit from
      vmware-mount:
     
      # chmod u-s /usr/bin/vmware-mount
     
      This workaround is relevant for both Workstation and Player.

      VMware would like to thank Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security
      Team for reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
