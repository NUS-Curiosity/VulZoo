 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:208
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libtiff
 Date    : August 6, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated libtiff packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tiff2pdf of
 libtiff performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF
 document file, in the tp_process_jpeg_strip() function. A remote
 attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file,
 that when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable
 crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges
 of the user running the tiff2pdf binary (CVE-2013-1960).
 
 A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way tiff2pdf of libtiff
 performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF document
 file, when malformed image-length and resolution values are used in
 the TIFF file. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
 TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would lead
 to tiff2pdf executable crash (CVE-2013-1961).
