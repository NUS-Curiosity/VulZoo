APPLE-SA-2013-09-26-1 iOS 7.0.2

iOS 7.0.2 is now available and addresses the following:

Passcode Lock
Available for:  iPhone 4 and later
Impact:  A person with physical access to the device may be able to
make calls to any number
Description:  A NULL dereference existed in the lock screen which
would cause it to restart if the emergency call button was tapped
repeatedly. While the lock screen was restarting, the call dialer
could not get the lock screen state and assumed the device was
unlocked, and so allowed non-emergency numbers to be dialed. This
issue was addressed by avoiding the NULL dereference.
CVE-ID
CVE-2013-5160 : Karam Daoud of PART - Marketing & Business
Development, Andrew Chung, Mariusz Rysz

Passcode Lock
Available for:  iPhone 4 and later,
iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
Impact:  A person with physical access to the device may be able to
see recently used apps, see, edit, and share photos
Description:  The list of apps you opened could be accessed during
some transitions while the device was locked, and the Camera app
could be opened while the device was locked.
CVE-ID
CVE-2013-5161 : videosdebarraquito
