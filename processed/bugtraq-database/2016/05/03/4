Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2105 CVE-2016-2106 CVE-2016-2107 CVE-2016-2108 
                 CVE-2016-2109 CVE-2016-2176

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer
toolkit.

CVE-2016-2105

    Guido Vranken discovered that an overflow can occur in the function
    EVP_EncodeUpdate(), used for Base64 encoding, if an attacker can
    supply a large amount of data. This could lead to a heap corruption.

CVE-2016-2106

    Guido Vranken discovered that an overflow can occur in the function
    EVP_EncryptUpdate() if an attacker can supply a large amount of data.
    This could lead to a heap corruption.

CVE-2016-2107

    Juraj Somorovsky discovered a padding oracle in the AES CBC cipher
    implementation based on the AES-NI instruction set. This could allow
    an attacker to decrypt TLS traffic encrypted with one of the cipher
    suites based on AES CBC.

CVE-2016-2108

    David Benjamin from Google discovered that two separate bugs in the
    ASN.1 encoder, related to handling of negative zero integer values
    and large universal tags, could lead to an out-of-bounds write.

CVE-2016-2109

    Brian Carpenter discovered that when ASN.1 data is read from a BIO
    using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio(), a short invalid encoding can
    casuse allocation of large amounts of memory potentially consuming
    excessive resources or exhausting memory.

CVE-2016-2176

    Guido Vranken discovered that ASN.1 Strings that are over 1024 bytes
    can cause an overread in applications using the X509_NAME_oneline()
    function on EBCDIC systems. This could result in arbitrary stack data
    being returned in the buffer.

Additional information about these issues can be found in the OpenSSL
security advisory at https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-3+deb8u5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2h-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.
