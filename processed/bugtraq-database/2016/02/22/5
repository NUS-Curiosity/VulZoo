Hash: SHA256

CVE-2016-0706 Apache Tomcat Security Manager bypass

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- - Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.44
- - Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.67
- - Apache Tomcat 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.30
- - Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1
- - Earlier, unsupported Tomcat versions may be affected

Description:
The StatusManagerServlet could be loaded by a web application when a
security manager was configured. This servlet would then provide the web
application with a list of all deployed applications and a list of the
HTTP request lines for all requests currently being processed. This
could have exposed sensitive information from other web applications
such as session IDs to the web application.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M3 or later
  (9.0.0.M2 has the fix but was not released)
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.0.32 or later
  (8.0.31 has the fix but was not released)
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.68 or later
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 6.0.45 or later
