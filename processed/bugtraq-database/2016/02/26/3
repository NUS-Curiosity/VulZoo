CVE-2016-0729: Apache Xerces-C XML Parser Crashes on Malformed Input

Severity: Critical

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Apache Xerces-C XML Parser library versions prior to V3.1.3

Description: The Xerces-C XML parser mishandles certain kinds of malformed input documents, resulting in buffer overlows during processing and error reporting. The overflows can manifest as a segmentation fault or as memory corruption during a parse operation. The bugs allow for a denial of service attack in many applications by an unauthenticated attacker, and could conceivably result in remote code execution.

Mitigation: Applications that are using library versions older than
V3.1.3 should upgrade as soon as possible. Distributors of older versions should apply the patches from this subversion revision:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1727978

Credit: This issue was reported by Gustavo Grieco.
