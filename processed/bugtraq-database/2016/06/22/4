Subject: Open-Xchange Security Advisory 2016-06-22

Product: OX App Suite
Vendor: OX Software GmbH

Internal reference: 45328 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Vulnerable version: 7.8.1 and earlier
Vulnerable component: frontend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 7.6.2-rev43, 7.6.3-rev11, 7.8.0-rev23, 7.8.1-rev10
Vendor notification: 2016-04-14
Solution date: 2016-05-10
Public disclosure: 2016-06-22
CVE reference: CVE-2016-4027
CVSS: 2.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
App Suite frontend offers to control whether a user wants to store cookies that exceed the session duration. This functionality is useful when logging in from clients with reduced privileges or shared environments. However the setting was incorrectly recognized and cookies were stored regardless of this setting when the login was performed using a non-interactive login method. In case the setting was enforced by middleware configuration or the user went through the interactive login page, the workflow was correct.

Risk:
Cookies with authentication information may become available to other users on shared environments. In case the user did not properly log out from the session, third parties with access to the same client can access a users account.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Use token-login to forward a client with authentication credentials
2. Within the login string, set the "store" parameter to "false"
3. Observe the cookie settings for the client

Solution:
Users should always logout from their session when not using the application for a extended period of time. Operators and users can enable automatic log-out. Operators should deploy the latest Patch Release.



Affected product: OX Guard
Internal reference: 45292 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: Information Exposure (CWE-209)
Vulnerable version: 2.4.0
Vulnerable component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed versions: 2.4.0-rev8
Vendor notification: 2016-04-13
Solution date: 2016-04-21
Public disclosure: 2016-06-22
CVE reference: CVE-2016-4028
CVSS: 4.4 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
OX Guard uses an authentication token to identify and transfer guest users credentials. The OX Guard API acts as a padding oracle by responding with different error codes depending on wheather the provided token matches the encryption padding. In combination with AES-CBC, this allows attackers for guess the correct padding.

Risk:
Attackers may run brute-forcing attacks on the content of the guest authentication token and discover user credentials. For a practical attack vector, the guest users needs to have logged in, the content of the guest users "OxReaderID" cookie and the value of the "auth" parameter needs to be known to the attacker.

Solution:
The API now delivers consistent responses regardless if the padding has been successfully guessed. This will mitigate the attack vector. Future releases may remove usage of AES-CBC to solve the root-cause completely. Operators should deploy the latest Patch Release.

CVE reference: CVE-2016-4026
CVSS: 3.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
The content sanitizer component has an issue with filtering malicious content in case invalid HTML code is provided. In such cases the filter will output a unsanitized representation of the content.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). Attackers can use this issue for filter evasion to inject script code later on.

Solution:
Users should not open content from untrusted sources, to safeguard the client-side, HTTP headers like CSP can be set. Users should enable the XSS protection feature of their browsers. Operators should deploy the latest Patch Release.



Affected product: OX App Suite
Internal reference: 45295 (Bug ID)
Vulnerability type: Cross Site Scripting (CWE-80)
Vulnerable version: 7.6.3 and earlier
Vulnerable component: middleware
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by Vendor
Fixed version: 7.6.2-rev54, 7.6.3-rev11, 7.8.0-rev30, 7.8.1-rev11
Vendor notification: 2016-04-13
Solution date: 2016-05-10
Public disclosure: 2016-06-22
CVE reference: CVE-2016-4026
CVSS: 3.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
In case the legacy AJP connector is used (available till 7.6.3), a specific error case can be used to execute script conde in the users context. A file needs to be uploaded to Drive and its MIME-Type needs to be altered in a way that it passes the syntax check but triggers an error while processing the download. In case of this event, the related error page reflects the file name to the requesting client. If a attacker has also renamed the file name in a way that it contains script code, that code gets executed. When using the recent Grizzly connector, this vulnerability does not occur since the response is part of the header. Even though we changed the code to avoid returning user input with HTTP headers when using Grizzly.

Risk:
Malicious script code can be executed within a users context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.). The attacker needs to reside within the same context to make this attack work.

Solution:
Users should not open links from untrusted sources, to safeguard the client-side, HTTP headers like CSP can be set. Users should enable the XSS protection feature of their browsers. Operators should deploy the latest Patch Release.

CVE reference: CVE-2016-4048
CVSS: 4.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

Vulnerability Details:
Custom messages can be shown at the login screen to notify external users about issues with sharing links. This mechanism can be abused to inject arbitrary text messages.

Risk:
Users may get tricked to follow instructions injected by third parties as part of social engineering attacks.

Solution:
Users should not open links from untrusted sources or follow instructions regarding their credentials. We changed the behaviour in a way that the client is now required to provide a token in order to get a specific message shown at the login screen. Operators should deploy the latest Patch Release.
