Subject: Re: [CVE-2016-1919] Weak eCryptFS Key generation from user
 password on KNOX 1.0 / Android 4.3

Vendor Response Continuation
============================
KNOX 2.0 fixes the issue. KNOX 2.3 makes some further improvements (with the introduction of Sensitive Data Protection), but even KNOX 2.0 has a different key derivation scheme.
