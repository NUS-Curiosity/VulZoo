Package        : fuseiso
CVE ID         : CVE-2015-8836 CVE-2015-8837
Debian Bug     : 779047

It was discovered that fuseiso, a user-space implementation of the
ISO 9660 file system based on FUSE, contains several vulnerabilities.

CVE-2015-8836

    A stack-based buffer overflow may allow attackers who can trick a
    user into mounting a crafted ISO 9660 file system to cause a
    denial of service (crash), or, potentially, execute arbitrary
    code.

CVE-2015-8837

    An integer overflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow, which
    allows an attacker (who can trick a user into mounting a crafted
    ISO 9660 file system) to cause a denial of service (crash), or,
    potentially, execute arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 20070708-3+deb7u1.

The stable distribution (jessie) does not contain fuseiso packages.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 20070708-3.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your fuseiso packages.
