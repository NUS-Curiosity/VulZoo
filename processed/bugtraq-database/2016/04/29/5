Package        : subversion
CVE ID         : CVE-2016-2167 CVE-2016-2168

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control
system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2016-2167

    Daniel Shahaf and James McCoy discovered that an implementation
    error in the authentication against the Cyrus SASL library would
    permit a remote user to specify a realm string which is a prefix of
    the expected realm string and potentially allowing a user to
    authenticate using the wrong realm.

CVE-2016-2168

    Ivan Zhakov of VisualSVN discovered a remotely triggerable denial
    of service vulnerability in the mod_authz_svn module during COPY or
    MOVE authorization check. An authenticated remote attacker could
    take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service
    (Subversion server crash) via COPY or MOVE requests with specially
    crafted header.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.10-6+deb8u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.
