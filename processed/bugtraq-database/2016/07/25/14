                 CVE-2016-5739

Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in phpMyAdmin, the web-based
MySQL administration interface.

CVE-2016-1927

    The suggestPassword function relied on a non-secure random number
    generator which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess
    generated passwords via a brute-force approach.

CVE-2016-2039

    CSRF token values were generated by a non-secure random number
    genrator, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
    restrictions by predicting a value.

CVE-2016-2040

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-2041

    phpMyAdmin does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing
    CSRF tokens, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass
    intended access restrictions by measuring time differences.

CVE-2016-2560

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-2561

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5099

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5701

    For installations running on plain HTTP, phpMyAdmin allows remote
    attackers to conduct BBCode injection attacks against HTTP sessions
    via a crafted URI.

CVE-2016-5705

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5706

    phpMyAdmin allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (resource consumption) via a large array in the scripts parameter.

CVE-2016-5731

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5733

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

CVE-2016-5739

    A specially crafted Transformation could leak information which
    a remote attacker could use to perform cross site request forgeries.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.2.12-2+deb8u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.6.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.
