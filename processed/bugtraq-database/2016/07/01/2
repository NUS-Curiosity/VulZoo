Subject: [CVE-2016-5728] Double-Fetch Vulnerability in Linux-4.5/drivers/misc/mic/host/mic_virtio.c

I found this double-fetch vulnerability when I was doing my research on double-fetch issue analysis, and Iï¿½d like to make an anouncement here. 

This was found in Linux kernel file Linux-4.5/drivers/misc/mic/host/mic_virtio.c, and crafted user space data change under race condition will lead to consequences like over-boundary access on the kernel buffer, information leakage or kernel crash.
