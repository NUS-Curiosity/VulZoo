8) About Flexera

Flexera  helps  application  producers  and  enterprises  increase
application usage and the value they derive from their software.

http://www.flexera.com

Flexera delivers market-leading Software Vulnerability Management
solutions  enabling  enterprises  to  proactively  identify  and
remediate software vulnerabilities, effectively reducing the risk of
costly security breaches.

https://www.flexera.com/products/software-vulnerability-management

Flexera  supports  and  contributes  to the  community in  several
ways.  We  have  always  believed  that  reliable  vulnerability
intelligence and tools to aid identifying and fixing vulnerabilities
should be freely available for consumers to ensure that users,
who care about their online privacy and security, can stay secure.
Only a few vendors address vulnerabilities in a proper way and help
users get updated and stay secure. End-users (whether private
individuals or businesses) are otherwise left largely alone, and
that is why back in 2002, Secunia Research started investigating,
coordinating disclosure and verifying software vulnerabilities.
In 2016, Secunia Research became a part of Flexera and today
our in-house software vulnerability research remains the core of
the Software Vulnerability Management products at Flexera.

https://www.flexera.com/company/secunia-research/

The  public Secunia Advisory database  contains  information  for
researchers, security enthusiasts, and consumers to lookup individual
products and vulnerabilities and assess, whether they need to take
any actions to secure their systems or whether a given vulnerability
has already been discovered.
