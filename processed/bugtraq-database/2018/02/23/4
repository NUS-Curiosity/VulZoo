Apologies. This fails to account for a non-trivial scenario.

Any software using Doorkeeper that has generated its own custom
views[0] requires manual work to verify there's no explicit HTML in
the `client_name` and `native_redirect_uri` field values.

This has been updated in the bulletin's Fix section[1].
