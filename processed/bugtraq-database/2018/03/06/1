Package        : trafficserver
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-5660 CVE-2017-7671

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Apache Traffic Server, a
reverse and forward proxy server. They could lead to the use of an
incorrect upstream proxy, or allow a remote attacker to cause a
denial-of-service by application crash.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.0-6+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your trafficserver packages.

For the detailed security status of trafficserver please refer to
its security tracker page at:
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/trafficserver
