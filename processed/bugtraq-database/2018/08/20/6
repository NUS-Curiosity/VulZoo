Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-3620 CVE-2018-3646

Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in the way the
Intel processor designs have implemented speculative execution of
instructions in combination with handling of page-faults. This flaw
could allow an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read
memory from arbitrary (non-user controlled) addresses, including from
the kernel and all other processes running on the system or cross
guest/host boundaries to read host memory.

To fully resolve these vulnerabilities it is also necessary to install
updated CPU microcode (only available in Debian non-free). Common server
class CPUs are covered in the update released as DSA 4273-1.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.110-3+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
