Package        : smarty3
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-1000480
Debian Bug     : 886460

CÃ´me Chilliet from the FusionDirectory team detected a regression in the
previously issued fix for CVE-2017-1000480. This regression only affects
the Jessie version of the patch. For reference, the relevant part of the
original advisory text follows.

It was discovered that Smarty, a PHP template engine, was vulnerable to
code-injection attacks. An attacker was able to craft a filename in
comments that could lead to arbitrary code execution on the host running
Smarty.

For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.21-1+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your smarty3 packages.
