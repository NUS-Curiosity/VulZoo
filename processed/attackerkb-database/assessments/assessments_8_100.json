Attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability can gain remote code execution as the `root` user, meaning that this a perfect vulnerability for attackers looking to gain an initial foothold into a network.\r\n\r\nAdditionally as these are security cameras, I imagine there are a lot of nasty things one could potentially do with these devices related to spying on companies and operations that could pave the way to more crimes down the line. So the effects of this attack on an enterprise could potentially go beyond just a network breach.\r\n\r\nFortunately this is an authenticated attack and it requires valid login credentials to exploit. Unfortunately though, these are the types of devices that people tend to set up and then forget about until its needed, so I wouldn't be surprised if people were still running these cameras with the default credentials of `root` and `admin`.",

      "document": "This was an authentication bypass in NETGEAR R6700 versions V1.0.2.8 and prior that was exploited by Pedro Ribeiro and Radek Domanski of Team Flashback in 2019's Pwn2Own Tokyo competition. It occurs when network adjacent computers send SOAPAction UPnP messages to a vulnerable Netgear R6700v3 router, which does not appropriately validate that the user is logged in prior to performing the requested actions.\r\n\r\nWhilst this vulnerability in and of itself doesn't allow for remote code execution, its important to note that it is an authentication bypass that allows one to access the router as the Administrator user. Usually after you get this level of access, its considerably easier to start cracking open the security of the device as now its assumed your the Administrator and want to make these changes willingly, so the device generally will not attempt to check as many of your requests before performing your desired action, which can lead to additional security bugs that grant you code execution on the device.\r\n\r\nIn this case this is exactly what happened and CVE-2020-10924 can be used in combination with this bug to gain RCE on any vulnerable NEATGEAR R6700 router running firmware version V1.0.2.8 or prior to gain full control over the target device. It is therefore strongly recommended to patch this vulnerability alongside CVE-2020-10924 on any affected devices.",

Note that whilst this vulnerability does require authentication to exploit, attackers can easily bypass this requirement via CVE-2020-10923, as was done in the Pwn2Own competition.\r\n\r\nSuccessful exploitation grants the attacker the ability to change memory and settings on the target device, which was used in the Pwn2Own competition, and in the Metasploit module that was subsequently created, to reset the admin password back to its factory default of `password`, thereby allowing attackers to enable Telnet on the target device and gain a shell as the `root` user.\r\n\r\nAs a Metasploit module for this vulnerability exists which reliably results in RCE as `root`, it is strongly recommended  to apply patches for this vulnerability. Do however keep in mind that as this vulnerability relies on UPNP, it is likely that an attacker would still need to be within your local network in order to exploit this vulnerability, though if they do exploit it they will gain full control over the router itself, which could end up allowing them to either gain an initial foothold into your network, or potentially hop between networks.",

      "document": "A command injection vulnerability in the `network` POST parameter of the  `/maint/modules/endpointcfg/endpoint_devicemap.php` page on Fonality Trixbox Community Edition versions 1.2.0 through 2.8.0.4 allowed remote authenticated attackers to take complete control over the affected devices as the `asterisk` user, and then elevate to `root` by running `sudo nmap --interactive` followed by `!sh` from within `nmap`.\r\n\r\nMy personal opinion on this is that it is a very wide ranging vulnerability in terms of the number of versions affected. We are talking over 60% of the released versions of Fonality Trixbox Community Edition were affected by this vulnerability, although the main downside is that Fonality TrixBox Community Edition is no longer supported by its developers.\r\n\r\nThis creates an interesting question cause whilst telephony systems are known to run out of date and depreciated software (as is the case with many public service departments), I don't know if this particular software would still be used in most departments or if they would have just moved on by this point. Particularly given that this software is the community edition I imagine most users would have moved on to other software by now, but we all know that, like Windows XP, some people will still cling to what they know is tried and true. That being said I would have to imagine that the numbers have diminished significantly in the time between the last release of Fonality TrixBox Community Edition and now.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the requirement for a user to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability means that simply setting a strong password on affected devices will likely prevent them from being compromised by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTLDR: An interesting vulnerability but seeing as the software is no longer supported and it does require authenticated access, its probably not something that should be at the top of your priority list unless you know you are running TrixBox Community Edition, in which case if you can't upgrade it is recommended you ensure all devices have a strong password, as this will prevent users from easily being able to exploit this vulnerability.",

      "document": "I've seen some news headlines with very scary-sounding words (\"ransacking networks!\") on this, which is dismaying. It's completely understandable that folks would be alarmed by a zero-day (now patched), but when we get into the details of this one a bit, I would tend to doubt that it's going to be a good candidate for mass exploitation (note that I'm not telling anyone not to patch, just that headlines aren't always reality!).\r\n\r\nEven before getting into the weeds a little more, we can see from the [CVSSv3 metrics](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4006) that this **requires high-privileged access** and carries a 7.2 severity rating. I've watched researchers prove severity ratings wrong in the past, to be sure, but [looking at the advisory](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html), we can see that any attempt at exploitation would require an attacker to have access to the admin configurator on port 8443, plus admin credentials for the configurator account. If you have that level of access as an attacker, you can do all sorts of nefarious things with it, but those requirements don't lend themselves to easy exploitation. It's a good one to patch, but it also sounds like this is another case where strong password policies (especially for admin accounts!) would go a long way toward mitigating the risk of vulns both known and unknown. Ensuring that management interfaces are not exposed to the internet is another good move!\r\n\r\nThe NSA reported this vulnerability to VMware directly as a zero-day, which likely means they were seeing a specific threat actor deploy it in targeted intelligence operations. We haven't seen any other reports of exploitation yet. From reading [the docs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workspace-ONE-Access/20.10/workspace_one_access_install/GUID-6EF14E22-3B13-4163-9B3E-25E19A2E192B.html), it looks like admins are required to change the password upon configuration, so the tried and true combo of `admin:admin` shouldn't be possible.",

      "document": "A nice little LPE technique which takes advantage of several issues as originally noted by James Forshaw at https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2082. In particular, by running a program that communicates with the kernel via the `CfCreatePlaceholders` API, an attacker can exploit an issue within the cloud filter driver `cldflt.sys`, which runs in kernel mode, whereby placeholder files are not handled appropriately.\r\n\r\nAs James mentions within his writeup, several issues occur within `cldflt.sys` when creating placeholder files, which are described below:\r\n\r\n1. The FSCTL control code which is sent to the kernel mode filter driver to instruct it to create the placeholder file will result in the filter driver calling `FltCreateFileEx()` without specifying the `IO_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK` or `OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK` flags to force access checks to occur. As calling `FltCreateFileEx()` effectively calls `IoCreateFileEx()` with the `IO_NO_PARAMETER_CHECKING` flag set. \r\n\r\nFor more details on these parameters see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-iocreatefile which notes that if `IO_NO_PARAMETER_CHECKING` is used, the parameters are not probed to see if they reside in user mode memory or cause access violations. Looking at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntdef/ns-ntdef-_object_attributes also shows that the `OBJ_FORCE_ACCESS_CHECK` flag will enforce the permission checking of an object prior to using it even if the handle is being opened in kernel mode.\r\n\r\nSo effectively what is happening is that cause these flags are not being specified, the kernel is implicitly trusting the user's input and failing to perform appropriate access checks prior to performing the file operation in kernel mode on the user's behalf.\r\n\r\n2. The cloud driver takes in a path which is split up into a base sync path, which is checked for write access, and a filename component, which isn't checked for path separators. So you can specify one base sync path but multiple path separators in the filename component and essentially trick Windows into thinking that you are writing to one directory that you have write access to, whereas in reality you are writing to a subdirectory of that directory that you might not normally have write access to (again remember that the access checks will be bypassed due to the write operation occurring with KeMode privileges).\r\n\r\n3. Whilst the call to `FltCreateFileEx()` uses the `FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT` to block directly accessing a reparse point, that only prevents it from attempting to access a mount point directly. If you instead create a subdirectory within the mount point and point it at that instead, it will still access the mount point, allowing you to write the file anywhere you would like.\r\n\r\nCombining this all together one can create an exploit that either a) Uses an existing directory that we have write permissions to, and then using the permission check error and the directory path error, we can write a file to one of the subdirectories we wouldn't normally have access to, or one can use the reparse point bug instead to write a file to anywhere on the system.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft patched this bug in December 2020 by changing the `HsmpOpCreatePlaceholders()` function in `cldflt.sys` to add additional checks. I have only done a preliminary inspection of this function but it appears that there are some new checks for the path, specifically r.e the use of `\\` characters, and a few jumps were changed in their logic. Unfortunately as the function is rather large at 190 blocks and I don't have the time to dive into this in depth right now this is as much as I was able to confirm. I also found that if you run the exploit on a patched system you will now get the error message: `System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException (0x8007017C): The cloud operation is invalid. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007017C)`, which was not returned previously when attempting to run the PoC from James Forshaw.",

More info [here](https://github.com/oskarsve/ms-teams-rce)\r\n\r\nIt also should be noted that the RCE gets triggered by the XSS injection that has to be sent through teams.microsoft.com - it is possible, though untested, that Microsoft has already patched this server side - not allowing the known XSS trigger to be pasted through to affected clients\r\n\r\nIt's recommended you double check Microsoft Teams is up to date and auto updates are working as expected.

The 'rsearch' calculation for the 'post' size resulted in a size that was too large, and could underflow to max uint32_t.\r\n\r\nGhostScript is a pretty popular engine for Postscript and PDF documents. A critical feature of this is the sandbox which makes it safe to view documents received from untrusted sources. Escaping from the sandbox would all a malicious user to leverage dangerous functions that are builtin that can allow arbitrary file reading and writing along with OS command execution in certain environments.\r\n\r\nThe sandbox escape can be performed by leveraging the underflow to access memory outside the permissible boundary. By reading key locations, a specially crafted malicious document could corrupt the flag that controls the sandbox.\r\n\r\nA weaponized version of this exploit would likely need to tell if it's on Windows or LInux, which may be able to be determined at runtime by performing a file read and handling failures using well known file paths as the target.\r\n\r\nSee: https://insomniasec.com/blog/ghostscript-cve-2020-15900",

That said, the attack vector seems to be [Local](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.0/specification-document#2-1-1-Attack-Vector-AV) but can be exploited remotely, which means that some kind of malicious file needs to be placed locally to be scanned by Windows Defender and trigger the vulnerability. After talking about this with @smcintyre-r7 and @bwatters-r7, we can imagine that `Remote` means this file needs to be sent remotely somehow, for example, using a file upload in a website or an email attachment via Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome considerations to keep in mind: Windows defender vulnerabilities get patched immediately and automatically, without user interactions. So, the exploitation window is very short. Finally, even if the exploitation succeeds, the evasion will be problematic, since the anti-virus will probably detect the attack.",

      "document": "There appears to be a lot of hype at the moment surrounding this vulnerability given the recent Tweets from @jonaslyk on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jonasLyk/status/1347900440000811010 as well as the follow up article from BleepingComputer at https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-bug-corrupts-your-hard-drive-on-seeing-this-files-icon/.\r\n\r\nWhilst this bug is made out to sound like a catastrophic disaster in Windows that could result in data loss should a user browse to a malicious file path containing the string `C:/:$i30:` followed by a file name such as `C:/:$i30:$bitmap`, the reality is that, at least in my tests, this is not the case. In fact during my tests I found the following:\r\n\r\n1. The disk is not actually corrupted. If you try to access files on the disk, you can still interact with them and do things normally without any issues. Windows just somehow thinks that the disk is corrupted, even though it isn't.\r\n2. Rebooting will case Windows to check the disk and try to repair it. If you skip this disk check, Windows will still think that the disk is corrupted, even though your computer will work fine. You will have to run a disk check by going to File Explorer, right clicking on the affected drive such as `C:\\`, clicking `Properties`, then the `Tools` tab, and click `Check` under the `Error Checking` section. This will then require the computer to reboot, which should be pretty quick (a few seconds in my case for a clean Windows 10 20H2 VM), after which Windows will have self corrected itself and will no longer assume the disk is corrupt.\r\n3. You can trigger this remotely via handlers such as the `file://` handler so this could be exploited remotely by embedding a HTML link into a web page that invokes the `file://` handler on `C:/:$i30:$bitmap`. This will cause an immediate warning to display on the user's computer that the drive is corrupted, which may be enough to convince them to reboot. Alternatively the user could just continue to use the computer and ignore the warning with no side effects.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion this seems more like a logic/state error bug where Windows is tricked into thinking a drive is corrupted when it is not than any real serious issue, at least from the results that I am seeing in a VM. I don't know if physical computers would be any different as I haven't tested it on a physical machine, but I do not believe there would be any reason to believe the results would be different.",
