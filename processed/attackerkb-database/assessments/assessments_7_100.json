Let's break this down lightly.\r\n\r\nThis particular CVE can be compared to [CVE-2019-11539](https://attackerkb.com/topics/9xmWr9M5KE/cve-2019-11539), which is also an authenticated RCE that requires access to the admin interface. So, the fact that this requires admin interface access ([SSRF](https://blog.orange.tw/2019/09/attacking-ssl-vpn-part-3-golden-pulse-secure-rce-chain.html) notwithstanding) significantly reduces the impact of the vuln.\r\n\r\nBut wait, there's more! Why was CVE-2019-11539 such a big deal, then? We have to consider the effects of [CVE-2019-11510](https://attackerkb.com/topics/lx3Afd7fbJ/cve-2019-11510) in the exploit chain. We were able to leak session cookies with CVE-2019-11510, among many other things, which let us authenticate our post-auth RCE. All it takes is one info leak primitive. And short of an info leak, creds can still be compromised in other ways, such as through default creds, password spraying, or even a file in an SMB share somewhere (hopefully internal).\r\n\r\nSo, uh, yeah. Patch this. Secure your creds and don't make them `admin:admin`. Admin access alone is devastating. Don't add root RCE to it. VPN is the window into your org.",

      "document": "The Zerologon vulnerability is related to the misuse of the AES-CFB8 cipher within the MS-NRPC (Netlogon) service. The result is that 1 in 256 authentication attempts using an all-zero plaintext value will result in an all-zero ciphertext. This means that a user can authenticate as a target system without knowledge of the shared secret which is the hash of the client's computer account password.\r\n\r\nThe affected service by default uses a very high (around 40,000-50,000) TCP port. This port is dynamic since it is a DCERPC service. An attacker must know this value in order to connect to and communicate with the Netlogon service. To find it, an attacker can use the mapping service on tcp/135 to query the services by GUID (`12345678-1234-abcd-ef00-01234567cffb`). While it is possible to leverage the vulnerability using a named pipe interface  over SMB (tcp/445), it requires authentication which sort of defeats the purpose of the vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMost public PoCs (including the Metasploit Framework module) leverage the vulnerability to authenticate to the Netlogon service and then changes the machine account password to an empty / blank value. This value has the LM/NTLM hash value of `aad3b435b51404eeaad3b435b51404ee:31d6cfe0d16ae931b73c59d7e0c089c0`. This technique relies on using the [`NetrServerPasswordSet2`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-nrpc/14b020a8-0bcf-4af5-ab72-cc92bc6b1d81) function which encrypts the new computer account password with the session key that also misuses the AES-CFB8 cipher. After exploitation the attacker can use this hash value to authenticate to the target Domain Controller using the machine account (the NetBIOS name with a `$` suffix, e.g. `WIN2019$`). After leveraging this vulnerability to reset the machine account password, it's important that the attacker restore the original value to prevent authentication failures to the target Domain Controller.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability does not appear to affect Windows Server 2008 which was not patched by Microsoft.",

      "document": "Over the past couple of years (2018-2020) attacks against RDP have become more and more common. Recent improvements in attacker-related tooling can be contributed to generally available and mature projects targeting RDP and a number of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities being disclosed.\r\n\r\n# Memory Corruption Flaws\r\nOne of the best examples of this is [CVE-2019-0708](https://attackerkb.com/topics/huQasjoVMS/windows-remote-desktop-rdp-use-after-free-vulnerablility-bluekeep) (AKA BlueKeep) which was an unauthenticated, remotely exploitable use-after-free in RDP. This particular vulnerability was able to be developed to yield semi-reliable code execution and is widely utilized by attackers. Following this, [CVE-2019-1182](https://attackerkb.com/topics/71QrpupdZO/dejablue-rdp-heap-overflow) (AKA DejaBlue) was discovered as well. This particular bug was a heap corruption within the server's dynamic channel handling. While this vulnerability has not to this date had exploitat code released, it also contributed to the popularity of RDP vulnerability research in 2019. \r\n\r\n# Why RDP As An Attack Surface?\r\nRegardless of code execution-type vulnerabilities, RDP is an attractive attack surface for the following reasons:\r\n* It's commonly accessible internally and relatively accessible externally\r\n* It's common that non-administrative users can authenticate to it, offering an initial foothold to attackers\r\n* The service can yield version information about the host operating system\r\n* Established sessions can be hijacked using publicly documented tools techniques and procedure (TTPs)\r\n* In addition to offering a graphical interface to the desktop session, it can also be used to mount drives and transfer files\r\n\r\nWhen compared to an interface such as SMB for the purpose of lateral movement, RDP offers a much larger degree of freedom for the attacker. Using SMB, attackers are able to use a small number of techniques to achieve code execution such as PSexec. Alternatively, RDP through it's graphical interface and file transfer capabilities offers attackers near limitless possibilities. This number of possibilities directly improves the attackers evasion capabilities as they can easily adapt and shift techniques that are blocked through whatever sort of endpoint protection maybe present. Furthermore, SMB as an attack surface is very well know and widely documented. For those reasons, and the fact that there are choke points from an attacker workflow perspective, there are mature defenses and controls in place (such as event monitoring) that are either not applicable to or are less effective when compared to RDP.",

      "document": "From my reading of https://h0mbre.github.io/atillk64_exploit, this reminds me a bit of heartbleed, though in addition to a read tool, this also allows for writing. .  The atillk64.sys driver is vulnerable to abuse of a function that maps physical memory into a process's virtual memory space.  The relative gist of the vulnerability is that you can trick the driver into mapping kernel memory into your unprivileged process's space to read or write.  It reminds me of heartbleed because there's some guesswork involved, and there is some searching required as an attacker will not know exactly what memory they want to map.\r\nMapping kernel memory into a arbitrary, unprivileged process is bad because fundamentally, all memory is kernel memory, and being able to change kernel memory allows someone to alter the function of the operating system.\r\nIn the case of the above blog, the author maps the kernel's metadata for processes (the EPROCESS kernel structure) into a user-level process they control.  In doing so, it allows them to copy the permission token from a high privileged process into their own low-privileged process, affecting a privilege escalation.\r\nThat's not the limit to this particular exploit.  There are a lot of valuable things that could be accessed and this could be easily converted to a code execution vulnerability by overwriting a memory block with executable code and then adjusting a driver dispatch table.  Such an action would allow an attacker to patch in their own dispatch handlers.  The authors did not do that because token stealing is simpler, easier, and there are far fewer protections against it than patching in code, but as a thought exercise, it is possible with this vulnerability.\r\nMitigations include updating the driver or removing it from your system.  The vulnerable version is 5.11.9.0, so defenders can check to see if it is present on systems.\r\n",

      "document": "### Overview\r\n\r\nCrafting IPv6 ICMP Router Advertisement Packets can lead to DOS or **potential** RCE on vulnerable devices. It is going to be difficult to develop a Full RCE with this exploit. You should of course patch quickly, however you do not need to \"panic\" when applying patches and mitigations for this across your estate. \r\n\r\nThe range of Windows Operating Systems impacted by this exploit is smaller than expected as this is a relatively new feature in the code. Server 2019 is not widely used on the open internet so is unlikely to garner much attention and Automatic Security Updates to windows 10 devices should mean that organisations are less vulnerable to this becomes a widespread effective exploit. \r\n\r\n### Mitigation\r\n\r\nPatching is of course the best mitigation. \r\n\r\nDisable IPv6 is a mitigation I have seen talked about this is a bad idea if you don't understand what on your system may already be using it. Instead, disable the specific feature `netsh int ipv6 set int *INTERFACENUMBER* rabaseddnsconfig=disable`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Detection\r\n\r\nSuricata - https://github.com/advanced-threat-research/CVE-2020-16898\r\nSnort - https://www.snort.org/rule_docs/1-55984\r\nZeek - https://github.com/corelight/CVE-2020-16898\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Advisory - https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-16898\r\n\r\nMcAfee have a great writeup that details the vulnerability so I'm not going to repeat that read it from the source :) \r\nhttps://www.mcafee.com/blogs/other-blogs/mcafee-labs/cve-2020-16898-bad-neighbor/\r\n\r\nQuarksLab have also released a detailed blog post explaining how they were able to create a PoC - https://blog.quarkslab.com/beware-the-bad-neighbor-analysis-and-poc-of-the-windows-ipv6-router-advertisement-vulnerability-cve-2020-16898.html\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nThere are two elements to this vulnerability:\r\n\r\n##### DOS\r\n\r\nIt is trivial to trigger a crash condition that will lead to BSOD and force a restart of the OS. The POC contains python scapy code that can be used to crash a vulnerable target\r\n\r\n##### RCE\r\n\r\nWhilst RCE is technically possible gaining it from this exploit alone is extremely difficult due to the nature of the vuln and the protections in place on modern Windows. \r\n\r\nPaired with another vulnerability that can leak additional information in memory it is possible this **could** lead to RCE and from there to a wormable exploit. \r\n\r\n### Proof Of Concept\r\n\r\nThe QuarksLab research includes a Python PoC that is successful at triggering a Crash.

The writeup by Kaspersky Labs can be found at https://securelist.com/windows-0-day-exploit-cve-2019-1458-used-in-operation-wizardopium/95432/ which shows that this vulnerability was used in conjunction with CVE-2019-13720, which was a 0day in the Chrome browser at the time that occurred due to a race condition between two threads.\r\n\r\n In the WizardOpium attacks, the Chrome vulnerability, aka CVE-2019-13720, was first used to gain an arbitrary read/write primitive in the Chrome render process that lead to arbitrary code execution as the Chrome render (read more on this at https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=888923 if your interested). However this still left attackers with a problem: they needed some way to escape the Chrome render's sandbox if they wanted to get persistent access to the target.\r\n\r\nThis is where CVE-2019-1458 came in. Looking at the advisory at https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1458 we can see this vulnerability affected quite a wide range of targets, going all the way from Windows 7 up to Windows 10 v1607. Later versions of Windows 10 are not affected, however. \r\n\r\nIf one dives around the internet a little bit more though they will stumble across https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/rca-cve-2019-1458.html which was written by the Project Zero team at Google which explains the vulnerability quite well. In essence there is a Uninitialized Variable error in Windows within its Windows Switching code whereby the field `*(gpsi + 0x154)` in the global structure `tagSERVERINFO`, which describes system windows (such as menus, desktops, switch windows, etc), which was not properly initialized at the start of a function, which allowed user mode code to set extra window data in a task switch window of Window class `FNID_SWITCH`, or `0x280`, which can normally only be set by the kernel. Even worse though is the fact that this extra window data is essentially a pointer which is then dereferenced and then written to, which grants the attacker a limited arbitrary write primitive in kernel mode, which then can then use to perform limited controlled writes to kernel memory and take over the system. Attackers then used this limited kernel write primitive to overwrite their current process's access token value with the value of the SYSTEM process's access token value, thereby allowing them to execute code as SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nIf one then looks at https://github.com/piotrflorczyk/cve-2019-1458_POC, which does a deep technical dive into all of the details of this vulnerability, one can see that the affected function was `InitFunctionTables()` within `win32k.sys`, which didn't appropriately initialize the fields `*(gpsi+0x14E)`, `*(gpsi+0x154)`, and  `*(gpsi+0x180)`, despite initializing other fields within the same structure. Microsoft's patch ensured that these fields were all set up and initialized with appropriate values at the start of the `InitFunctionTables()` call, thus preventing this issue from occurring.",

      "document": "This is one of a set of vulnerabilities from the Zero Day Initiative affecting VMWare products.  This is the most significant and most valuable to attackers in my opinion as this affects ESXi servers which are difficult and sometimes impossible to patch, depending on the age and type of hardware.  VMWare ESXi updates can be done through a VMWare vCenter server, but as those are not present in all environments, a complex, manual update may be necessary, assuming the update is compatible with the hardware.  The lack of legacy support and possible manual nature of VMWare ESXi's update process will likely increase the time-availability of this vulnerability for attackers, even in enterprise environments.\r\nThe exploit target is the OpenSLP service on port 427, open and running in a default configuration.  Here is a UDP nmap scan of an affected server:\r\n```\r\nStarting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-10-20 13:05 CDT\r\nNmap scan report for server.redacted (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)\r\nHost is up (0.00055s latency).\r\nNot shown: 998 open|filtered ports\r\nPORT    STATE  SERVICE\r\n161/udp closed snmp\r\n427/udp open   svrloc\r\n\r\nNmap done: 2 IP addresses (1 host up) scanned in 10.32 seconds\r\n```\r\nThe service is vulnerable to a specially crafted packet that can cause a use-after-free allowing arbitrary code execution.  It is important to note that in the VMWare advisory here (https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0023.html), they include impacted products other than ESXi, but those are for other vulnerabilities that are less severe.  A good breakdown of the vulnerabilities is here: https://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/SB2020102044\r\n\r\nI have not yet seen a PoC for this vulnerability, so it is difficult to comment on the exact difficulty for the exploit, but given the nature of ESXi servers as often critical infrastructure with access to login servers like Domain Controllers, their high uptime requirements, specialty operating system, and difficulty patching, even if the exploit were highly complex, it would still be worth it for a given attacker.",

      "document": "Pulse Secure's 2019 vulns are garnering another wave of attention this week as a result of the NSA's newly published [list of CVEs exploited by Chinese state actors](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/20/2002519884/-1/-1/0/CSA_CHINESE_EXPLOIT_VULNERABILITIES_UOO179811.PDF). Out of the batch of 2019 disclosures from Orange Tsai's and Meh Chang's research, CVE-2019-11510, an pre-authenticated arbitrary file read, was the highest priority for attackers and defenders. The pre-auth file read was a necessary primitive for CVE-2019-11539,  a post-authentication vuln that enables attackers to execute commands as root on vulnerable Pulse Secure VPN servers. \r\n\r\nExploit chain: CVE-2020-11510 provides necessary info (plaintext/hashed creds, session IDs) that enables a remote attacker to leverage CVE-2020-11539 to execute commands with the highest privilege level. There's a [Metasploit exploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/12515) out that automates the exploit chain, but note that a valid admin session is needed. The original blog from the researchers who disclosed the vulns does a great job of explaining in-depth technical details, too\u2014do [check it out](https://devco.re/blog/2019/09/02/attacking-ssl-vpn-part-3-the-golden-Pulse-Secure-ssl-vpn-rce-chain-with-Twitter-as-case-study/) if you haven't done so! \r\n\r\nPulse Secure patched these vulnerabilities in April, 2019. Technical details, public research, and exploits were released over the next six months. There's been plenty of information available to attackers for quite some time now\u2014I hope organizations have patched given the severity of the bugs and the critical position of SSL VPNs.",

      "document": "Analysis performed using tcpip.sys from Windows 10 v1909 x64 (sha256: f2a0cb717ccbe7e7ff93ccadaeb23df4a8a76b386b6623fee1b5a975c3f16bfa)\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nA crafted IPv6 Router Advertisement frame can a stack based buffer overflow due to an improper calculation of the RDNSS\r\n(type 25) option. When an RDNSS option uses a crafted length with an even value the parser will interpret the last 8\r\nbytes of it as the start of the next option. When combined with fragmentation, this can cause a overflow due to the size\r\nof the mis-interpreted header not being validated.\r\n\r\n### Exploitability Analysis\r\nThe public PoCs reliably reproduce this vulnerability to trigger a bug check condition. The relevant function is\r\n`tcpip!Ipv6pHandleRouterAdvertisement` which handles the parsing logic and is the function whose local variable is\r\noverflown. The public PoCs use a Route Information (type 24) option to actually perform the overflow. In this case the\r\nactual overflow is performed by a call to [`NdisGetDataBuffer`][1] at `Ipv6pHandleRouterAdvertisement+0xb8a01`.\r\n\r\nIn this call, the third parameter `Storage` is a pointer to the stack at location `rbp+0xb8`. From the documentation:\r\n\r\n> (Storage is) a pointer to a buffer, or NULL if no buffer is provided by the caller. The buffer must be greater than or\r\n> equal in size to the number of bytes specified in BytesNeeded . If this value is non-NULL, and the data requested is\r\n> not contiguous, NDIS copies the requested data to the area indicated by Storage.\r\n\r\nSince `Storage` is non-NULL, non-contiguous (due to the packet fragmentation), it is used as a destination buffer and\r\n`wOptLength` bytes are copied to it. In this context, `wOptLength` is the length of the option in the original data\r\ntimes 8. With a length of 176 (field value 0x16), the stack cookie at offset `rbp+0x260` will be overwritten. As the\r\nfunction returns, this leads to a Bug Check when the stack cookie is checked at\r\n`tcpip!Ipv6pHandleRouterAdvertisement+0x10e0`. The value of the stack cookie is also XORed with the value of the stack\r\npointer (`rsp`) so knowing the value would not be sufficient to replace it in the overwrite.\r\n\r\nAfter the overflow operation has taken place, the loop continues to process the following options:\r\n\r\n* Type 3 (Prefix Information)\r\n* Type 24 (Route Information)\r\n* Type 25 (RDNSS)\r\n* Type 31 (DNS Search List Option)\r\n\r\n(see: http://blog.pi3.com.pl/?p=780)\r\n\r\nFrom the [/GS (Buffer Security Check)][2] documentation:\r\n\r\n> A vulnerable parameter is allocated before the cookie and local variables. A buffer overrun can overwrite these\r\n> parameters. And code in the function that uses these parameters could cause an attack before the function returns and\r\n> the security check is performed.  \r\n\r\nAfter inspecting the logic for each of the four types that will be processed, there were no identified references to\r\nvalues which could be controlled by an attacker using the overflow. While the handler for the Prefix Information (type\r\n3) option uses a 32 byte buffer which could be controlled by the attacker starting at `rbp+0x200`, it is `memset` to\r\nzero at `Ipv6pHandleRouterAdvertisement+0xa19`.\r\n\r\nThere are no other references to the space between `rbp+0x1b8` (`&Storage`) and `rbp+0x260` (the stack cookie) that are\r\naccessible from this late in the Ipv6pHandleRouterAdvertisement function.\r\n\r\nAn alternative vector could potentially utilize a Search List (type 31) option to trigger the overflow. This function\r\nmakes a similar call to `NdisGetDataBuffer` with a location on the stack. In this case the attacker can overflow the\r\nbuffer starting at `rbp+0x90` and overwrite the stack cookie at `rbp+0x190`. This function is less interesting as there\r\nappear to be no usable references before the return and there is no looping logic due to the handler and overflow being\r\na subroutine of `Ipv6pHandleRouterAdvertisement`.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ndis/nf-ndis-ndisgetdatabuffer\r\n[2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/gs-buffer-security-check?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=vs-2019\r\n",

      "document": "# Overview\r\nThe PyYAML library contains a vulnerability where an attacker with control over data which is loaded using the `load` function can trigger arbitrary Python code execution. The latest version as of this writing ([5.3.1](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/5.3.1/)) is affected. PyYAML version 4.1 changed the default load to use `safe_load` by default, however this was reverted in the [4.2 release](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/193). Later, in version 5.1 the PyYAML project implemented a new default `FullLoader` class which prevented function calls but is in sufficient to prevent code execution.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nThe latest versions of PyYAML (5.1+) use a default loader implementation that allow deserialization of objects and references but not functions. The builtin `map` is a class in Python3 and can be used to apply the builtin `eval` function to indirectly trigger a function call.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n!!python/object/new:tuple \r\n- !!python/object/new:map \r\n  - !!python/name:eval\r\n  - [ \"RCE_HERE\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn attacker looking to leverage this vulnerability would need to identify that YAML is loaded by the application and then submit their crafted data to be loaded.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThe PyYAML library contains a two primary alternatives to load data safely. The first is to use the `load_safe` alternative, the second is to specify the `SafeLoader` class as the `Loader` keyword argument to the standard `load` function. This is detailed in the [PyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/wiki/PyYAML-yaml.load(input)-Deprecation) Wiki page. Developers using PyYAML should use one of these safe methods and ensure that they are not loading data from untrusted sources.\r\n\r\nSee: https://blog.arxenix.dev/pyyaml-cve/ for more information.",

      "document": "An error exists within `cng!CfgAdtpFormatPropertyBlock` where buffer is allocated from a value that is truncated to be 16-bits. The function then goes on and performs a binary to ASCII hex conversion, writing the ASCII hex characters to this buffer. While performing the conversion, the original buffer's correct length is used causing the write to continue out of bounds.\r\n\r\nThe vector for this vulnerability is local. A malicious attacker would first have to have code execution on the target system from any context including that of a sandboxed application. From there they would open a handle to `\\\\.\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\Cng` before issuing the 0x390400 IOCTL with a crafted input buffer. The crafted input buffer contains a size parameter as one of the fields that when set to 0x2aab or greater will trigger the overflow.\r\n\r\nExploitation of this bug won't be easy due to it being a heap based memory corruption within the kernel's NonPagedPool. The attacker has partial control over the size of the allocation as constrained by `((size * 6) & 0xffff)`.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was originally reported by Google's Project Zero who also reported that it is being actively exploited in the wild. The original report is on [their tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2104). The live in the wild exploitation is reportedly targeted and not related to the US elections. A patch is expected to be release on November 10th, 2020.\r\n\r\nWhile the vulnerable code appears to be present within Windows 7 SP1 x64 as verified through static analysis. The original PoC provided by Google's Project Zero team, does not trigger the bug on this platform. Within the callstack the chain is accessible, however a difference within the implementations is causing `cng!BCryptSetContextFunctionProperty` to branch leading to the path to `cng!CfgAdtReportFunctionPropertyModification` being missed.\r\n\r\n## Detection\r\nAttempted exploitation of this vulnerability can be detected through auditing event ID [5069](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-5069). This must be configured in order to detect exploitation attempts. To enable it, start `secpol.msc`, then navigate to `Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > System Audit Policies > Policy Change`. Set `Audit Other Policy Change Events` to enable both \"Success\" and \"Failure\". With this change in place, event ID 5069 will be loaded to the standard Windows Security Log that is accessible through the event viewer.\r\n\r\nExploitation attempts can then be identified through the length of the reported \"value\" field.\r\n\r\n![](https://zerosteiner.s3.amazonaws.com/images/cve-2020-17087-event.png)\r\n\r\n## Proof of Concept\r\nThe following is a port of the original Proof of Concept released by Google Project Zero into Python and updated to demonstrate the vulnerability on both Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 10.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport ctypes\r\nimport random\r\n\r\n# https://github.com/zeroSteiner/mayhem\r\nfrom mayhem.windll import *\r\n\r\nvalue = (ctypes.c_ubyte * 0x2aab)()\r\nbcrypt.BCryptSetContextFunctionProperty(\r\n    bcrypt.CRYPT_LOCAL,\r\n    'Default',\r\n    bcrypt.BCryptInterface.Cipher,\r\n    'AES',\r\n    \"XXX_{:08x}\".format(random.randint(0, 0xffffffff)),\r\n    len(value),\r\n    value\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of directly issuing the IOCTL, this variant uses the [`bcrypt!BCryptSetContextFunctionProperty`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/bcrypt/nf-bcrypt-bcryptsetcontextfunctionproperty) function with the appropriate arguments. Randomizing the `pszProperty` argument helps to ensure that the vulnerability is triggered exactly once each time the code is run.",

This attack got a lot of news attention at the time due to its sophistication and the fact that it was used with a Windows kernel privilege elevation (see https://attackerkb.com/topics/2i67dR7P4e/cve-2019-1458 for more details on the kernel exploit), something that tends to only occur in advanced attacks due to the development effort required. Therefore its not hard to find articles discussing it being used in the wild.",
