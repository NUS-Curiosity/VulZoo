Subject: KVM: Don't null dereference ops->destroy

commit e8bc2427018826e02add7b0ed0fc625a60390ae5 upstream.

A KVM device cleanup happens in either of two callbacks:
1) destroy() which is called when the VM is being destroyed;
2) release() which is called when a device fd is closed.

Most KVM devices use 1) but Book3s's interrupt controller KVM devices
(XICS, XIVE, XIVE-native) use 2) as they need to close and reopen during
the machine execution. The error handling in kvm_ioctl_create_device()
assumes destroy() is always defined which leads to NULL dereference as
discovered by Syzkaller.

This adds a checks for destroy!=NULL and adds a missing release().

This is not changing kvm_destroy_devices() as devices with defined
release() should have been removed from the KVM devices list by then.
