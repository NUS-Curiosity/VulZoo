Subject: crypto: qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of
 WORD_SZ

commit 16287397ec5c08aa58db6acf7dbc55470d78087d upstream.

The commit referenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break' from the else
branch in qcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop whenever 'max' is
not a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running:

    kcapi-rng -b 67 >/dev/null

There are many ways to fix this without adding back the 'break', but
they all seem more awkward than simply adding it back, so do just that.

Tested on a machine with Qualcomm Amberwing processor.
