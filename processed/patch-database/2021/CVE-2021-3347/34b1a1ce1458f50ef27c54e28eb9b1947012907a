Subject: futex: Handle faults correctly for PI futexes

fixup_pi_state_owner() tries to ensure that the state of the rtmutex,
pi_state and the user space value related to the PI futex are consistent
before returning to user space. In case that the user space value update
faults and the fault cannot be resolved by faulting the page in via
fault_in_user_writeable() the function returns with -EFAULT and leaves
the rtmutex and pi_state owner state inconsistent.

A subsequent futex_unlock_pi() operates on the inconsistent pi_state and
releases the rtmutex despite not owning it which can corrupt the RB tree of
the rtmutex and cause a subsequent kernel stack use after free.

It was suggested to loop forever in fixup_pi_state_owner() if the fault
cannot be resolved, but that results in runaway tasks which is especially
undesired when the problem happens due to a programming error and not due
to malice.

As the user space value cannot be fixed up, the proper solution is to make
the rtmutex and the pi_state consistent so both have the same owner. This
leaves the user space value out of sync. Any subsequent operation on the
futex will fail because the 10th rule of PI futexes (pi_state owner and
user space value are consistent) has been violated.

As a consequence this removes the inept attempts of 'fixing' the situation
in case that the current task owns the rtmutex when returning with an
unresolvable fault by unlocking the rtmutex which left pi_state::owner and
rtmutex::owner out of sync in a different and only slightly less dangerous
way.
