Subject: ACPI: fix NULL pointer dereference

Commit 71f642833284 ("ACPI: utils: Fix reference counting in
for_each_acpi_dev_match()") started doing "acpi_dev_put()" on a pointer
that was possibly NULL.  That fails miserably, because that helper
inline function is not set up to handle that case.

Just make acpi_dev_put() silently accept a NULL pointer, rather than
calling down to put_device() with an invalid offset off that NULL
pointer.
