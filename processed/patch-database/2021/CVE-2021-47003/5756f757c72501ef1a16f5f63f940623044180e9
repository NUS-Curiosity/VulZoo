Subject: dmaengine: idxd: Fix potential null dereference on pointer status

[ Upstream commit 28ac8e03c43dfc6a703aa420d18222540b801120 ]

There are calls to idxd_cmd_exec that pass a null status pointer however
a recent commit has added an assignment to *status that can end up
with a null pointer dereference.  The function expects a null status
pointer sometimes as there is a later assignment to *status where
status is first null checked.  Fix the issue by null checking status
before making the assignment.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Explicit null dereferenced")
Fixes: 89e3becd8f82 ("dmaengine: idxd: check device state before issue command")
