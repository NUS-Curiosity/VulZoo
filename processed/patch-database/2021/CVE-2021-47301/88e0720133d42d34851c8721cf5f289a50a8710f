Subject: igb: Fix use-after-free error during reset

[ Upstream commit 7b292608db23ccbbfbfa50cdb155d01725d7a52e ]

Cleans the next descriptor to watch (next_to_watch) when cleaning the
TX ring.

Failure to do so can cause invalid memory accesses. If igb_poll() runs
while the controller is reset this can lead to the driver try to free
a skb that was already freed.

(The crash is harder to reproduce with the igb driver, but the same
potential problem exists as the code is identical to igc)

Fixes: 7cc6fd4c60f2 ("igb: Don't bother clearing Tx buffer_info in igb_clean_tx_ring")
