Subject: atm: nicstar: Fix possible use-after-free in nicstar_cleanup()

[ Upstream commit 34e7434ba4e97f4b85c1423a59b2922ba7dff2ea ]

This module's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function
does not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the
timer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function
has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.

Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler
has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.
