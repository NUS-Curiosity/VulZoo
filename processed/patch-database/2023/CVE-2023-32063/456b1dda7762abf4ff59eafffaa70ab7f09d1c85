+Feature: Call view by direct link
+  In order to keep system ACL protected
+  As an Administrator
+  I should be sure that access to the calls by direct links are ACL protected
+
+  Scenario: Feature Background
+    Given sessions active:
+      | Admin  |first_session  |
+      | Admin1 |second_session |
+
+  Scenario: View call with default permissions
+    Given I proceed as the Admin
+    And I login as administrator
+    When I go to Activities/ Calls
+    Then I should see following grid:
+      | Subject   |
+      | Test Call |
+    When I click view "Test Call" in grid
+    And I should see "Test Call"
+
+  Scenario: Edit view permissions for Call entity
+    Given I proceed as the Admin1
+    And I login as administrator
+    And I go to System / User Management / Roles
+    And I filter Label as is equal to "Administrator"
+    When I click edit "Administrator" in grid
+    And select following permissions:
+      | Call | View:None |
+    And save and close form
+    Then I should see "Role saved" flash message
+
+  Scenario: View call by direct link without view permission
+    Given I proceed as the Admin
+    When I reload the page
+    Then I should see "403. Forbidden You don't have permission to access this page."
