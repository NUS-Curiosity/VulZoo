Subject: userfaultfd: shmem/hugetlbfs: only allow to register VM_MAYWRITE vmas

After the VMA to register the uffd onto is found, check that it has
VM_MAYWRITE set before allowing registration.  This way we inherit all
common code checks before allowing to fill file holes in shmem and
hugetlbfs with UFFDIO_COPY.

The userfaultfd memory model is not applicable for readonly files unless
it's a MAP_PRIVATE.
