Subject: cdrom: fix improper type cast, which can leat to information leak.

There is another cast from unsigned long to int which causes
a bounds check to fail with specially crafted input. The value is
then used as an index in the slot array in cdrom_slot_status().

This issue is similar to CVE-2018-16658 and CVE-2018-10940.
