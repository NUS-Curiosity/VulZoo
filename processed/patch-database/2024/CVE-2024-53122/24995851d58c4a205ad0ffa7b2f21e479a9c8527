Subject: mptcp: cope racing subflow creation in mptcp_rcv_space_adjust

commit ce7356ae35943cc6494cc692e62d51a734062b7d upstream.

Additional active subflows - i.e. created by the in kernel path
manager - are included into the subflow list before starting the
3whs.

A racing recvmsg() spooling data received on an already established
subflow would unconditionally call tcp_cleanup_rbuf() on all the
current subflows, potentially hitting a divide by zero error on
the newly created ones.

Explicitly check that the subflow is in a suitable state before
invoking tcp_cleanup_rbuf().

[ Conflicts in protocol.c, because commit f410cbea9f3d ("tcp: annotate
  data-races around tp->window_clamp") has not been backported to this
  version. The conflict is easy to resolve, because only the context is
  different, but not the line to modify. ]
