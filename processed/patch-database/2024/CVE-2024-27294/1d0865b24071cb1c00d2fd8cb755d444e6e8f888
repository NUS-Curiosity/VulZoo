 ## main branch
 
+### Security fix
+
+Certain Go tarballs (see below) had files owned by non-root users:
+
+    ❯ curl -SsL https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.14.darwin-amd64.tar.gz | tar -tzvf - | head -3
+    drwxr-xr-x  0 0      0           0 Feb  2 10:19 go/
+    -rw-r--r--  0 gopher wheel    1339 Feb  2 10:09 go/CONTRIBUTING.md
+    -rw-r--r--  0 gopher wheel    1479 Feb  2 10:09 go/LICENSE
+
+In this case, the non-root user in question mapped to the first user created on
+the macOS system (UID 501).
+
+When running as root, previous versions of dp-golang would preserve file
+ownership when extracting the tarball, even if `owner` was set to something
+else. **This meant that files, such as the `go` binary, ended up being writable
+by a non-root user.**
+
+This version of dp-golang enables [`tar`]’s `--no-same-owner` and
+`--no-same-permissions` flags, which cause files to be extracted as the user
+running Puppet, or as the user/group specified in the Puppet code.
