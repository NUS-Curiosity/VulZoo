Subject: net: nexthop: Initialize all fields in dumped nexthops

[ Upstream commit 6d745cd0e9720282cd291d36b9db528aea18add2 ]

struct nexthop_grp contains two reserved fields that are not initialized by
nla_put_nh_group(), and carry garbage. This can be observed e.g. with
strace (edited for clarity):

    # ip nexthop add id 1 dev lo
    # ip nexthop add id 101 group 1
    # strace -e recvmsg ip nexthop get id 101
    ...
    recvmsg(... [{nla_len=12, nla_type=NHA_GROUP},
                 [{id=1, weight=0, resvd1=0x69, resvd2=0x67}]] ...) = 52

The fields are reserved and therefore not currently used. But as they are, they
leak kernel memory, and the fact they are not just zero complicates repurposing
of the fields for new ends. Initialize the full structure.
