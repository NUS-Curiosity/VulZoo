 The Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header is a powerful tool used by web applications to mitigate the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and other types of code injection attacks. By specifying which content sources are trustworthy, CSP prevents the browser from loading malicious assets. Here's a breakdown of the CSP directive used:
 
 - `default-src 'self';` Only allow content from the site's own origin. This is the default policy for loading resources such as JavaScript, images, CSS, fonts, AJAX requests, frames, HTML5 media, and other data.
-- `script-src 'self' https://js.stripe.com https://unpkg.com;` Allow scripts to be loaded from the site's own origin, Stripe (for payment processing), and unpkg (a content delivery network for npm packages).
+- `script-src 'self' https://js.stripe.com;` Allow scripts to be loaded from the site's own origin and Stripe (for payment processing).
 - `img-src 'self' data: https:;` Allow images from the site's origin, inline images using data URIs, and images loaded over HTTPS from any origin.
 - `style-src 'self';` Only allow stylesheets from the site's own origin.
 - `frame-ancestors 'none';` Prevent the site from being framed (embedded within an <iframe>) by other sites, mitigating Clickjacking attacks.
