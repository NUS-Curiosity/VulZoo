+Security

+- After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays
+  the URL as yellow (`colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg`). However, when the
+  affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly
+  displayed as green (`colors.statusbar.url.success_https`). While the user
+  already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set
+  `content.ssl_strict` to `false` which is not recommended), this could still
+  provide a false sense of security. This is now fixed.
