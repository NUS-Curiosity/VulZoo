Metaphor's source code is now released! The source include a PoC that generates MP4 exploits in real-time and bypassing ASLR. The PoC includes lookup tables for Nexus 5 Build LRX22C with Android 5.0.1. Server-side of the PoC include simple PHP scripts that run the exploit generator - I'm using XAMPP to serve gzipped MP4 files. The attack page is index.php.

The exploit generator is written in Python and used by the PHP code.

usage: metaphor.py [-h] [-c CONFIG] -o OUTPUT {leak,rce,suicide} ...

positional arguments:
  {leak,rce,suicide}    Type of exploit to generate

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Override exploit configuration
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
