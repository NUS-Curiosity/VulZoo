Affected Component:
Function vcodec2_hls_filter in libvoipCodec_v7a.so

Attack Type:
Local

Attack vector:

POC:
Video at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x1Z3hm4j8f4rhv_WUp4gW-bhdtZMezdU

User must have sent or received a GIF file in WeChat
Malware app must retrieve the phoneâ€™s IMEI. For POC, we can use the
below command
adb shell service call iphonesubinfo 1 | awk -F "'" '{print $2}' | sed
'1 d' | tr -d '.' | awk '{print}' ORS=-
Produce the malicious emoji file with the retrieved IMEI (use
encrypt_wxgf.py in poc.zip):
python encrypt.py crash4.wxgf [SIZE_OF_EMOJI_ON_SDCARD]
Replace /sdcard/tencent/MicroMsg/[User_ID]/emoji/[WXGF_ID] with the
padded out.wxgf.encrypted
WeChat will crash now if a message that contains the overwritten emoji file
