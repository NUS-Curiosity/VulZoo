Zend Framework is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities and a weakness:

- Multiple cross-site scripting issues
- An HTML-injection issue
- A security-bypass weakness

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issues and HTML-injection issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

The attacker can exploit the security-bypass weakness in conjunction with other latent vulnerabilities to bypass certain security restrictions.

Versions prior to Zend Framework 1.7.9, 1.8.5, and 1.9.7 are vulnerable.
