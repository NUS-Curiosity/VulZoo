Trillian is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

To exploit this issue, an attacker must entice an unsuspecting user to load a malicious '.dtd' file. Successfully exploiting this issue may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges. Failed exploit attempts will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Trillian 3.1.9.0 Basic is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
