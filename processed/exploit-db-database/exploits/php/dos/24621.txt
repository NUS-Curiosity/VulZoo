The Pinnacle Systems ShowCenter web-based interface is reported prone to a remote denial of service vulnerability.

The issue exists due to a lack of sanity checks performed on the Skin parameter of a ShowCenter script.

It is reported that the affect of this attack will be persistent, any request for the ShowCenter web-based interface received subsequent to an attack will result in 'File or Folder not found' error message, as the interface fails to render.

A remote attacker may exploit this condition to persistently deny service to the ShowCenter web-based interface.
