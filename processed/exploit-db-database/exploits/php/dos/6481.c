|	Femitter FTP Server 1.03 (RETR) Remote Denial of Service Exploit PoC		|
|											|
|	Summary: Femitter Server is an easy-to use HTTP and FTP server application	|
|	for Windows which allows you to use your own computer for sharing gigabytes	|
|	of files with your friends and colleagues.					|
|											|
|	Desc: Femitter HTTP/FTP 1.03 suffers from a denial of service vulnerability	|
|	and memory corruption that causes the application to crash. When we send to	|
|	the RETR command an argument like AAAA:AAAA or an overly long string of As	|
|	(1024), the server crashes instantly. Also, when typing into browser:		|
|	ftp://127.0.0.1/\.. we traverse to the install folder of the program(CWD),	|
|	and when browsing to ftp://127.0.0.1/\..\/\..\ we get access violation at	|
|	address 004A218A in module "fem.exe". Write of address 00000000.		|

|	Producst web page: http://acritum.com/fem/index.htm				|
|											|
|	Tested on Microsoft Windows XP SP2 (English)					|
