MySQL is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit these issues to crash the database, denying access to legitimate users.

This issues affect versions prior to MySQL 5.1.49.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 42598 (Oracle MySQL Prior to 5.1.49 Multiple Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities) but has been given its own record to better document it.
