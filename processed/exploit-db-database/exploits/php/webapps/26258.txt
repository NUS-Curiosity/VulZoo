ATutor is prone to a remote information disclosure vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to perform proper access validation before granting access to privileged information.

A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability and make repeated GET requests for the chat logs, effectively retrieving all chat archives. Information obtained may aid an attacker in further attacks.
