phpWebSite is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A remote unauthorized user can disclose the contents of arbitrary local files through the use of directory traversal strings '../'. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a loss of confidentiality.

The vendor has released the patch phpwebsite_security_patch_20050705.2.tgz addressing this issue.
