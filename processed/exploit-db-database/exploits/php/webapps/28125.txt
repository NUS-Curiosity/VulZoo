The 'phpclassifieds.info' product is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities. The issues include HTML- and SQL-injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is rendered to the user, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Other attacks are also possible.
