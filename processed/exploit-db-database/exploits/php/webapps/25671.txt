NPDS is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability.

This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'thold' parameter.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

All versions are considered to be vulnerable at the moment.
