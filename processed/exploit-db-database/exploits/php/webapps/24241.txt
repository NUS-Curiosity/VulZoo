PowerPortal is reported prone to multiple vulnerabilities. The issues result from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. The following specific issues can affect the application:

PowerPortal is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. These cross-site scripting issues can permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link that includes hostile HTML and script code. If a user follows the malicious link, the attacker-supplied code executes in the Web browser of the victim computer. This attack can allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.

Additionally, PowerPortal is prone to an information disclosure vulnerability. It is reported that a remote attacker may reveal directory listings, by supplying directory traversal sequences to the 'modules.php' script.

The information disclosure vulnerability may be employed by the attacker in order to reveal potentially sensitive information regarding the layout of the filesystem on the affected computer.
