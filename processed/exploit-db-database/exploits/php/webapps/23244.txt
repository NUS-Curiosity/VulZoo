WrenSoft Zoom Search Engine is prone to a cross-site scripting issue in the software's search module. A remote attacker may be able to execute HTML or script code in a user's browser.

The problem occurs because the software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may be able to a construct a malicious link containing HTML or script code that may be rendered in a user's browser upon visiting that link. This attack would occur in the security context of the vulnerable site.
