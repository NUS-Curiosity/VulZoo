ProNews is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including multiple HTML-injection issues, an SQL-injection issue, and a cross-site scripting issue, because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or even exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Other attacks are also possible.

ProNews version 1.5 is vulnerable to these issues.
