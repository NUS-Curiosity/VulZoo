JPortal is reportedly affected by a remote SQL injection vulnerability in the print.inc.php script. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI input before using it in an SQL query.

As a result of this a malicious user may influence database queries in order to view or modify sensitive information, potentially compromising the software or the database. It may be possible for an attacker to disclose the administrator password hash by exploiting this issue.
