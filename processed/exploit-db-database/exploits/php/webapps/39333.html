The Elegance theme for WordPress is prone to a local file-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to adequately validate user-supplied input.

Exploiting this vulnerability would allow an attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from local files on computers running the vulnerable application. This may aid in further attacks.
