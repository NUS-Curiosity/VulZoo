Vikingboard is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities and a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to access sensitive information, to execute HTML and script code in the context of the affected site, to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or to control how the site is rendered to the user; further attacks are possible as well.

Version 1.0.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
