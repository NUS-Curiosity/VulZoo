AlstraSoft Affiliate Network Pro is affected by multiple input-validation vulnerabilities. These issues include multiple cross-site scripting isues and SQL-injection issues.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, execute arbitrary script code in the context of the webserver process, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
