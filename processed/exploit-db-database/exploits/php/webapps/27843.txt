MyBB is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful attack could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

MyBB 1.1.1 is reported to be affected to this issue. Other versions may be vulnerable as well.
