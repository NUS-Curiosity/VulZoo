Lisk CMS is prone to multiple SQL-injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is rendered to the user, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Lisk CMS 4.4 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example URIs are available:
