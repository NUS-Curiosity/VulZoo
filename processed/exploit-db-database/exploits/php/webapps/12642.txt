##[Cross Site Scripting]*
(Cross-Site Scripting attacks are a type of injection problem, in which
malicious scripts are injected into the otherwise benign and trusted web
sites. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web
application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side
script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed
are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a
user in the output it generates without validating or encoding it)

#
#
##[FULL PATH DICSLOSURE]**
(Full Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see the
path to the webroot/file. e.g.: /home/omg/htdocs/file/. Certain
vulnerabilities, such as using the load_file() (within a SQL Injection)
query to view the page source, require the attacker to have the full path to
the file they wish to view. (OWASP))
