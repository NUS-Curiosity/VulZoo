Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the VamCart v0.9 Content Management System.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). The persistent
vulnerabilities are located in the manage accounts, manage coupons, view orders or order comments module(s) with the bound
vulnerable parameters comment text, coupon code, title & name. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged application
user account. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                          [+] Account >  Manage Accounts > Admins Listing
                          [+] Manage Coupons & Listing
                          [+] View All Orders Listing
                          [+] Order Comments Listing

Vulnerable Module(s):
                          [+] Title
			  [+] Name
			  [+] Coupon Code
			  [+] Comments Text


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by low privileged user accounts with low required user inter action.
