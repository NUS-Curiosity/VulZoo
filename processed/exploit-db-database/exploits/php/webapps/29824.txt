QuizShock is prone to an HTML-injection scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would execute in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

QuizShock 1.5.5 through 1.6.1 are vulnerable.
