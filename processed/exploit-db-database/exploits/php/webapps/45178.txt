1. Description:
This plugin allows users to thank/like other users threads/posts. In user profiles it shows your most liked post/thread, the post/thread subjects aren't sanitized to user input.


2. Proof of Concept:

- Get that post/thread liked by another user (or you)
- Visit your profile to see alert.
