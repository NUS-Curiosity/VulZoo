NX5Linkx is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

An attacker may be able to exploit these issues to modify the logic of SQL queries. Successful exploits may allow the attacker to compromise the software, retrieve information, or modify data; other consequences are possible as well.
