php(Reactor) is prone to cross-site scripting attacks.

An attacker may create a malicious link to a php(Reactor) site which contains malicious HTML and script code. If this link is visited by a web user, the attacker-supplied code will execute in their web client, in the security context of the php(Reactor) site.

This may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate authenticated users. Other attacks are also possible.

This issue has been reported in php(Reactor) version 1.2.7pl1. Other versions may also be affected.
