----

Due to insufficient validation of client-side data, we can inject script directly into the file-based storage used for blog comments.

When making a new comment, we simply fill the "posted" hidden field's value with...

<script>alert('xss');<script>"

...for an XSS attack OR...

<script>window.location="http://bank.example/withdraw?account=bob&amount=1000000&for=mallory"</script>

...for a CRSF attack and otherwise submit the comment as usual.

Whenever that comment is viewed, the script is executed.
