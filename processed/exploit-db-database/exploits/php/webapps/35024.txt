The Joomla! Catalogue Component is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database. By using directory-traversal strings to execute local script code in the context of the application, the attacker may be able to obtain sensitive information that may aid in further attacks.
