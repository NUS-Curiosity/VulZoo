A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been reported for Basit. This vulnerability occurs due to insufficient sanitization of some user-supplied input. As a result of this deficiency an attacker may exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted URL that includes malicious HTML code as URI parameters for Basit's Search module.

This may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.
