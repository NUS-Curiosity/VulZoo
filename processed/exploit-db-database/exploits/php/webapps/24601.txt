BBS E-Market Professional is reported prone to multiple file disclosure vulnerabilities. These issues exist due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data.

A remote attacker can disclose arbitrary Web-readable files by supplying directory traversal sequences such as '../' to the server. This results in improper access to potentially sensitive files located outside of the document root of the web server.

BBS E-Market patch level bf_130 (v1.3.0) and prior are affected by these issues.
