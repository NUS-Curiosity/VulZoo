Wikidforum is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Wikidforum 2.10 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
