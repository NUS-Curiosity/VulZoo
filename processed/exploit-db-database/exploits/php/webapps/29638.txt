LoveCMS is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including an arbitrary-file-upload issue, a remote file-include issue, a local file-include issue, and a cross-site scripting issue.

An attacker can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, upload an arbitrary PHP file, execute the file on the vulnerable computer in the context of the webserver process, retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the affected application, and delete arbitrary files on the server.
