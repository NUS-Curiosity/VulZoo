## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection

## Description:
The `id` parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
A single quote was submitted in the id parameter, and a database error
message was returned. Two single quotes were then submitted and the
error message disappeared. The attacker easily can steal all
information from the database of this web application!
WARNING! All of you: Be careful what you buy! This will be your responsibility!
