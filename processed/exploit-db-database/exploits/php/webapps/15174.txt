Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware is prone to a local file-include vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit the local file-include vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to view and execute local files within the context of the webserver process. Information harvested may aid in further attacks.

The attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may let the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

The following applications are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

1. Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware 5.2 is vulnerable
2. Tiki Wiki CMS Groupware prior to 3.8

The following example URIs are available:

Local file Include:
