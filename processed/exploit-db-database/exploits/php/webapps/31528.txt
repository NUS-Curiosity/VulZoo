Le Forum is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute malicious PHP code in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.
