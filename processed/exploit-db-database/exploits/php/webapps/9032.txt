  I. BACKGROUND
    "osTicket is a widely-used open source support ticket system. It seamlessly
    integrates inquiries created via email and web-based forms into a simple
    easy to use multi-user web interface. Easily manage, organize and archive
    all your support requests and responses in one place while providing your
    clients with accountability and responsiveness they deserve." [1]

  II. DETAILS
    osTicket prior to v1.6 RC5 fails to validate / escape staff usernames which
    can be abused to execute a blind sql injection attack by an unauthenticated
    attacker.

    The vendor has provided a new release v1.6 RC5 which addresses this vulnerability.
    They have also provided patching instructions [2] should you be unable to perform
    a full upgrade at this time.

    One sample attack string might look similar to the following:
    '+(SELECT IF(SUBSTRING(passwd,1,1)=CHAR(48),BENCHMARK(1000000,SHA1(1)),0) passwd
    FROM ost_staff where staff_id=1) and '1'='1
