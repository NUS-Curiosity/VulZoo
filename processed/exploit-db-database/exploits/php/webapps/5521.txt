Description
SugarCRM Community Edition is vulnerable to local file contents disclosure. This
vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious user to disclose potentially sensitive
information. The flaw is caused due to a lack of input filtering in the SugarCRM RSS
module, which can be exploited to disclose the content of local files.
The RSS module allows SugarCRM users to add RSS feeds to their personal RSS list. The application expects an
URL value pointing to a valid RSS feed. However, the URL variable value is not properly sanitised and any URI
value can be entered instead. In this particular case, it was discovered that it is possible to enter a file path to
any files on the local system hosting the SugarCRM application.
As a result SugarCRM does not display the new RSS feed in the list as it is not a valid RSS URL Feed. However,
the application creates a local file with the filename of the md5 hash of the URL entered. The file is created in
the directory cache/feeds . If the Apache web server is used, the file is created with the user www-data
containing read permission.

Exploitation
An exploitation example in a LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP) environment:
If an authenticated attacker enters a value of â€œ/etc/passwdâ€ (without quotes) in the RSS URL field, the
application will generate a MD5 hash of the string containing the file path. In this case, the value â€œ/etc/passwdâ€
is hashed to â€œc5068b7c2b1707f8939b283a2758a691â€ (without quotes). The MD5 hash is then used as a
filename with the file contents of /etc/passwd. The file /etc/passwd can then be viewable publicly at
http://sugarwebsiteaddress/cache/feeds/c5068b7c2b1707f8939b283a2758a691 .

Exploitation of this flaw does not require authentication.
The URL variable is handled by the /modules/Feeds/Feed.php page. The array variable $url is passed without
filtering to the xml_domit_rss_document function at the following line:
$rssdoc = new xml_domit_rss_document ($this->url, â€˜cache/feeds/â€™, 3600);
The XML domit RSS plugin is then called and retrieves the file content at the path given and then generate the
MD5 hashed file in the cache/feeds folder as instructed by the function in Feed.php .

Solution
Install the vendor supplied patches.
