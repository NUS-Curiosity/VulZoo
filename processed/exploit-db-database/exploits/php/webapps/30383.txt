Vikingboard is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Vikingboard 0.1.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
