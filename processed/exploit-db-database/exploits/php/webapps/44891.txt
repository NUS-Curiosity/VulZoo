### PoC ###

In the REDAXO CMS under version 5.6.0 the mediapool addon is vuln. Users who have an user-account, like editor,
can use the mediapool to upload files. The mediapool addon under version 2.4.0 uses a blacklist for fileupload.
For users it isn't possible upload files named: php, php4, php5, php6 or php7.

But, if you name the files like php71 or php53 the blacklist-function ignore this and upload of shellcode-file is possible.
