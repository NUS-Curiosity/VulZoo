Flatnux suffers of multiple local file inclusions: (output of my scanner)

Line: 10

As you can see the script checks for .php .php3/4/5 extensions but what about
.phtml extension?
Depending of web server configuration .phtml can be interpreted as php code.

To upload a file you need a valid login.

You can get the upload module at the URLs:

- /path/index.php?mod=08_Files
where 08 is the default number but it can be different (max 20 i think)

or
- /path/index.php?mod=none_Files


Remember that you need aÃ¹to be authenticated.

Now upload your shell with .phtml extension and retrieve its link.

If the web server does not interprets .phtml files as php files you can
upload a .txt file with malicious code (ex <? system($cmd);?>)

And include it with one of local file inclusions reported before.
So you can obtain a Remote Command Execution depending of php.ini configuration becouse lfi's works with:

register_globals = On
magic_quotes_gpc = Off

Too see the php.ini configuration you can use this phpinfo() disclosure:

- /path/sections/none_Control_Center/phpinfo.php
or
- /path/sections/10_Control_Center/phpinfo.php
where 10 can be different number (max 20 i think)
