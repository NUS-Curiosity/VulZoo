It has been reported that osCommerce may be prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability that may allow an attacker to construct a malicious link containing HTML or script code that may be rendered in a user's browser.

Successful exploitation of this attack may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

Although unconfirmed, osCommerce versions 2.2 Milestone 1 and 2.2 Milestone 2 may be vulnerable to this issue.
