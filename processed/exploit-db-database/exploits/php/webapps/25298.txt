Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered SQL injection vulnerability in b2evolution, which can be exploited to alter SQL requests passed to the vulnerable application's database.


1) SQL Injection in b2evolution: CVE-2013-2945

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of HTTP GET parameter "show_statuses" in "/blogs/admin.php" script. A remote authenticated administrator can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database.

Depending on database and system configuration, PoC code below will create a "/tmp/file.txt" file, containing MySQL version:

http://[host]/blogs/admin.php?submit=Search&ctrl=items&tab=full&blog=1&show_statuses[]=1') )) UNION SELECT version() INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/file.txt' --


This vulnerability is also exploitable via CSRF vector, since the application is prone to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. In order to do so an attacker should trick a logged-in administrator to visit malicious web page with CSRF exploit.

Basic CSRF exploit:

<img src="http://[host]/blogs/admin.php?submit=Search&ctrl=items&tab=full&blog=1&show_statuses[]=1') )) UNION SELECT version() INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/file.txt' --">
