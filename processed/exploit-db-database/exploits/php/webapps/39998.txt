YetiForce CRM was built on a rock-solid Vtiger foundation, but has hundreds of changes that help to accomplish even the most challenging tasks in the simplest way

YetiForce is vulnerable to a stored XSS vulnerability present within a users comment section.

POC:

Within 'Companies & Accounts > Accounts' select your prefered user, and then in the 'Comments' section input;

<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS');>

Either refresh the current page, or navigate back to 'Accounts'
