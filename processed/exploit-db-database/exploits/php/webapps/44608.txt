# CVE: CVE-2018-10580


1. Description:
Adds a new section to user profiles that will display their last posts.


2. Proof of Concept:

Persistent XSS
- Create a thread with the following subject <script>alert('XSS')</script>
- Now visit your profile to see the alert.


3. Solution:
I reported the plugin twice over the past 3 weeks and recieved no response.


The following should be added in line 236 to properly sanitize thread subjects.

$d['tsubject'] = htmlspecialchars_uni($d['tsubject']);
