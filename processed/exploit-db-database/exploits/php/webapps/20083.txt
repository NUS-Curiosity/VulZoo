=====================
Vulnerability Details
=====================

Plugin does not properly filter filetypes, which allows for the upload of filetypes in the following format:

     filename.php.jpg

Vulnerable hosts will serve such files as a php file, allowing for malicious files to be uploaded and executed.

In creating the uploads folder for this plugin, the code utilizes uniqid to add a unique string to the upload folder name in order to better hide it from direct access.

Example:

     /wp-content/uploads/feu_9fc12558ac71e6995808cfc590207e87/

However, many WordPress installations allow direct access to the /wp-content/uploads/ folder, so simply look for a folder name beginning with 'feu_' to locate your upload.
