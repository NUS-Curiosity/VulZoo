Schoolhos CMS is prone to an arbitrary file-upload vulnerability and multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker could exploit these issues to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser in the context of the affected site or execute arbitrary code on the server.

Schoolhos CMS 2.29 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
