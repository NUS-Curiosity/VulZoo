Kayako ESupport is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Multiple parameters of the 'index.php' script can be exploited to pass malicious HTML and script code to the application.

This would occur in the security context of the affected Web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

ESupport 2.3 is reported vulnerable, however, it is possible that other versions are affected as well.
