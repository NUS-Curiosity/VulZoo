# Software Link: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14906/simple-water-refilling-station-management-system-php-free-source-code.html
# Version: 1.0
# Tested On: Windows Server 2019 and XAMPP 7.4.22

# The Simple Water Refilling Station Management System
# is vulnerable to a SQL Injection because it fails to sufficiently sanitize
# user-supplied data before using it in a SQL query.  Successful exploitation
# of this issue could allow an attacker to bypass the application's
# authentication controls and possibly access other sensitive data.

# Vulnerable Code: Line 21 in water_refilling/classes/Login.php

qry = $this->conn->query("SELECT * from users where username = '$username' and password = md5('$password') ");
