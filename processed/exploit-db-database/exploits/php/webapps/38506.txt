NetApp OnCommand System Manager is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits will allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

NetApp OnCommand System Manager 2.1, 2.0.2 and prior versions are vulnerable.
