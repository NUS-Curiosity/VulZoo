>> #1 Vulnerability
Type = XSS
Affected Input Boxes = "Name", "Vorname", "Land", "Message"

The guestbook fails to properly sanitize the user input when a new entry is added.
When HTML/Java Script code is added, it gets displayed/parsed when the new entry was
successfully submitted.

Furthermore the code gets executed when the admin views the entries in the control panel.
It is even possible to temporarily disable the admin features in the backend
since the injected code gets executed before the admin buttons get displayed.
When the correct code was injected, the design gets destroyed and the admin buttons disappear.
