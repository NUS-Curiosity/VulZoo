php4dvd is prone to a remote PHP code-injection vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code in the context of the affected application. This may facilitate a compromise of the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

php4dvd 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
