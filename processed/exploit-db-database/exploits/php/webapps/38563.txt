HP Insight Diagnostics is prone to a local file include vulnerability because it fails to adequately validate user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain potentially sensitive information and execute arbitrary local scripts. This could allow the attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

HP Insight Diagnostics 9.4.0.4710 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
