Internet Explorer is affected by a URI-spoofing vulnerability because it fails to adequately handle specific combinations of the non-breaking space character ('&NBSP;').

An attacker may leverage this issue to spoof the source URI of a site presented to an unsuspecting user. This may lead to a false sense of trust because the user may be presented with a source URI of a trusted site while interacting with the attacker's malicious site.

Internet Explorer 6 is affected by this issue.
