Multiple remote input-validation vulnerabilities affect phpCOIN because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it to carry out critical functionality.

An attacker may leverage these issues to manipulate and view arbitrary database contents (by exploiting various SQL-injection issues) and to run arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user (by exploiting multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities).
