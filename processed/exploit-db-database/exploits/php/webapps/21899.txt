phpWebSite is prone to cross-site scripting attacks.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of HTML tags from URI parameters processed by the 'article.php' script. As a result, an attacker may construct a malicious link to this script which contains arbitrary HTML and script code.

When the malicious link is visited by a web user, the attacker-supplied code will be executed by their web client in the context of the site hosting the vulnerable software.
