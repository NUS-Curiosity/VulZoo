If we try to login as a voter and catch the login request in burp then pass it to sql map then we can put our payload in voter parameter

Vulnerable code

```

Path :- /votersystem/login.php


<?php

    session_start();

    include 'includes/conn.php';


    if(isset($_POST['login'])){

        $voter = $_POST['voter']; <- vulnerable parameter

        $password = $_POST['password'];


        $sql = "SELECT * FROM voters WHERE voters_id = '$voter'";  <-
Passed unsanitized input

        $query = $conn->query($sql);


        if($query->num_rows < 1){

            $_SESSION['error'] = 'Cannot find voter with the ID';

        }

        else{

            $row = $query->fetch_assoc();

            if(password_verify($password, $row['password'])){

                $_SESSION['voter'] = $row['id'];

            }

            else{

                $_SESSION['error'] = 'Incorrect password';

            }

        }



    }

    else{

        $_SESSION['error'] = 'Input voter credentials first';

    }


    header('location: index.php');


?>
