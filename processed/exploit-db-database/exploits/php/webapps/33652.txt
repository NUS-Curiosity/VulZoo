New-CMS is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities and an HTML-Injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit the local file-include vulnerabilities using directory-traversal strings to view and execute a crafted 'cmd.php' script within the context of the webserver process. Information harvested may aid in further attacks.

The attacker may leverage the HTML-Injection issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may let the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

New-CMS 1.08 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
