I. BACKGROUND
Visitor Data Module shows the visitor's data on your live site (Their IP, Proxy(if used),
Country, ISP, Browser, Operating System).
Based on GeoIP (www.maxmind.com).

II. DESCRIPTION
Some technical issues were originally published in the following post:
http://elotrolad0.blogspot.com/2010/05/modvisitordata-joomla-remoce-code.html

with whom originally exploit the error, as r0i like to thank, who Realizing the
proof of concept.


III. ANALYSIS
The bug is in the following files, specifying the lines

file:
/modules/mod_VisitorData/tmpl/default.php

line:
[47] if (isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'])) {
[48] 		$whois ="whois " . $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'] ." | grep netname";
[49] 	}
[50] 	else{
[51] 		$whois ="whois " . $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] ." | grep netname";
[52] 	}
[53]
[54] 	$isp_user = exec($whois);


explaining the code: what to do is get our ip, and if it passes through any proxy other
than q are also other issues in the code as the country of connection, image, browser,
operating system. As can be seen to see if it goes through a proxy using the exec (),
line 54, reason that allows you to run remote commands.
If the conditional check whether to park in the header HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR,if this
happens take this value otherwise take REMOTE_ADDR, 2 may be present at one time.

command to run only can we add X-Forwarded-For in the header to take this value and
run exec () which is what we are interested.

IV. EXPLOITATION
You have to add
X-Forwarded-For:;[command-here];1
