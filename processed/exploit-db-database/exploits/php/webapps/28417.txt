ToendaCMS is prone a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to include an arbitrary remote file containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

This issue affects ToendaCMS 1.0.3 and prior; other versions may also be affected.

Update: This BID is retired due to further analysis showing that this is not a vulnerability.
