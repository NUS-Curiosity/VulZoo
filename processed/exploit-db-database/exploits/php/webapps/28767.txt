ackerTodo is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

These issues affect ackerTodo version 4.2; other versions may also be vulnerable.
