ATutor is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

ATutor 1.0 is vulnerable, other versions may also be affected.
