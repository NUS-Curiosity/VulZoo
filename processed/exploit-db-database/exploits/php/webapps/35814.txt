TEDE Simplificado is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

TEDE Simplificado v1.01 and vS2.04 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
