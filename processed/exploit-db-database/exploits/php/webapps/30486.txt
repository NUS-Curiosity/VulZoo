Lib2 PHP Library is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Lib2 PHP Library 0.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
