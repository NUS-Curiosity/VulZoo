DSM Light has been reported to be prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI input.

This issue would allow an attacker to view arbitrary, web-readable files on the affected computer. This may aid an attacker in conducting further attacks against the vulnerable computer.
