SquirrelMail is reported to be prone to a 'from' field email header HTML injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied email header strings.

An attacker can exploit this issue to gain access to an unsuspecting user's cookie based authentication credentials; disclosure of personal email is possible. Other attacks are also possible.
