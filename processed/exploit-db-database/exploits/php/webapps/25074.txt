Xoops Incontent module is reported prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A malicious user could issue a request containing directory traversal strings such as '../' to possibly view files outside the server root directory.

Incontent version 3.0 is reported to be susceptible to this vulnerability. Other versions may also be affected.
