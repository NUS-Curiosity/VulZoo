 MantisBT <=1.2.3 (db_type) Cross-Site Scripting & Path Disclosure Vulnerability


 Vendor: MantisBT Group
 Product web page: http://www.mantisbt.org
 Version affected: <1.2.4

 Summary: MantisBT is a free popular web-based bugtracking system. It is written in the PHP
 scripting language and works with MySQL, MS SQL, and PostgreSQL databases and a webserver.
 MantisBT has been installed on Windows, Linux, Mac OS, OS/2, and others. Almost any web
 browser should be able to function as a client. It is released under the terms of the GNU
 General Public License (GPL).

 Desc: Mantis Bug Tracker suffers from a cross-site scripting and a path disclosure
 vulnerability. The XSS issue is triggered when input passed via the "db_type" parameter
 to the admin/upgrade_unattended.php script is not properly sanitised before being returned
 to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's
 browser session in context of an affected site. The PD weakness is caused due to the
 application displaying the full installation path in an error report, when supplying an
 invalid "db_type" parameter to the admin/upgrade_unattended.php script.

 Tested on: Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 (English)
            Debian GNU/Linux (squeeze)
            Apache 2.2.14 (Win32)
            MySQL 5.1.41
            PHP 5.3.1
