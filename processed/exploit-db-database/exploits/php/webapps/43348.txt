        $forbidden_types = array('html', 'htm', 'js', 'jsb', 'mhtml', 'mht',

Recommended Patch:
We were not able to get the vendor to respond in any way, the software
appears to have been left abandoned without support â€“ though this is not an
official status on their site (last official patch was released on
2012-11-29), the GitHub appears a bit more active (last commit from 2 years
ago).

The patch that addresses this bug is available here:
