All In One Control Panel (AIOCP) is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, access or modify sensitive data, execute arbitrary script code in the context of the application, compromise the application and possibly exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

AIOCP 1.3.007 and prior versions are vulnerable.
