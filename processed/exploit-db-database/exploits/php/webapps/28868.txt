PLS-Bannieres is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to include an arbitrary remote file containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Version 1.21 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.

This BID is being retired because further analysis reveals that the application is not vulnerable to this issue.
