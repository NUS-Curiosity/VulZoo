I. ABOUT THE APPLICATION
________________________

This  component  allows  you  to  present  your  users a
highscore-enabled game-area.It is based on the all known
joomlaflashgames, but with more features and with better
scoring method. You  can create own categories for games
and  let  your  site-visitors  have fun,  so  they  will
return.


II. DESCRIPTION
_______________

Some parameters  are not properly sanitised before being
used in SQL queries.


III. ANALYSIS
_____________

Summary:

 A) Multiple Blind SQL Injection


A) Multiple Blind SQL Injection
_______________________________

Many  parameters  in  various  files such as battle.php,
scores.php  etc. are not properly sanitised before being
used in SQL queries.  Because  of the number of flaws, I
can't report the entire vulnerable code;  but  I can say
that  most  of the numeric fields have not been properly
checked.
