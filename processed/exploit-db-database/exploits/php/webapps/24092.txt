It has been reported that PHPX is affected by multiple administrator command execution vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly validate access to administrative commands.

This issue could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link or embed a malicious URI between bbCode image tags, which includes hostile HTML and script code. If an unsuspecting forum administrator activated this URI, the attacker-supplied command would be carried out with the administrator's privileges. This would occur in the security context of the affected web site and would cause various administrator actions to be taken.
