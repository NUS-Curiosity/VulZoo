# 1. Technical Description
# Wordpress Plugin Import Export WordPress Users version 1.3.1. and before are affected by Remote Code
# Execution through the CSV injection vulnerability. This allows any application user to inject commands
# as part of the fields of his profile and these commands are executed when a user with greater privilege
# exports the data in CSV and opens that file on his machine.

# 2. Vulnerable code
# The function do_export() from WF_CustomerImpExpCsv_Exporter class does not check if fields beggings
# with (=, +, -, @) characters so the fields name, surname, alias or display_name are vulnerable to CSV Injection.

# 3. Proof Of Concept (PoC)
# 3.1 Login with subscriber user and change the fields First name, Surname and Alias with payloads.
# 3.2 Login with a high privileges user and export all users to CSV.
# 3.3 When the user with high privileges logs in to the application, export data in CSV and opens the
# generated file, the command is executed and the shell will run open on the machine.
