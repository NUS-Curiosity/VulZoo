Crafty Syntax Live Help is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability and a path-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information and compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Crafty Syntax Live Help versions 2.x and versions 3.x are vulnerable.
