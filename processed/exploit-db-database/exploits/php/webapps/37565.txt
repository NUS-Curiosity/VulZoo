Mahara is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied text.

Successful exploits will allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

Mahara versions prior to 1.5.2 and prior to 1.4.3 are vulnerable.
