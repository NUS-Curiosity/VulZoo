SysHotel On Line System is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to execute local script code in the context of the application. This may allow the attacker to access sensitive information that may aid in further attacks.
