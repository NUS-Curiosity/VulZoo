Koobi is prone to a script injection vulnerability.

An attacker can nest BBCode URL tags to trigger this issue and execute arbitrary code in a user's browser.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be able to access properties of the site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

Koobi 5 is reportedly prone to this vulnerability.
