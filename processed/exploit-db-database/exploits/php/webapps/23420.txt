Bitfolge Snif is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. As a result, hostile HTML and script code may be embedded in a malicious link to a site hosting the vulnerable software. If such a link is visited by a victim user, the attacker-supplied code may render in their web browser in the context of the site.

This issue was reported in version 1.2.6. Other versions are also likely affected.
