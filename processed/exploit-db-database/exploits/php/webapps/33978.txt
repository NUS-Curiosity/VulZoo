TomatoCMS is prone to a SQL-injection vulnerability and multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database or to execute HTML and script code in the context of the affected site, to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

TomatoCMS 2.0.6 and prior are vulnerable.
