AgileBill is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly santize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Version 1.4.92 is reported to be affected; earlier versions may also be vulnerable.
