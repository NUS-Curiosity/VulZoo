InfraPower PPS-02-S Q213V1 Insecure Direct Object Reference Authorization Bypass


Vendor: Austin Hughes Electronics Ltd.
Product web page: http://www.austin-hughes.com
Affected version: Q213V1 (Firmware: V2395S)
Fixed version: Q216V3 (Firmware: IPD-02-FW-v03)

Summary: InfraPower Manager PPS-02-S is a FREE built-in GUI of each
IP dongle ( IPD-02-S only ) to remotely monitor the connected PDUs.
Patented IP Dongle provides IP remote access to the PDUs by a true
network IP address chain. Only 1xIP dongle allows access to max. 16
PDUs in daisy chain - which is a highly efficient cient application
for saving not only the IP remote accessories cost, but also the true
IP addresses required on the PDU management.

Desc: Insecure Direct Object References occur when an application
provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input. As
a result of this vulnerability attackers can bypass authorization
and access resources and functionalities in the system directly, for
example APIs, files, upload utilities, device settings, etc.

Tested on: Linux 2.6.28 (armv5tel)
           lighttpd/1.4.30-devel-1321
           PHP/5.3.9
           SQLite/3.7.10
