Info:

GigPress is a powerful WordPress plugin designed for musicians and other
performers. Manage all of your upcoming and past performances right from
within the WordPress admin, and display them on your site using simple
shortcodes, PHP template tags, or the GigPress widget on your
WordPress-powered website.

Details:


The user must have "contributer" priv atleast or whatever role the admin
decides would be suitable for event submission, failure to sanitize the
"Notes" field in the "Add A Show" section under "GigPress" Dashboard allows
an attacker to inject malicious HTML code, attacking any user viewing the
page where the malicious show is posted.

POC:

<script>alert('w00t');</script>

Solution:

Upgrade to latest plug-in version
