Coppermine Photo Gallery is reported prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, some of which may lead to arbitrary command execution. These issues occur because the application fails to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied input before using it in dynamic content and in function calls that execute system commands.

Attackers may exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, map the application root directory of the affected application, execute arbitrary commands, and include arbitrary files. Other attacks are also possible.
