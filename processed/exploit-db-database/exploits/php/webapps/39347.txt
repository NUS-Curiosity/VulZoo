Trixbox is prone to the following security vulnerabilities:

1. An SQL-injection vulnerability
2. A cross-site scripting vulnerability
3. Multiple local file-include vulnerabilities
4. A remote code-execution vulnerability

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database or perform certain unauthorized actions and gain access to the affected application.
