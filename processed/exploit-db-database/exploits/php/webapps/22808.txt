It has been reported that pMachine is prone to remote a patch disclosure vulnerability when accessing various scripts.

When a request is made for a target PHP script, possibly requiring a blank URI parameter, pMachine is said to throw an exception. When this occurs, the resulting error page discloses the installation directory of the respective PHP script.
