OpenBMCS 2.4 Unauthenticated SSRF / RFI


Vendor: OPEN BMCS
Product web page: https://www.openbmcs.com
Affected version: 2.4

Summary: Building Management & Controls System (BMCS). No matter what the
size of your business, the OpenBMCS software has the ability to expand to
hundreds of controllers. Our product can control and monitor anything from
a garage door to a complete campus wide network, with everything you need
on board.

Desc: Unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Remote File Include
(RFI) vulnerability exists in OpenBMCS within its functionalities. The application
parses user supplied data in the POST parameter 'ip' to query a server IP on port
81 by default. Since no validation is carried out on the parameter, an attacker
can specify an external domain and force the application to make an HTTP request
to an arbitrary destination host. This can be used by an external attacker for
example to bypass firewalls and initiate a service and network enumeration on the
internal network through the affected application, allows hijacking the current
session of the user, execute cross-site scripting code or changing the look of
the page and content modification on current display.
