Maian Survey is prone to a URI-redirection vulnerability and a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary local files within the context of the webserver process or redirect users to a potentially malicious site. This may aid in phishing attacks or allow the attacker to compromise the application; other attacks are also possible.

Maian Survey 1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
