Phorum is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including an unauthorized-access issue, privilege-escalation issue, multiple SQL-injection issues, and cross-site scripting issues, because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify sensitive data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Phorum 5.1.20 is affected; prior versions may also be vulnerable.

Let's try to add group named "war'axe":

http://localhost/phorum.5.1.20/admin.php?module=groups

Edit groups / Add group --> war'axe
