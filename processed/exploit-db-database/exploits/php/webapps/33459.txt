DieselPay is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to obtain sensitive information, execute arbitrary script code, or steal cookie-based authentication credentials.

DieselPay 1.6 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example URIs are available:
