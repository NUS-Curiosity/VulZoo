Exploit Description:
This exploit will automatically log you in and change the email to any registered user except for the admin that is installed with the web application.
Click on "Become a member" on the target website to insert the appropriate cookies for this to work.
Once the exploit takes place proceed to click "Modify" and change the password. To see if the user has some sort of admin privileges go to site.com/admin/ while still logged in. If they do it will say "Vic_username, enter your password:" and login with the password you just changed it to.

I cannot be held accountable for anything you do with this exploit. You take responsibility for your own actions. For educational and testing purposes only.
