Invision Power Board is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

This issue reportedly affects Invision Power Board version 2.0.1; other versions may also be vulnerable.
