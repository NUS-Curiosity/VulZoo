W3 Total Cache plugin for WordPress is prone to a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit the cross-site request forgery issue to perform unauthorized actions in the context of a logged-in user of the affected application. This may aid in other attacks.

W3 Total Cache 0.9.4 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
