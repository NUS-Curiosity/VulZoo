Flatnux is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities:

1. An HTML-injection vulnerability
2. A cross-site request-forgery vulnerability
3. A directory-traversal vulnerability

Successful exploits will allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, obtain sensitive information, or control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

The following versions are vulnerable:

Flatnux 2011-08.09.2
Flatnux 2011-2012-01.03.3
Flatnux 2011-minimal-2012-01.03.3
