SQL Injection:
SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker
to alter the SQL queries made to the database. This can be used to
retrieve some sensitive information, like database structure, tables,
columns, and their underlying data.

Attack Vector:
An attacker can gain admin panel access using malicious sql injection queri=
es.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open admin login page using following URl:
-> http://localhost/admin/login.html

2. Now put below Payload in both the fields( User ID & Password)
Payload: admin' or '1'='1

3. Server accepted our payload and we bypassed admin panel without any
credentials,

IMPACT:
if any attacker can gain admin panel access than they can Update &
Delete Userdata

Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions
Parameterized queries should be used to separate the command and data
portions of the intended query to the database. These queries prevent
an attacker from tampering with the query logic and extending a
concatenated database query string. Code reviews should be conducted
to identify any additional areas were the application or other
applications in the organization are vulnerable to this attack.
Additionally, input validation should be enforced on the server side
in order to ensure that only expected data is sent in queries. Where
possible security specific libraries should be used in order to
provide an additional layer of protection.
