All4WWW-Homepagecreator is affected by an arbitrary remote file include vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an 'include()' function call.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process.
