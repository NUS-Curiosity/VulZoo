CVE: CVE-2018-10365


1. Description:
When editing a thread the user is given to the option to convert the thread to a link.


2. Proof of Concept:

Persistent XSS
- Edit a thread or post you've made
- At the bottom of the edit page in the Thread Link box input the following <a """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">
- Now visit the forum your thread/post exists in to see the alert.


3. Solution:
The plugin has since been removed after notifying the author.

Patch in line 83:
$thread['tlink'] = ($thread['tlink']);

to

$thread['tlink'] = htmlspecialchars_uni($thread['tlink']);
