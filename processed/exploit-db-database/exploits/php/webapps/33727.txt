wh-em.com upload is prone to an authentication-bypass vulnerability because it fails to adequately verify user-supplied input used for cookie-based authentication.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrative access to the affected application, which may aid in further attacks.

wh-em.com upload 7.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example data is available:

javascript:document.cookie="whem_Name=adm_user;path=/";
javascript:document.cookie="whem_Password=adm_user;path=/";
