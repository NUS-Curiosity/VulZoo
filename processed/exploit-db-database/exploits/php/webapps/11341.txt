##[Cross Site Scripting]
(Cross-Site Scripting attacks are a type of injection problem, in which malicious scripts are injected into the otherwise benign and trusted web sites. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user in the output it generates without validating or encoding it)

##[Open Redirection:]
(OWASP: An open redirect is an application that takes a parameter and redirects a user to the parameter value without any validation. This vulnerability is used in phishing attacks to get users to visit malicious sites without realizing it.)
The admin login page (http://server/syssite/shopadmin/login.php) redirect the none-authentication users
the the "document.referrer" page. The attacker can exploit the mechanism to trick the victim like that:
#
#
HTTP REQUEST:
GET /syssite/shopadmin/login.php HTTP/1.1
Host: [SERVER]
Referer: http://www.PHISHING.com
#
the user will be sent to the original page but will be redirected to the PHISHING site.
#
the vulnerable code is: (in: http://server/syssite/shopadmin/login.php)
