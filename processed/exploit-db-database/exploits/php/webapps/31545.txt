GeeCarts is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including remote file-include and cross-site scripting issues, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system or execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site; other attacks are also possible.

All versions of GeeCarts are reported vulnerable.
