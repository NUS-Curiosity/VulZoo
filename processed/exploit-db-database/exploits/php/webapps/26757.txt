ThWboard is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities.

The application is vulnerable to HTML injection, cross-site scripting, and SQL injection; these issues are due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.

A remote attacker may inject SQL, HTML and script code resulting in theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, arbitrary script code execution, and the passing of malicious input to the underlying database application.

Version 3 beta 2.8 is vulnerable; other versions may be affected.
