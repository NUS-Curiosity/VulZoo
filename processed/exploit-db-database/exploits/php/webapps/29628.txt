Magic News Pro is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. These issues include a remote file-include issue and two cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary PHP code in the context of the webserver process or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. This may facilitate a compromise of the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

These issues affects version 1.0.2; other versions may also be vulnerable.
