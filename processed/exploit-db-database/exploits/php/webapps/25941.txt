MyGuestbook is prone to a remote file include vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.
