It is reported that phpCMS is susceptible to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to including it in dynamically generated Web pages.

It is reported that in order for phpCMS to be vulnerable, it must be configured with one, or both of 'STEALTH', or 'STEALTH_SECURE' modes being disabled.

This issue could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link that includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were to be followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the security context of the affected web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

Versions prior to 1.2.1pl1 are reportedly affected by this issue.
