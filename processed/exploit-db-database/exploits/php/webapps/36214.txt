BuzzScripts BuzzyWall is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to download local files in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information; other attacks are also possible.

BuzzyWall 1.3.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
