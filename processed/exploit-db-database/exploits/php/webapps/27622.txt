Dokeos is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
