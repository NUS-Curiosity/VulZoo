# Affected Version: 1.0
# Vulnerable parameter: "name" (POST method)
# Tested on: Linux, PHP/7.4.11

Explaination:
The source of "/admin_pages/login.php" file defines the following lines of code:

$name=$_POST['name'];
$password=$_POST['password'];
$result=mysqli_query($conn,"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='$name' AND Password='$password'");

which are called when trying to log into the administrative panel at "/admin_pages/login.php" itself.

Proof Of Concept:

The user input is not properly sanitized and this leads to authentication bypass through the classic "<username>' or '1' = '1 -- -" where <username> has to be a valid username. For example, the default username is "florian".
