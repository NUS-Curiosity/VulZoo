bloofoxCMS is prone to the following security vulnerabilities:

1. Multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities
2. Multiple cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities
3. A local file-include vulnerability

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script codes, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, obtain sensitive information, execute arbitrary server-side script code or bypass certain security restrictions to perform unauthorized actions.

bloofoxCMS 0.5.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
