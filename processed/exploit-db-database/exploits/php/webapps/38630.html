phpVibe is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability and multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit these issues to obtain potentially sensitive information or execute malicious PHP code in the context of the web server process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying computer; other attacks are also possible.

phpVibe 3.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
