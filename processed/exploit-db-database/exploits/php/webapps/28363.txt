CLUB-Nuke is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Version 2.0 LCID 2048 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
