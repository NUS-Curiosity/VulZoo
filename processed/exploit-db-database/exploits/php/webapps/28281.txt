PHPBB-Auction is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

These vulnerabilities could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in the modification of query logic or other attacks.

A successful attack could allow an attacker to compromise the software, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
