It has been reported that DeskPro is prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. The problem is reported to be present in various parameters such as cat, article, and ticketid of the faq.php and view.php modules. This issue may allow a remote attacker to influence SQL query logic in order to compromise the DeskPro application or view/modify sensitive information. The consequences of exploitation may vary depending on the underlying database implementation.

DeskPro version 1.1.0 and prior have been reported to be prone to this issue, however other versions may also be affected.
