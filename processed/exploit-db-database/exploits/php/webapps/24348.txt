It is reported that eNdonesia is susceptible to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to including it in dynamically generated web content.

As a result of this vulnerability, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user. Specifically the attacker can pass malicious HTML code as a value for the affected URI parameter supplied to 'mod.php'. All code will be executed within the context of the website running the vulnerable software.

This may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.

Version 8.3 of the software is reported vulnerable. Other versions may also be affected.
