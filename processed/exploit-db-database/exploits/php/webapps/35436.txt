Xinha is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Xinha 0.96.1 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected. Note that applications that use vulnerable versions of Xinha may also be affected.
