Galerie Dezign-Box is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. These issues include a cross-site scripting vulnerability and multiple file-upload vulnerabilities.

Attackers may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

An attacker can exploit the file-upload issues to upload arbitrary code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation; other attacks are also possible.
