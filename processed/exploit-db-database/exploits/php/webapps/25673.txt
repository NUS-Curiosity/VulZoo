JGS-Portal is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation of the SQL injection issues could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issues to have arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.
