Siteframe Beaumont is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be executed in the context of the affected website, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

This issue is reported to affect Siteframe Beaumont versions 5.0.2 and earler; other versions may also be vulnerable.
