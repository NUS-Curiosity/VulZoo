Dawaween is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

Successful exploits could allow a remote attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Dawaween 1.03 is affected by this issue.
