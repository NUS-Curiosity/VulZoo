Glossaire module for XOOPS is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

An attacker can leverage this issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Glossaire 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
