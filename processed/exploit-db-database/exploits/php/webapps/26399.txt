vCard is prone to a remote file include vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary remote PHP code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.
