[Bug Description and Proof of Concept]

1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests
without performing any validity checks to verify the requests. This can be exploited to perform certain actions
with administrative privileges if a logged-in user visits a malicious web site
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery

2. Cross Site Scripting (XSS) - Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were also discovered. The issue is
triggered when input passed via multiple parameters is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting

3. SQL Injection - iScripts EasyCreate suffers from a SQL Injection vulnerability. Input passed via a GET
parameter is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user or used in SQL queries. This can be exploited
to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
