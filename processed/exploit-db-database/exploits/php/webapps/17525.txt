# Version: 1.2.11
# Fixed In: 1.2.12

Versions prior to 1.2.12 suffer from a blind sql injection in the "view"
parameter, depending on Xmap's internal cache settings.

POSTDATA: option=com_xmap&tmpl=component&Itemid=999&view=[SQL]

1.2.12 has been patched. Older versions with cache=off cannot be
exploited in this fashion.
