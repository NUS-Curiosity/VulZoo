# Version: 1.14 <https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2/releases/tag/1.14>
# Payload:  @SUM(1+9)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0

# Proof Of Concept:
CSV Injection (aka Excel Macro Injection or Formula Injection) exists in
creating new timesheet in Kimai. By filling the Description field with malicious
payload, it will be mistreated while exporting to a CSV file.

To exploit this vulnerability:
1- Login as user.
2- Create new timesheet.
3- Fill the description with the malicious payload.
4- Save the timesheet.
5- Export it via CSV.
6- Open the CSV file, allow all popups and our payload is executed(calculator is opened).
