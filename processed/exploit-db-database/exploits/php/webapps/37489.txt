MGB is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

MGB 0.6.9.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
