I. ABOUT THE APPLICATION

EasySnaps is a commercial powerful image hosting site that
will help  you  in hosting your images besides providing a
large number of utilities.


II. DESCRIPTION

Some  fields  are not properly sanitised before being used
in SQL queries.


III. ANALYSIS

Summary:

 A) Blind SQL Injection
 B) SQL Injection


A) Blind SQL Injection

The comment parameter in add_comments.php is not  properly
sanitised before being used in a INSERT type SQL query.


B) SQL Injection

The values parameter in tags_details.php (search form) is
not  properly  sanitised before used in a SQL query. This
can be  exploited  to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
arbitrary SQL code.
Successful exploitation requires  that \\\"magic_quotes_gpc\\\"
is disabled.

There  is  a  SQL  injection  that maybe may be exploited
bypassing  the  internal  filters in the begin parameter.
The affected file is greetings.php.

I tryed to test the upload forms for found arbitrary file
upload  flaws  but I could not do anything because of the
following error: \\\"Your Image Count is full!\\\".


IV. SAMPLE CODE

B) SQL Injection

POST /gallery/demo/tags_details.php HTTP/1.1
Host: site
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Cookie: your_php_sessid
Content-Length: 84

values=%25\\\' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20#&jumb=Go

You can inject the previous code using the search form in
tags_details.php page.


V. FIX

No Fix.
