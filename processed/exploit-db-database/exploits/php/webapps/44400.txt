1. Description:
It is a plugin which adds a page to download files. If enabled, regular members can add new downloads to the page after admin approval.

Persistent XSS
- Go to downloads.php page
- Create a New Download
- Add the following to the title <BODY ONLOAD=alert('XSS')>
- Now when the admin goes to validate your download he will be alerted

Update to the latest release
