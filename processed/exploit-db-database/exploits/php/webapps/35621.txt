4images is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities and an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer in the context of the webserver process or compromise the application, access or modify data, exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database, or bypass the authentication control.

4images 1.7.9 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
