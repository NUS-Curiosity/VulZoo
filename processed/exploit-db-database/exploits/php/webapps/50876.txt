# Vendor Homepage: https://wppopupmaker.com

# Version: <1.16.5
# Tested on: WordPress 5.9 on Ubuntu 20.04


1. Description:
----------------------
WordPress Plugin Popup Maker <1.16.5 does not sanitise and escape some of its popup settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.


2. Proof of Concept:
----------------------
Create Popup > Popup Settings > Triggers > Add New Cookie > Add > Cookie Time  (overwrite the default '1 month' with XSS payload)
Click 'Add' what triggers the XSS payload

Payload examples:

<script>alert('XSS');</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
