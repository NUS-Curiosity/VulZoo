WmsCMS is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input data before rendering it in a user's browser.

Attackers could exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users of the site; other attacks are also possible.

WmsCMS 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
