Version 	: Crafty Syntax Live Help <= 2.14.6
Risk 	: SQL Injection


Description:
Crafty Syntax Live Help is a full featured, open source, online support
system written in php that allows the visitors of a website to interact
in real time with the site owners. There is a couple of high risk SQL Injections
in Crafty Syntax Live Help that allows for an attacker to read arbitrary database
contents such as user credentials, or administrator credentials. An updated version
of Crafty Syntax Live Help is now available and users should upgrade as soon as possible.


SQL Injection
There is a high risk SQL Injection issue within Crafty Syntax Live Help that allows for
an attacker to read arbitrary database contents such as user credentials, or administrator
credentials. The vulnerable bit of code in question can be seen below.

if(empty($UNTRUSTED['department'])){ $department=0; } else { $department=$UNTRUSTED['department']; }

// Get department information. First found if no specific department assigned
$qQry = "SELECT recno,messageemail,colorscheme,leavetxt,creditline,onlineimage,leaveamessage,offlineimage,speaklanguage FROM livehelp_departments "
      . (($department==0)? 'LIMIT 1': "WHERE recno=$department");




The above code can be found in is_xmlhttp.php, but an almost identical issue can
be found within the file is_flush.php also. This SQL Injection issue is present
regardless of magic quotes settings, and can be triggered using a url like the one shown below.

/is_xmlhttp.php?scriptname=1&department=-99%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,concat (username,char(58),password),4,5,6,7,8,9%20FROM%20livehelp_users/*

Since Crafty Syntax Live Help seems to store passwords in plain text by default, it
is a trivial task for an attacker to gain administrative access to the installation
after exploiting this issue.


Solution:
An updated version of Crafty Syntax Live Help has been released and can be found at the location below.
