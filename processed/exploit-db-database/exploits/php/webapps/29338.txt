vBulletin is prone to a vulnerability that may let remote attackers inject arbitrary script code into the application.

If exploited, this vulnerability may let attackers steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

Update: Note that the ability to upload SWF files is disabled by default, and must be enabled by site administrators to expose this issue.

This BID is being retired because further information shows that the application is not vulnerable to this issue.
