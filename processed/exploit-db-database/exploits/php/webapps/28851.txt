Crafty Syntax Live Help is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Note that these issues affect only the version of Crafty Syntax Live Help that includes the Text Based Database Support package (Txt-db-api).

Version 2.9.9 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
