=============================================
Web Server Cache Poisoning in CMS Made Simple
=============================================

CVE-2016-2784

Product Description
===================

CMS Made Simple is a great tool with many plugins to publish content on the Web. It aims to
be simple to use by end users and to provide a secure and robust website.

Website: http://www.cmsmadesimple.org/

Description
===========

A remote unauthenticated attacker can insert malicious content in a CMS Made Simple
installation by poisoning the web server cache when Smarty Cache is activated by modifying
the Host HTTP Header in his request.

The vulnerability can be triggered only if the Host header is not part of the web server
routing process (e.g. if several domains are served by the same web server).

This can lead to phishing attacks because of the modification of the site's links,
defacement or Cross-Site-Scripting attacks by a lack of filtering of HTML entities in
$_SERVER variable.

**Access Vector**: remote
**Security Risk**: medium
**Vulnerability**: CWE-20
**CVSS Base score**: 5.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

----------------
Proof of Concept
----------------

Request that shows improper HTML entities filtering and will insert
' onload='javacript:alert(Xss) in the pages :

  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: ' onload='javascrscript:ipt:alert(Xss)
  Accept: */*
  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
  Connection: close

Request that changes the root domain for all links and allows to redirect to external
websites :

  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.malicious.com
  Accept: */*
  Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
  Connection: close

Solution
========

Use the variable $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] instead of the variable $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']
given that the server name is correctly defined or use an application specific
constant.
