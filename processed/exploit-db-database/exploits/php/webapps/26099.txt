FlatNuke is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to inject html and script code into the Web browser of an unsuspecting victim.The attacker may then steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.
