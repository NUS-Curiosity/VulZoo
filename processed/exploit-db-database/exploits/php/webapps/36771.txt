STHS v2 Web Portal is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

STHS v2 Web Portal 2.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
