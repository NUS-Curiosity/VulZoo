NOCC is a web based email client implemented in PHP4. It includes support for POP3, SMTP and IMAP servers, MIME attachments and multiple languages.

A script injection issue has been reported with the way emails are displayed to users of NOCC webmail. A malicious attacker can include script code in an email and potentially get full access to a victim's mailbox.

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

This will show the victim's session id.
