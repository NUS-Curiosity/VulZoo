GuppY is affected by multiple local file include and information disclosure vulnerabilities.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary server-side script code that resides on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may potentially facilitate unauthorized access.

It should be noted that these issues may also be leveraged to read arbitrary files on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server. An attacker can employ directory traversal sequences and NULL characters to disclose arbitrary files.

GuppY 4.5.9 and prior versions are vulnerable.
