# Background

"DT Register is the Joomla Event Registration component that gives you
functionality beyond what any other event booking solution can offer"
(https://extensions.joomla.org/extension/dt-register)


# Vulnerability

SQL injection in Joomla extension "DT Register" by DTH Development
allows remote unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL
commands via the cat parameter.


# Preconditions

No pre-conditions for authentication or authorization.


# Proof-of-Concept

http://[DOMAIN]/[PATH]/index.php?controller=calendar&format=raw&cat[0]=SQLi&task=events

PoC value (shows out all events / it's possible to see valid eventId values):
cat[0]=6) OR 1-- -


## Using UNION

For reading the data out using UNION it's important to have and to
know one valid eventId (detected in previous step).

In total there are 112 fields in select query, eventId position is no
13. For output is best to use position 112.

Step-by-Step - how to read the data out is available in blog:
