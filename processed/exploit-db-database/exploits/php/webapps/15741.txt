I. DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------
A vulnerability exists in the 'Pointter PHP Micro-Blogging Social Network' authentication system which allows for administrative privileges by crafting two specific cookies with arbitrary values.


II. TESTED VERSION
---------------------------------------
1.8


III. PoC EXPLOIT
---------------------------------------
Using whatever method you prefer, generate 'auser' and 'apass' cookies. The values of each cookie are irrelevant; the mere presence of the cookies provide the administrative privilege.


IV. NOTES
---------------------------------------
* Here's a snippet of the final reply that I received from the vendor:
"Of course, it could be made safer and we know how to do it. But we have designed the softwares so that renaming admin folder gives us less work. As you know, the users should know the security issues as they will run this and not us."


V. SOLUTION
---------------------------------------
* There is no update released at this time. Avoidance of this software is recommended until an updated version is available.
