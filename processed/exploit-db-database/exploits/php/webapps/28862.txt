phpMyConference is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

phpMyConference 8.0.2 is vulnerable to this issue.

Update: Further analysis reveals that this is not actually a vulnerability, so this BID is being retired.
