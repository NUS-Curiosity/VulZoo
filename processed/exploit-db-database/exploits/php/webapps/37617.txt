dirLIST is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities and an arbitrary-file upload vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to upload arbitrary files onto the web server, execute arbitrary local files within the context of the web server, and obtain sensitive information.
