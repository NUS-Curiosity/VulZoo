MySQLDumper is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to execute attacker-supplied script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Version 1.2.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
