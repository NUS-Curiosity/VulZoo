PHP Advanced Transfer Manager can allow remote attackers to gain unauthorized access.

Access to sensitive files containing authentication credentials is not restricted, therefore an attacker can simply issue a GET request to obtain a user's password hash. This information can then allow them to successfully authenticate to the service using a cookie.

PHP Advanced Transfer Manager 1.30 is reported to be vulnerable. Other versions may be affected as well.
