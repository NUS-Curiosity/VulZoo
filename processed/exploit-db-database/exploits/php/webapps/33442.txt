FreePBX is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

FreePBX 2.5.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
