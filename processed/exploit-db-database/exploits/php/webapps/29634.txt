Simple Plantilla PHP is prone to multiple input-validation issues, including a local file-include vulnerability and an arbitrary file-upload vulnerability.

Attackers can exploit the local file-include vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to execute local script code in the context of the application. Attackers can exploit the arbitrary file-upload to execute malicious PHP code in the context of the webserver process.

Exploiting these issues may allow attackers to compromise the application and the underlying system or to access sensitive information; other attacks are also possible.
