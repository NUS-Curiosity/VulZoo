# CVE: CVE-2018-15596

# 1. Description:
# On the forum RSS Syndication page you can generate a URL for example...
# http://localhost/syndication.php?fid=&type=atom1.0&limit=15, the thread titles on
# those generated links aren't sanitized.

# 2. Proof of Concept:

- Make or find a thread of yours on the RSS feed
- Use this payload as the thread title  <a href="//google.com">Cool Thread Title</a>
- View RSS feed with your thread again but with the generated URL and click on your thread
- When the thread is clicked you will be redirected to google.com
