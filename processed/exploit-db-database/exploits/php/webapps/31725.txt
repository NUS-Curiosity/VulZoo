Zen Cart is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and an SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Zen Cart 2008 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
