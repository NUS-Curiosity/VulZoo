Bo-Blog is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database; other attacks are also possible.

Bo-Blog 2.1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
