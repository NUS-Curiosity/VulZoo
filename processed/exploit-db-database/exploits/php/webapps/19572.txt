=====================
Vulnerability Details
=====================

Input data from the form submission is not properly sanitized.

Using blind SQL injection techniques, true statements will result in the rating being updated, while false statements will cause the plugin to hang.

=================
Injection Example
=================

Using Burp Suite or other proxy, intercept the post request when submitting the form and append and 1=1 to the postID parameter before forwarding.

True statement example:

action=cast_vote&token=d9ad983425&moodthingyvote=6&postID=6 and 1=1&results_div_id=voteresults

In the example above, the request will process successfully and the rating will be updated accordingly.

By replacing 1=1 with 1=0, the plugin will hang and the process will never successfully complete, giving you the necessary true/false conditions for blind sql injections.
