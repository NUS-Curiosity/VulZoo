This plugin is based on the default tagging plugin that comes with Vanilla. Therefore this is vulnerable to the same attack.

Create a new thread and post your XSS as tag. I used
<script>alert('xss')</script>

You will have to use a proxy / manipulate the form to bypass the max-length on the form.

Once you have posted the thread, send an administrator or moderator to

http://target.tld/index.php?p=/vanilla/post/editdiscussion/7

Where 7 is the thread ID of the thread you just made. The XSS will then trigger.
You can even use a URL shortener to send the link.

Note: The URL may be different depending on what category your thread is in.
