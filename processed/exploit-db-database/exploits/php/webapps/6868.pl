- SimpleBoard Mambo Component <= 1.0.1 -
- Remote Arbitrary File Upload Exploit -

    Discovered && Coded by: t0pP8uZz
    Discovered on: 20 October 2008
    Vendor has not been notified!

    Note:

        This exploit is a completely diffrent
            method then the prior simpleboard vulns.
            which differs from the one
            located here: http://milw0rm.com/exploits/1994

        Same files vulnerable, But this one works with
            the patch! in later versions of
            SimpleBoard they removed the image_upload.php so
            this wont work. but this
            works on every image_upload.php version. with the
            patch in place!

        A common error for the exploit is if openbase_dir is
            enabled, then this means
            the file will not get uploaded due to the
            dir restrictions.
