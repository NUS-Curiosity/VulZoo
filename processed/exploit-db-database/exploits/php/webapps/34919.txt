SkyBlueCanvas is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue requires administrative privileges and may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

SkyBlueCanvas 1.1 r237 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
