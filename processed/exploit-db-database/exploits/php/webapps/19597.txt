High


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities  are detected in the GuestBook
Scripts PHP 1.5 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged
user account to inject/execute own sql
commands on the affected application dbms without user inter action.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability
results in dbms & application compromise. The vulnerabilities are
located in the guestbook.php or admin.php files
and the bound parameters p, orderType & orderBy. The sql injection
vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without user
inter action & without privileged user account.

Vulnerable File(s):
            [+] guestbook.php
            [+] admin.php


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
            [+] orderType
            [+] p
            [+] orderBy



1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are
detected in the GuestBook Scripts PHP 1.5 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer,
moderator or admin sessions with high required user inter action
or local low privileged user account. The vulnerabilities are located in
the admin.php file with the bound vulnerable search, p &
ordertype parameters. Successful exploitation can result in account
steal, phishing & client-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable File(s):
            [+] admin.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
            [+] search
            [+] p
            [+] orderType


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The SQL Injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers
with and without privileged user account.
User inter action is not required for exploitation. For demonstration or
reproduce ...

http://127.0.0.1:80/cms/guestbook.php?p=[SQL-INJECTION]
http://127.0.0.1:80/cms/guestbook/admin.php?act=comments&orderType=[ASC/DESC]&search=&orderBy=[SQL-INJECTION]
http://127.0.0.1:80/cms/guestbook/admin.php?act=comments&orderType=[SQL-INJECTION]

1.2
The persistent vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers
without privileged user account & with low
required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

http://127.0.0.1:80/cms/guestbook/admin.php?act=comments&orderType=[ASC/DESC]&search=&orderBy=[CROSS
SITE SCrIPTING]
http://127.0.0.1:80/cms/guestbook/admin.php?act=comments&orderType=[ASC/DESC]&search=[CROSS
SITE SCrIPTING]
http://127.0.0.1:80/cms/guestbook/admin.php?act=comments&orderType=[CROSS SITE
SCrIPTING]


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as
high.

1.2
The security risk of the input validation vulnerabilities are estiamted
as low(+)
