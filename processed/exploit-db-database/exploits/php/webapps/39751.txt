Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered a high-risk SQL injection vulnerability in a popular Information Resource Manager (IRM) system GLPI. IRM systems are usually used for management and audit of software packages, providing ITIL-compliant service desk. The vulnerability allows remote non-authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, read and write data to the application's database and completely compromise the vulnerable system.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data passed via the "page_limit" HTTP GET parameter to "/ajax/getDropdownConnect.php" PHP script. A remote unauthenticated attacker can alter present SQL query, inject and execute arbitrary SQL command in application's database.

Below is a simple SQL Injection exploit, which uses time-based exploitation technique. The page will load time will be significantly higher if MySQL version is 5.X or superior:
