It has been reported that Psychoblogger may be prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities that may allow a remote attacker to execute HTML or script code in a user's browser. The issues are reported to exist in the 'imageview.php', 'entryadmin.php', 'authoredit.php', 'blockedit.php', 'configadmin.php' and 'quoteedit.php' scripts. These vulnerabilities result from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data passed via vulnerable parameters.

Psychoblogger version PB-beta1 has been reported to be prone to these issues, however, other versions could be affected as well.
