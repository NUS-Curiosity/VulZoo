It has been reported that VBulletin is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the 'showthread.php' script. This issue is reportedly due to a failure to sanitize user input and so allow for injection of HTML and script code that may facilitate cross-site scripting attacks.

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.
