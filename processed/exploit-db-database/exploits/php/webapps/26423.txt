Mantis is prone to a remote and local file include vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary remote and local PHP code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.

Versions 0.19.2 and 1.0.0rc2 are affected; an upgrade to version 0.19.3 is available.
