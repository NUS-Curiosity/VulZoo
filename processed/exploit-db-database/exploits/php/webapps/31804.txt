Digital Hive is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to view local files in the context of the webserver process. This may aid in further attacks.

Digital Hive 2.0 RC2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
