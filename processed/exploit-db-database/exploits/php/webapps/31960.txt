A+ PHP Scripts News Management System is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including a remote file-include issue, multiple local file-include issues, and a cross-site scripting issue.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to include and execute local and remote scripts in the context of the webserver process. Attackers can also execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.

These issues affect News Management System 0.3; other versions may also be vulnerable.
