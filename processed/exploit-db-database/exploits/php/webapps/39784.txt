[Bug Description and Proof of Concept]

- ZeewaysCMS suffers from a file inclusion vulnerability (LFI) when encoded input passed thru the 'targeturl' GET
parameter is not properly verified before being used to include files. This can be exploited to include files from
local resources with directory traversal attacks and URL encoded NULL bytes.

- Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were also discovered. The issue is triggered when input passed
via multiple parameters is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to
execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
