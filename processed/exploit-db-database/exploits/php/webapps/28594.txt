The 'artmedic links' application is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to have malicious PHP code execute in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

This issue affects version 5.0; other versions may also be vulnerable.
