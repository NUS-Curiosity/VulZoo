eFiction is prone to SQL injection, remote file upload, and cross site scripting vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to view and modify sensitive information, gain unauthorized access, modify and corrupt the underlying database application, and obtain a victim's authentication credentials.

eFiction versions 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 are reported to be vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
