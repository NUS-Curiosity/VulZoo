SMW+ is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code can run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

SMW+ 1.5.6 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
