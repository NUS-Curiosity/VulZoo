AlmondSoft Almond Classifieds is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

AlmondSoft Almond Classifieds Enterprise, Pro, and WAP Editions are vulnerable.
