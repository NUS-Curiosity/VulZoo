Cimy Counter for WordPress is prone to an HTTP response-splitting vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and influence how web content is served, cached, or interpreted. This could aid in various attacks that try to entice client users into a false sense of trust.

Versions prior to Cimy Counter for WordPress 0.9.5 are vulnerable.
