Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
SeedDMS is a free document management system with an easy to use web
based user interface. It is based on PHP and
MySQL or sqlite3 and runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows. Many years of
development has made it a mature, powerful
and enterprise ready platform for sharing and storing documents. It's
fully compatible with its predecessor LetoDMS.

Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple persistent cross site web vulnerabilities has been discovered
in the SeedDMS v4.3.37, v5.0.13, v5.1.14 and v6.0.7 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector to compromise browser to
web-application requests from the application-side.

The persistent cross site scripting web vulnerabilities are located in
the `name` and `comment` parameter of the `AddEvent.php` file.
Remote attackers are able to add an own event via op.AddEvent with
malicious script codes. The request method to inject is POST
and the attack vector is located on the application-side. After the
inject the execution occurs in the admin panel within the
`Log Management` - `Webdav` and `Web` on view. The content of the
comment and name is unescaped pushed inside of the logs with
a html/js template. Thus allows an attacker to remotly exploit the issue
by a simple post inject from outside with lower privileges.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects
to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected
application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] op.AddEvent (AddEvent.php)

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] name
[+] comment

Affected Module(s):
[+] Log Management (out.LogManagement.php)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers
with low privileged web-application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security web
vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Start your local webbrowser and tamper the http protocol session
2. Open the AddEvent.php and add a new event
3. Insert your script code test payload inside the Name or Comments path
4. Save or submit the entry with error
Note: Now the web and webdav log has captured the insert or erro
5. Now wait until the administrator previews in the log management the
web or webdav view function
6. Successful reproduce of the persistent web vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1. Parse and escape the name and comment input field on transmit to sanitize
2. Filter and restrict the input field of the name and comments
parameter for special chars to prevent injects
3. Parse the output location of all web and webdav logfiles to prevent
the execution point


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent cross site web vulnerabilities in
the seeddms web-application are estimated as medium.
