Multiple input validation vulnerabilities reportedly affect Invision Community Blog. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to using it to carry out critical actions.

The first issue is a cross-site scripting issue and the second set of issues are SQL injection issues.

An attacker may leverage these issues to carry out cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks against the affected application. This may result in the theft of authentication credentials, destruction or disclosure of sensitive data, and potentially other attacks.
