WordPress FCChat Widget plugin is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers upload arbitrary files. The issue occurs because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to upload arbitrary files to the affected computer; this can result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable application.

WordPress FCChat Widget plugin 2.2.12.2 through versions 2.2.13.1 are vulnerable.
