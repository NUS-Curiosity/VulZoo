Simple OS CMS is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data.

Simple OS CMS 0.1c beta is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following exploit information is available:

Passing:

username: admin' or 1=1/*
password: something


will bypass the authentication process.
