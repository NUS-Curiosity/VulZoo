Multiple Webify products are prone to multiple HTML-injection and local file-include vulnerabilities because they fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the context of the affected browser, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and execute arbitrary local scripts in the context of the web server process. Other attacks are also possible.

The following Webify products are vulnerable:

Webify eDownloads Cart
Webify eDownloads
Webify Project Manager
Webify Blog

Local file include:
