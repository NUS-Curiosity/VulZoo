PHP-Ultimate Webboard is prone multiple-input validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits will allow unauthorized attackers to delete arbitrary questions and answers. Attackers may also exploit these issues to perform SQL-injection attacks.

PHP-Ultimate Webboard 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
