p.mapper is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

These issues affect p.mapper 3.2.0 beta3; other versions may also be vulnerable.
