Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered two vulnerabilities in Achievo, which can be exploited to perform SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) SQL Injection vulnerability in Achievo: CVE-2012-5865

The vulnerability was discovered in the "dispatch.php" script while handling the "activityid" HTTP GET parameter. A remote authenticated attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that an attacker is logged-in into application (registration is closed by default).

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) code outputs version of the MySQL server:

http://[host]/dispatch.php?atknodetype=project.activity&atkaction=stats&activityid=0%20UNION%20SELECT%201,version%28%29,3,4
Registration is closed by default.


2) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Achievo: CVE-2012-5866

Input sanitation error was found in the "include.php" script when handling the "field" HTTP GET parameter. A remote attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of a vulnerable website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) outputs user's cookie:
http://[host]/include.php?file=atk/popups/colorpicker.inc&field=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
