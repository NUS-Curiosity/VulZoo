Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Horizon QCMS, which can be exploited to read contents of arbitrary files and perform SQL Injection attacks.


1) Path Traversal in Horizon QCMS: CVE-2013-7138

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of "start" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/lib/functions/d-load.php" script before using it in PHP "fopen()" function. A remote attacker can read contents of arbitrary files on the target system with privileges of the web server.

The exploitation example below will display content of "/config.php" file that contains MySQL database login credentials:

http://[host]/lib/functions/d-load.php?start=../../config.php


2) SQL Injection in Horizon QCMS: CVE-2013-7139

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of "category" HTTP POST parameter passed to "/download.php" script. A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database.

The exploitation example below displays version of MySQL server:

http://[host]/download.php?category=%27%20union%20select%201,2,version(),4,5,6%20--%202
