-- Description --

The stored XSS vulnerability allows any authenticated user to inject malicious code via the name of the uploaded file:

Example: <svg onload=alert(0)>.jpg

The vulnerability exists because the file name is not properly sanitized
and this can lead to malicious code injection that will be executed on the
targetâ€™s browser.

-- Proof of Concept --


1. The attacker creates a new download package via the plugin's menu
and uploads a file with the name: <svg onload=alert(0)>.jpg

2. The stored XSS can be triggered when an authenticated user (e.g. admin)
attempts to edit this download package
