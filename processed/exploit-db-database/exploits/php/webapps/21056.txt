| Group-Office Calendar SQL Injection |
\-------------------------------------/


Summary
=======

Versions of Group-Office (a web app for online collaboration) prior to
4.0.90 are subject to a SQL injection vulnerability located in the calendar
module. A PHP file, used to serve data in the JSON format, does not
sufficiently sanitise a user-supplied parameter injected into the ORDER BY
part of an SQL query. An attacker can leverage this flaw to extract
information from the database via SQL errors.

CVE number: CVE-2012-4240

Affected Products
======== ========

Confirmed in Group-Office community 4.0.71, 4.0.73 and 4.0.88. Other
versions may also be affected.


Details
=======

A 'sort' parameter on the page /modules/calendar/json.php was found to be
subject to a SQL injection vulnerability. It was possible to inject
arbitrary SQL statements into an ORDER BY clause, retrieving information
from the database via an error message. The attacker must be authenticated
as a valid user in order for the attack to be successful.

Injecting the following SQL code into the 'sort' parameter will trigger the
vulnerability, retrieving the first user's username. Changing 'username' to
'password' retrieves their hashed password. For version 4.0.71:

ExtractValue(1,CONCAT(0x5c,(SELECT username FROM go_users LIMIT 1)))

Or for versions 4.0.73 and 4.0.88:

id`,ExtractValue(1,CONCAT(0x5c,(SELECT username FROM go_users LIMIT 1)))#

Impact
======

An authenticated attacker might be able to take control of the database
within the context of the MySQL user, and potentially use this as leverage
to further compromise the host machine.


Solution
========

Upgrade to Group-Office community 4.0.90.
