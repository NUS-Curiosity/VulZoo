# Description:

Error Log Viewer is a simple utility plugin that helps to find and view log files with errors right from the WordPress admin dashboard. Get access to all log files from one place. View the latest activity, select logs by date, view a full log file or clear a log file!

I've especially emphasized "clearing a log file" statement because the feature of "clearing a log file" can be used to delete an arbitrary file in a Wordpress web site. The reason of the vulnerability is that, the value of a file path which is going to be deleted is not properly and sufficiently controlled. Name of the parameter leading to the vulnerability is "rrrlgvwr_clear_file_name". It can be manipulated only authenticated users.

An attacker can use this vulnerability; to destroy the web site by deleting wp-config.php file, or to cover the fingerprints by clearing related log files.

# Steps To Reproduce

1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. Click the "Log Monitor" available under Error Log Viewer menu item.
3. Choose a log file to clear.
4. Intercept the request via Burp or any other local proxy tool.
5. Replace the value of the parameter "rrrlgvwr_clear_file_name" with a file path which is going to be cleared, such as /var/www/html/wp-config.php.
6. Check the content of the cleared file. You will see that the file is empty.
