Script: Kayako eSupport <= 2.3.1
Vendor: Kayako (www.kayako.com)
Discovered: beford <xbefordx gmail com>
Comments: It seems like the vendor silently fixed the issue in the
current version (more like since v2.3.5) withouth warning users of
previous versions, noobs. Requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
