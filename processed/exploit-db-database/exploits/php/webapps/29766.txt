w-Agora is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including possible SQL-injection issues and multiple cross-site scripting issues, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

w-Agora 4.2.1 is vulnerable.
