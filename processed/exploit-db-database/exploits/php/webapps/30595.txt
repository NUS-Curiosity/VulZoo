Coppermine Photo Gallery is prone to a cross-site scripting issue and a local file-include issue.

Attackers can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, execute arbitrary code, and retrieve arbitrary content within the context of the webserver process.

Coppermine Photo Gallery 1.4.12 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
