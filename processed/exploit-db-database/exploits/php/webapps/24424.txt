DasBlog is reportedly susceptible to an HTML injection vulnerability in its request log. This vulnerability is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input data before using it in the generation of dynamic web pages.

This may allow an attacker to inject malicious HTML and script code into the application. An administrator displaying the 'Activity and Events Viewer' will have the attacker-supplied script code executed within their browser in the context of the vulnerable site. This issue may be leverage to steal cookie based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

Although this issue reportedly affects versions 1.3 through 1.6 of the affected software.
