D3Jeeb is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
