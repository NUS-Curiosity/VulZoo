nePHP is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.

This vulnerability will allow a malicious user to perform attacks on an unsuspecting user in the context of the site hosting the affected application.

This can lead to the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, as well as other attacks.
