ATutor 2.0.2 Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities (SQLi/XSS/PD)


Vendor: ATutor (Inclusive Design Institute)
Product web page: http://www.atutor.ca
Affected version: 2.0.2 (build r10589)

Summary: ATutor is an Open Source Web-based Learning Content Management
System (LCMS) designed with accessibility and adaptability in mind.
Educators can quickly assemble, package, and redistribute Web-based
instructional content, easily retrieve and import prepackaged content,
and conduct their courses online.


Desc: ATutor suffers from sql injection, cross-site scripting and path
disclosure vulnerabilities.

The XSS issue is triggered when input passed via the 'search_friends_HASH'
POST parameter, where HASH is the value generated by the 'rand_key' parameter,
to the '/mods/_standard/social/index_public.php' script is not properly
sanitised before being returned to the user.

The PD issues can be triggered by the cookie variable 'ATutorID' when setting random
value or none in various scripts.

The SQLi issue can be triggered by 'p_course', 'name' and 'value' parameters in
'/mods/_standard/social/set_prefs.php' script.

Theese issues can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
user's browser session in context of an affected site, displaying the full
installation path in an error report and to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
arbitrary SQL code.
