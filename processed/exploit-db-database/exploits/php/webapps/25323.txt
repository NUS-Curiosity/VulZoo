MX Shop is reportedly affected by an SQL-injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

This vulnerability could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in modification of query logic.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of security properties of the application. The impact of this issue depends on the underlying database that is being used.

InterAKT Online MX Shop version 1.1.1 is reported prone to these issues; other versions might also be affected.
