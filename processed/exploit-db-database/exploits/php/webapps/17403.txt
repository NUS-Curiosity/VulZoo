Vulnerability Details:
High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Free Simple CMS , which can be exploited to perform cross-site scripting attacks.

1) Input appended to the URL after index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/index.php/%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C
/script%3E

2) Input passed via the GET "db_themes_background_color_page" parameter to /themes/default/index.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of affected website.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/themes/default/index.php?db_themes_background_color_page=%
22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28123%29;%3C/script%3E

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

3) Input passed via the GET "include" parameter to index.php (when GET "page" parameter is set to "login" and GET "request" parameter is set to "forgot_password") is not properly verified before being used to include files.
This can be exploited to include arbitrary files from local resources via directory traversal sequences.

The following PoC code is available:

http://[host]/index.php?page=login&request=forgot_password&include=../..
/../../../../../../etc/passwd
