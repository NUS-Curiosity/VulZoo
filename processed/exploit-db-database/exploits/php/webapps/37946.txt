The Crayon Syntax Highlighter plug-in for WordPress is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information or to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web server process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying computer; other attacks are also possible.

Crayon Syntax Highlighter 1.12.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
