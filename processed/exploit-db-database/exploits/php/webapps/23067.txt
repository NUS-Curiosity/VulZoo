It has been reported that eNdonesia is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to execute HTML or script code in a victim's browser. The issue reportedly exists in the mod.php script via the 'mod' URI parameter.

Successful exploitation may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based credentials from a user. Other attacks are possible as well.
