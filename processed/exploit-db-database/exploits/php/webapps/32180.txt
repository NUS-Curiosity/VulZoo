The Contact module for Chupix CMS is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues using directory-traversal strings to view local files within the context of the webserver process. Information harvested may aid in further attacks.

Contact 0.1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
