HolaCMS is prone to a vulnerability that may allow remote users to corrupt files on the server.

This issue is similar to the vulnerability described in BID 12789 (HolaCMS Voting Module Remote File Corruption Vulnerability). It is reported that HolaCMS 1.4.9-1, which was released to address the issue in BID 12789 is still vulnerable to a variant of that issue.

Specifically, an attacker can bypass the fix introduced in HolaCMS 1.4.9-1 by including directory traversal sequences in the path to a target file.

HolaCMS 1.4.9-1 and prior versions are affected by this issue.
