Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered  in
the Buddypress v6.0.0 - v6.2.0 plugin for wordpress.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector to compromise
browser to web-application requests from the application-side.

The persistent vulnerability is located in the `wp:html` name parameter
of the `figure` content. Remote attackers with privileges
are able to inject own malicious persistent script code as input to
compromise the internal ui of the wordpress backend. The attacker
injects his code and in case the admin or other privileged user account
previews the content the code simple executes. The request method
to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on the application-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external
redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected
application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] wp:html

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] figure

Affected Module(s):
[+] page_id=x&preview=true


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers
with privilged user accounts without user interaction.
