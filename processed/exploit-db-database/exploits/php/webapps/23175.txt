It has been reported that yMonda Thread-IT is prone to a HTML injection vulnerability that may allow an attacker to execute HTML code in a user's browser. The issue is reported to be present in the 'Topic Title', 'Name', and 'Message' fields. This problem is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

Thread-IT version 1.6 and prior may be vulnerable to this issue.
