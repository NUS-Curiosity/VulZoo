Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in ITtechScripts Swoopo Gold Shop CMS v8.4.56.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-05-14:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
ITechScripts
Product: Swoopo Gold Shop CMS v8.4.56


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in ITtechScripts Swoopo Gold Shop CMS v8.4.56.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
The vulnerability is located on the username post method.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] EX_DATE - ID


1.2
A blind SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in ITtechScripts Swoopo Gold Shop CMS v8.4.56.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
The vulnerability is located on the itechd.php file in the product id value.

Vulnerable Module(s):
 				[+] itechd - Product ID



2.1
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in ITtechScripts Swoopo Gold Shop CMS v8.4.56.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent)
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action because the admin needs to watch the user list.
The user includes his scriptcode as profile name and the code is getting executed on the administrator section
persistent.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Contact Form - TEXT NAME
				[+] TellaFreind - E-Mail ID


2.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in ITtechScripts Swoopo Gold Shop CMS v8.4.56.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing
& client-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] All_Live
				[+] List_Type
				[+] User_Reg - TxTcity
				[+] reviewitechds - Product ID


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The sql inejction vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.2
The blind sql inejction vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

2.2
The non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium
or high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Note: URL encoded GET via input cats_id.

PoC:
all_live.php?cats_id=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&list_type=0
all_live.php?cats_id=14&list_type=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
reviewitechds.php?productid=%<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>&recycle=yes

POST (multipart) input txtcity  set  " onmouseover=prompt(1337)=">
The input is getting reflected executed out of the tag element


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the remote sql injection vulnerability is estimated as critical.

1.2
The security risk of the blind sql injection vulnerability is estimated as critical.

2.1
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).

2.2
The security risk of the non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as low(+).
