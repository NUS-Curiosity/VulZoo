Download Management for PHP-Fusion is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to access potentially sensitive information and execute arbitrary local scripts in the context of the affected application.

These issues affect Download Management 1.00; other versions may also be vulnerable.
