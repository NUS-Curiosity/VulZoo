WHMCS is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and multiple HTML-parameter-pollution vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the page is rendered to the user, and override existing hard-coded HTTP parameters which compromises the application.

WHMCS 5.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
