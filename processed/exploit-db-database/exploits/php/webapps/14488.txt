I. ABOUT THE APPLICATION
________________________

Appointinator is a small and convenient component,  that
allows  you  to   start   appointment   polls  for  your
registered users.


II. DESCRIPTION
_______________

Some parameters  are not properly sanitised before being
used in SQL queries.  These  bugs  can be exploited from
registered users.


III. ANALYSIS
_____________

Summary:

 A) SQL Injection
 B) Blind SQL Injection


A) SQL Injection
________________

The parameter  aid passed to app.php when view is set to
App is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL
query.  This can  be exploited to manipulate SQL queries
by injecting arbitrary SQL code.


B) Blind SQL Injection
______________________

The parameter aid passed to app.php via POST in the vote
form  is  not  properly sanitised before being used in a
SQL query by the store function. This can  be  exploited
to  manipulate  SQL  queries  by injecting arbitrary SQL
code.


IV. SAMPLE CODE
