427BB is reportedly affected by multiple remote HTML injection vulnerabilities. These issues occur because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

The attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be able to access properties of the site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

These issues are reported to affect all versions of 427BB.
