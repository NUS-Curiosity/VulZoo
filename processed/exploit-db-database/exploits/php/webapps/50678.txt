Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple reflected cross site scripting web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the Affiliate Pro - Affiliate Management System v1.7.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with non-persistent attack vector to compromise client-site
browser to web-application requests.

The non-persistent cross site scripting web vulnerabilities are located in the `email`,`username` and `fullname` parameters of the `index` module.
Attackers are able to inject own malicious script code to the `Fullname`,`Username` or `Email` input fields to manipulate client-side requests.
The request method to inject is post and the attack vector is non-persistent (reflected) on client-side. The injection- and execution points are
located in the index formular for affiliates to enter.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external redirects to
malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] index

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Email
[+] Username
[+] Fullname

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] email
[+] username
[+] fullname


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without account and with low or medium user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the cross site scripting web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.
