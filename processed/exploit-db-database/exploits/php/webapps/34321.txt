Spitfire is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability.

An attacker may exploit these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, perform unauthorized actions, and disclose or modify sensitive information. Other attacks may also be possible.

Spitfire 1.0.381 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
