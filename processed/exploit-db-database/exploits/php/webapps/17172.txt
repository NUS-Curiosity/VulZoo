Details.
A vulnerability has been discovered in the Collaborative Passwords Manager
(cPassMan) web application that can be exploited to retrieve files from the
local host file system. The input passed to the component
"sources/downloadfile.php" via the "path" variable allows the retrieval of
any
file on the local file system that the web server has access to. There is no
data validation or authorisation mechanisms present within this component.

Proof of Concept.
http://localhost/cpassman/sources/downloadfile.php?path=/etc/passwd

Solution.
The author (Nils Laumaille) has indicated that the v1.x branch of cPassMan
will no longer be updated, as he has rewritten the application and v2.0 is
now
the recommended release.
