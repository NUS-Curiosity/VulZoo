dotproject is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the software.

This may be accomplished by submitting a maliciously crafted 'user_cookie' value either manually or via manipulation of URI parameters.

This problem is due to the software relying on the user 'cookie_value' to authenticate the user.

curl -b user_cookie=1 http://server/project/index.php?m=projects

or

http://server/project/index.php?m=projects&user_cookie=1
