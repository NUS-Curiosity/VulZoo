PaNews is reported prone to a remote PHP script code execution vulnerability. It is reported that PHP script code may be injected into the PaNews software through the 'showcopy' parameter of the 'admin_setup.php' script.

Reports indicate that when malicious script code is injected, this code can then be forced to execute in the context of the web service that is hosting the affected software.

This vulnerability is reported to affect PaNews version 2.0b4, other versions might also be affected.
