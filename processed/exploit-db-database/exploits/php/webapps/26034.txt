NETonE PHPBook is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'admin' parameter of the 'guestbook.php' script.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
