TagGator is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Update Apr 9, 2012: The vendor disputes this issue stating the issue can not be exploited as described, as the reported parameter does not exist.
