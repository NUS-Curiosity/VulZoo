TinyPHPForum is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability. This issue arises when a script allows a remote untrusted source to change a victim user's email address, and have their login credentials returned to an attacker.

Information that the attacker gathers by exploiting this vulnerability may aid in other attacks.
