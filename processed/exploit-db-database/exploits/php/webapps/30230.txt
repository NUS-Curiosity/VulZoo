MyNews is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

This issue affects MyNews 0.10; other versions may also be vulnerable.

To exploit this issue, modify the following cookie variable: authacc = "' OR `row_id`=1 UNION SELECT * FROM `sessions` WHERE '1%3A1%3A1%3A1%3AAdmin"
