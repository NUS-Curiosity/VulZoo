Bitweaver is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. These issues include multiple HTML-injection issues and multiple SQL-injection issues.

A successful exploit of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or even exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Other attacks are also possible.

Bitweaver 1.3.1 and prior versions are vulnerable to these issues.
