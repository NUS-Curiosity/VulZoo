Powie PForum is web forum software, written in PHP and back-ended by MySQL. It will run on most Unix and Linux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.

PForum is prone to cross-site scripting attacks. It is possible for an attacker to construct a malicious link which includes arbitrary script code. In particular, the username URL parameter does not filter variations of HTML tags. A legitimate user who browses the malicious link will have the attacker-supplied script code executed in their browser, in their context of the website running the vulnerable software.

This may enable an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from the legitimate user.
