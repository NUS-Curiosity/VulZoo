Mambo Site Server is a freely available, open source web content management tool. It is written in PHP, and available for Unix, Linux, and Microsoft Windows operating systems.

It has been reported that Mambo enables a script by default that may reveal sensitive information. The phpinfo.php script is packaged with Mambo, and installed by default in the administrator subdirectory. A remote user may use this script to gain information about the server, including path and environment information.
