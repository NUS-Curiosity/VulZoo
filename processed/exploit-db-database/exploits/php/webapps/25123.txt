TrackerCam is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities, including buffer-overflow issues, a directory-traversal issue, an information-disclosure issue, an HTML-injection issue, and denial-of-service issues.

A remote attacker could exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code, obtain potentially sensitive information, launch phishing attacks or steal cookie based authentication credentials, and deny service to legitimate users.
