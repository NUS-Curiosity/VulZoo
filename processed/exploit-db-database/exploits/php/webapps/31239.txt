Google Hack Honeypot File Upload Manager is prone to an unauthorized file-access vulnerability. This issue occurs because the application fails to validate users before processing a certain HTTP request.

Attackers can exploit this issue to delete all files that have been uploaded to the application.

File Upload Manager 1.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
