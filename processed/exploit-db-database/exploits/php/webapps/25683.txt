Help Center Live is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Reportedly the application is affected by multiple HTML injection vulnerabilities. Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be able to access properties of the site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

The application is also affected by multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

These issues have reportedly been addressed in the latest release of Help Center Live, this information has not been confirmed by Symantec or the vendor.
