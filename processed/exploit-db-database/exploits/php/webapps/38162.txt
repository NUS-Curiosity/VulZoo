osTicket is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities including:

1. Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
2. An open-redirection vulnerability
3. Multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities

An attacker may leverage these issues to perform spoofing and phishing attacks, to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database and execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.

osTicket 1.7 DPR3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
