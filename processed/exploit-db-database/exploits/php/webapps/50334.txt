Description:

The Library System 1.0 application from Yahoobaba is vulnerable to
SQL injection via the 'student_id' parameter on the student.php page.

==================== 1. SQLi ====================

http://localhost:8081/library-system/student.php

The "student_id" parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection, it was also tested, and an authenticated
user has the full ability to run system commands via --os-shell and fully compromise the system

POST parameter 'student_id' is vulnerable.

step 1 : Navigate to the "Reg student >> View" & capture the request in the proxy tool.
step 2 : Now copy the post request and save it as test.txt file.
step 3 : Run the sqlmap command "sqlmap -r test.txt -p student_id --os-shell"
