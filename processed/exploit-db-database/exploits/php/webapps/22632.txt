XMB Forum has been reported prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

XMB Forum fails to adequately filter script code from URL parameters, making it prone to cross-site scripting attacks. Attacker-supplied script code may be included in a malicious link to a specific XMB Forum script.

This may enable a remote attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users of a host running XMB Forum.

Note that although this vulnerability has been reported to affect XMB Forum 1.8, previous versions might also be affected.
