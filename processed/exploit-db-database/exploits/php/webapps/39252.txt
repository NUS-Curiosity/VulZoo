WP Rss Poster plugin for WordPress is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

WP Rss Poster 1.0.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
