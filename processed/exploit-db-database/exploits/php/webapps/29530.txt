FD Script is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the webserver process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks.

FD Script 1.32 and prior versions are vulnerable to this issue.
