PHPX is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, execute arbitrary script code in the context of the webserver process, compromise the application, obtain sensitive information, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
