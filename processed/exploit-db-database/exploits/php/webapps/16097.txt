====================================================
Zikula CMS 1.2.4 <= Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability
====================================================


1. OVERVIEW

The Zikula 1.2.4 and lower versions were vulnerable to Cross Site
Request Forgery (CSRF).


2. BACKGROUND

Zikula is a Web Application Toolkit, which allows you to run
impressive websites and build powerful online applications. Zikula has
received praise for many things, but we belive the highlights are ease
of use, quick and easy development, security and performance and
lastly flexibility.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Zikula CMS 1.2.4 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a
remote Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack. The flaw
exists because the application does not require multiple steps or
explicit confirmation for sensitive transactions for majority of
administrator functions such as adding new user, assigning user to
administrative privilege. By using a crafted URL, an attacker may
trick the victim into visiting to his web page to take advantage of
the trust relationship between the authenticated victim and the
application. Such an attack could trick the victim into executing
arbitrary commands in the context of their session with the
application, without further prompting or verification.


4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

1.2.4 <=


5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

The following request escalates a normal user to an administrator.

[REQUEST]
POST /zikula/index.php?module=users&type=admin&func=processusers&op=edit
