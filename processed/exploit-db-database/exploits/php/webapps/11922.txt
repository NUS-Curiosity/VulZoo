:: SQL Injection vulnerability
Devana is an open source browser game in which the player can choose between one of three factions and build an empire. Without being logged in, you have the possibility to view the profiles of other players, file: profile_view.php.
Sadly Devana doesn't check the input so SQL injection is possible.
There are currently seven other browser games being listed on sourceforge.net which are based on Devana. It is possible that they suffer from the same vulnerability.
