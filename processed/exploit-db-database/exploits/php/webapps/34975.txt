The SEO Tools plugin for WordPress is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue can allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

SEO Tools 3.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
