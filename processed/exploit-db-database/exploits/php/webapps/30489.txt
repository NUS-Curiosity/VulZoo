Openads (formerly known as phpAdsNew) is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Openads 2.0.11 and prior versions are vulnerable.
