Umapresence is prone to a local file-include vulnerability and an arbitrary file-deletion vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit a local file-include vulnerability to obtain potentially sensitive information and execute arbitrary local scripts in the context of the web server process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

Attackers can exploit an arbitrary file-deletion vulnerability with directory-traversal strings ('../') to delete arbitrary files; this may aid in launching further attacks.

Umapresence 2.6.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
