[+] ISR: ApparitionSec



Vendor:
==================
www.trendmicro.com



Product:
===========
OfficeScan
v11.0 and XG (12.0)*


Vulnerability Type:
===================
Unauthorized NT Domain Disclosure
Unauthorized PHP Information Disclosure

OfficeScan protects enterprise networks from malware, network viruses, web-based threats, spyware, and mixed threat attacks.
An integrated solution, OfficeScan consists of the OfficeScan agent program that resides at the endpoint and a server program that
manages all agents. The OfficeScan agent guards the endpoint and reports its security status to the server. The server, through the
web-based management console, makes it easy to set coordinated security policies and deploy updates to every agent.



CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-14085



Security Issue(s):
================
( NT Domain Disclosure )
Remote unauthenticated attackers who reach the TrendMicro OfficeScan XG application can query the networks NT domains.
NT enumeration is leaked by the web interface when it should not do so. Usually, you use NET commands so while this NT enumeration
is not high in severity, it should not return this information and especially to unauthorized users as it can aid in launching
further attacks.


( PHP Information Disclosure )
Remote unauthenticated attackers that can connect to TrendMicro OfficeScan XG application can query the PHP version and modules.

In 'analyzeWF.php" we see get_loaded_extensions() and phpversion() calls, but session or authentication check is made.

$strAnalyzeResultHeader .= analyzeWFShowItemInfo('Current PHP version: '.phpversion());
$strAnalyzeResultHeader .= analyzeWFShowItemInfo('PHP extensions: '.implode(', ',get_loaded_extensions()));
$strAnalyzeResultHeader .= analyzeWFShowItemInfo('WGF version : '.$strVersion);

etc...
