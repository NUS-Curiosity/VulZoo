Quick.Cart and Quick.CMS are prone to a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability because the applications allow users to bypass certain security checks.

Exploiting this issue may allow a remote attacker to perform certain administrative actions, gain unauthorized access to an affected application, or delete certain data. Other attacks are also possible.

Quick.Cart 3.4 and Quick.CMS 2.4 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

NOTE: The vendor refutes this issue stating the issue can not be replicated as described.
