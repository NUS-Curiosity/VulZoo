HLstats is prone to mulitiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may help an attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

HLstats 1.35 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
