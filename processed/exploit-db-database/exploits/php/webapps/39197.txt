Search Everything plugin for WordPress is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Versions prior to Booking System (Booking Calendar) 1.3 are vulnerable.
