Dotproject is prone to the following security vulnerabilities:

1. Multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities

2. Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Dotproject versions prior to 2.1.7 are vulnerable.
