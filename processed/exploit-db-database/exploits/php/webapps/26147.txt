MyBulletinBoard is prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerability. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Reports indicate an attacker can exploit at least one of these vulnerabilities to gain administrative access to the affected application.

The following proof of concept demonstrates the vulnerability in admin/index.php:
Username: ' or 1=1 /*
Password: blank
