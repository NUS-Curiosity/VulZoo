Abstract:
=========
Vulnerability-Lab Team (Chokri B.A.) discovered Multiple Web Vulnerabilities on the resource management tool Achievo v1.4.3.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-01-30:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple persistant cross site & a blind SQL vulnerabilities are detected on the resource management tool Achievo v1.4.3.
The bug allows remote attacker to implement malicious script code on the application side and/or to execute sql commands via
remote sql injection attack..
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate specific modules & can
lead to session hijacking (user/mod/admin) and/or to compromise the application & dbms.


Vulnerable Module(s):
							[+] Users preferences
							[+] Projects
							[+] Download vcard ( SQLi )

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persistant xss vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).

1.2
The security risk of the blind sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as high(+).
