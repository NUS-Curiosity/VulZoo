Havalite CMS is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Havalite CMS 1.1.7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
