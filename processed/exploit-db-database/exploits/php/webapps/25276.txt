phpMyDirectory is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

The problem presents itself when malicious HTML and script code is sent to the application through various parameters of the 'review.php' script.

This issue may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

phpMyDirectory 10.1.3-rel is reported vulnerable, however, it is possible that other versions are affected as well.
