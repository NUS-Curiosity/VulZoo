Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in Manage Engines Mobile Application Manager v10.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-06-23:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Manage Engine
Product: Mobile Application Manager v10.0


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities  are detected  in Manage Engines Mobile Application Manager v10.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms without user inter action. The vulnerabilities are located in the DetailsView.do or Search.do
module(s) and the bound vulnerable parameters showMGDetails&groupId & viewName. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities
result in dbms & application compromise via sql injection attack.

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] DetailsView.do
			[+] Search.do

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] showMGDetails&groupId
			[+] viewName


Proof of Concept:
=================
The sql injection vulnerabilities in the mobile manager application can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action.
