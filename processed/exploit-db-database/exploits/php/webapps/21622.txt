PHP-Wiki does not sufficiently sanitize HTML from URI parameters, making it prone to cross-site scripting attacks. An attacker may exploit this condition by enticing users to visit a malicious link which contains attacker-supplied script code.

PHP-Wiki may be used as a module for other software such as PostNuke.
