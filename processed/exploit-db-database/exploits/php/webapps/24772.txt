It is reported that Zwiki is susceptible to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI input prior to including it in dynamic web page content.

This issue could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link that includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were to be followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user.
