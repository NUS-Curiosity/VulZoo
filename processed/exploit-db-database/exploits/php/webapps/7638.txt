After registered and logged in, a user can upload any type of file in "My Picture Album" where a picture would usually be uploaded.
For example, if the file "shell.php" was uploaded to somesite.com, its location would likely be

http://somesite.com/uploads/pictures/pictures/[user]/[picture number]_shell.php

The location of the file can also easily be found by using your browser's "view image" function where the image would appear regularly.
