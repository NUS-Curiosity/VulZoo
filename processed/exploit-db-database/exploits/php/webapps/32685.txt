ViArt Shop is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities:

- Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
- An information-disclosure vulnerability
- An authentication-bypass vulnerability

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary script code, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, obtain sensitive information, or gain unauthorized access to the affected application.

ViArt Shop 3.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
