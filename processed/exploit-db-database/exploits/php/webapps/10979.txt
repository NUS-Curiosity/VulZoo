technical information
---------------------
We can find this obviously flawed code in /scripts_ralcr/filesystem/writeToFile.php:

*************************
$file = "../../".$_POST["path"];

$fh = fopen ($file, 'w') or die("error::Can't open file for writing");
echo fwrite ($fh, stripslashes($_POST["raw_data"]));

fclose($fh);
*************************

An attack can be easily performed by manipulating the parameters (path and raw_data).
Probably other php files in scripts_ralcr are coded without any care about security.
In Oziogallery the vulnerable files are located in /components/com_oziogallery2/imagin/scripts_ralcr/.
