Date published: 2009-10-13
Vendors contacted: Achievo
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: SQL Injection
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2009-2734


3. *Software Description*

4. *Vulnerability Description*

SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a security
vulnerability occurring in the database layer of an application. The
vulnerability is present when user input is either incorrectly filtered for
string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input
is not strongly typed and thereby unexpectedly executed.

For additional information, please look at the references [1] and [2].


5. *Vulnerable packages*

Version <= 1.3.4


6. *Non-vulnerable packages*

Achievo developers informed us that all users should upgrade to the latest
version of Achievo, which fixes this vulnerability. More information to be

7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered by Ryan Dewhurst ( ryan -at- bonsai-sec.com ).


8. *Technical Description*

A SQL injection vulnerability was found in the dispatch.php script, more
specifically in the $user_id variable. The vulnerability can be triggered by
logging into Achievo and browsing to:

/dispatch.php?atknodetype=reports.weekreport&atkaction=report&nameswitch=name&userid=%27&functionlevelswitch=all&startdate[day]=6&startdate[month]=7&startdate[year]=2009&enddate[day]=17&enddate[month]=7&enddate[year]=2009&showstatus=all&outputType=0&atkorderby=period

Which will generate a syntax error in the database. The following is
the corresponding piece of code:

classweekreport.inc:128-134
function get_employee($user_id)
{
    $db = &atkGetDb();
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM person WHERE status='active' AND id='$user_id'";
    $record = $db->getrows($sql);
    return $record[0];
}
