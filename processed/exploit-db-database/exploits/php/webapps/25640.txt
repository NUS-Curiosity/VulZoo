PwsPHP is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

The vendor has addressed this issue in PwsPHP version 1.2.3; earlier versions are reported vulnerable.
