A vulnerability has been discovered in the PHP-Nuke Web Mail module. When a user opens an email that contains an attachment, the file will be put in a remotely accessible web directory. It has been reported that the vulnerable module fails to filter active content passed as attachments, thereby allowing a malicious PHP script to be stored in a web directory.

By accessing a PHP script located in the web directory, arbitrary PHP commands will be executed on the target server.
