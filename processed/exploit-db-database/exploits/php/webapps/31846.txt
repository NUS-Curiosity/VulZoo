ClassSystem is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data. These issues include multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to compromise the application, execute arbitrary code, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

ClassSystem 2 and 2.3 are affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.
