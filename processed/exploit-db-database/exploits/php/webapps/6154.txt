# Risk : SQL Injection
##########################################################


Description:
ViArt Shop is a full featured online ecommerce solution written
in php. There is a high risk SQL Injection in ViArt that allows
for an attacker to take over the ViArt installation. This
vulnerability is present regardless of magic_quotes configuration.
An updated version of ViArt has been released and all users are
encouraged to upgrade their ViArt installation as soon as possible.


SQL Injection:
There is a high risk SQL Injection vulnerability in ViArt that
allows for an attacker to run arbitrary queries via a malicious
request. The vulnerable code can be found in "products_rss.php".
As seen below the "$category_id" variable is never sanitized within
the query, and is never sanitized prior to that point either.

if ($category_id == 0){
    $sql = "SELECT category_id, friendly_url FROM " . $table_prefix . "categories WHERE category_path like '%".$category_id.",%' AND is_showing = 1 ";
} else {
    $sql = "SELECT category_id, friendly_url FROM " . $table_prefix . "categories WHERE category_path like '%,".$category_id.",%' AND is_showing = 1 ";
}

This allows for an attacker to easily select arbitrary data
from the database such as usernames,passwords, and even credit
card information. it should also be noted that ViArt strips
slashes from within the get_param() function, so magic_quotes
does not prevent this SQL Injection from happening.

/products_rss.php?category_id=1' UNION SELECT concat(login,char(58),password),0 FROM va_admins -- /*

A url like the one above will successfully grab the admin info
from the database, and then attempt to use the admin data in a
query, where it will then error. Still, the admin credentials
will be displayed in the SQL Error as part of the faulty query
and visible to the attacker. It is also worth mentioning that
ViArt stores all credentials in plain text, so once an attacker
has the credentials he is guaranteed access to the application.



Solution:
The ViArt developers have released a patch for the vulnerable
ViArt 3.5. Users are encouraged t upgrade as soon as possible.
