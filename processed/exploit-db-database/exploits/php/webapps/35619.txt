PhoenixCMS is prone to a local file-include vulnerability and an SQL-injection vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit the local file-include vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to view and execute arbitrary local files within the context of the webserver process.

The attacker can exploit the SQL-injection vulnerability to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

PhoenixCMS 1.7.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
