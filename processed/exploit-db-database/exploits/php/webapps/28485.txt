developed from the idea of Nando Vieira <a href="http://bit.ly/d38gB8"
rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/d38gB8</a>, but some themes do not support
changes to the functions.php to this we alter this function and
available as a plugin. Make good use of this plugin and forget all the Spam.

[ Bug Description ]

NOSpamPTI contains a flaw that may allow an attacker to carry out a
Blind SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the wp-comments-post.php

may allow an attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the
back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of
arbitrary data.
