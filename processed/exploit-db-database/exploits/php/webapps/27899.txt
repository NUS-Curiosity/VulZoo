DownloadControl is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

DownloadControl 1.0 is reported vulnerable. Other versions may be affected as well.
