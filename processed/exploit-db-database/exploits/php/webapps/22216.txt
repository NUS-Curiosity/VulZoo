Finding 1: Local File Inclusion Vulnerability
CVE: CVE-2012-5192

The 'overlay_type' parameter in the 'gmap/view_overlay.php' page in
Bitweaver is vulnerable to a local file inclusion vulnerability.

This vulnerability can be demonstrated by traversing to a known readable
path on the web server file system.

Example:

Performing LFI on 'overlay_type' parameter

#Request

http://A.B.C.D/bitweaver/gmap/view_overlay.php?overlay_type=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F/etc/passwd%00

#Response

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
<snip>

Finding 2: Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities in Bitweaver
CVE: CVE-2012-5193

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been discovered
that allow remote unauthenticated users to run arbitrary scripts on the
system.

The following Proof of Concepts illustrate that Bitweaver 2.8.1 is
vulnerable to XSS.

Remediation Steps:
The vendor has released a fix to address the Local File Inclusion
vulnerability (finding 1) and several of the Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities (finding 2) in Bitweaver 3.1. However, additional fixes for
the Cross-site Scripting vulnerabilities were made on commit c3bef6f in the
development branch.  Users are recommended to download the latest release
of Bitweaver on http://github.com/bitweaver to address the above issues.

These issue can also be mitigated with the use of technologies, such as Web
Application Firewalls (WAF) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). Often,
Vulnerability Scanners and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can detect the
presence of Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities and XSS. Trustwave
technologies that address this issue include the following.

ModSecurity (http://www.modsecurity.org/) has added rules to the commercial
rules feed for these issues, available as part of the SpiderLabs
ModSecurity rules feed.

Trustwave's vulnerability scanning solution, TrustKeeper
(https://www.trustwave.com/trustKeeper.php), has been updated to detect
affected versions.
