Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========

1.1
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in the PG Dating Pro v1.0 CMS, turnkey PHP dating software to start internet dating service.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to execute a SQL commands on the affected application dbms.
The sql injection vulnerability is located in events.php file with the bound vulnerable id_event parameter. Successful exploitation of the
vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise. Exploitation requires no user interaction & without privileged user account.

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] events.php

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] edit_event

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] id_event


1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the PG Dating Pro v1.0 CMS, turnkey PHP dating software to start internet dating service.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject own malicious script code on the application side (persistent). The persistent vulnerabilities are located
in the shoutbox, edit questions modules with the bound vulnerable message and title. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking
(manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged web application user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Shoutbox
				[+] admin -> Questions & Answers


Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] the message we write in the shout box
				[+] title


Proof of Concept:
=================

1.2
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low or medium required user inter action
& low privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.2.1

>"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com onload=alert("VL")</iframe>
When the admin or any user view anypage where the shoutbox is displayed the code gets executed.

1.2.2
If an attacker has admin rights he can inject all users by posting a question and editing it is title to have a malicious code,
such as >"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com onload=alert("VL")</iframe>


Risk:
=====
