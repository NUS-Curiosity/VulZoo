Support Incident Tracker is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Support Incident Tracker 3.63p1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
