Problems with JAWMail could make it possible to execute arbitrary script code in a vulnerable client.

JAWMail does not sufficiently filter malicious HTML code from e-mails. As a result, when a user opens an email in JAWMail that contains malicious HTML code, the code contained in the mail would be executed in the browser of the mail user.
