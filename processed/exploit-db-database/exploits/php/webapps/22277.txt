A vulnerability has been discovered in Nuked-Klan which may be exploited to execute certain PHP functions on a target server. This issue occurs in the 'Team', 'News', and 'Lien' modules and is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied URI parameters.

This issue may be exploited by a remote attacker to obtain sensitive server information, which could aid in launching further attacks against a target system.

The vulnerability was reported for Nuked-Klan beta 1.3; earlier versions may also be affected.
