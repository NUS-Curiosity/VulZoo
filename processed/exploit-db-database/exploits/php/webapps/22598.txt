The Web_Links module for PHP-Nuke has been reported prone to a vulnerability which, when exploited, may disclose sensitive path information to a remote attacker.

An attacker may use the information gathered in this manner to mount further attacks against the host.

It should be noted that although PHP-Nuke version 6.x has been reported vulnerable, other versions might also be affected.
