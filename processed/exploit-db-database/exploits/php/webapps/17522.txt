# Version: 2.0.1

There is a vulnerability on Fire Soft Board forums due to a non-sanitization of the $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] variable from every client
(even visitors) of the site. This variable is printed as a span title in the admin panel overview witch can lead to a session hijack or
bEEf exec or whatever you want.

PoC : - modify your user agent by something like : "><script>alert(document.cookie)</script><span title="
      - go to any page of the forum
      - login into your admin panel -> popup with your cookies :-)

Fix : upgrade to last release (2.0.2)

-= Greatz to x =-
