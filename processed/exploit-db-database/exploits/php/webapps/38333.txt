phpMyRecipes is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code could be executed in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks may also be possible.

phpMyRecipes 1.2.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
