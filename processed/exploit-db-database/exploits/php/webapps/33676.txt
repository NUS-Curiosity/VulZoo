Newbie CMS is prone to an authentication-bypass vulnerability because it fails to adequately verify user-supplied input used for cookie-based authentication.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrative access to the affected application, which may aid in further attacks.

Versions prior to Newbie CMS 0.03 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

Supplying the following cookie data is sufficient to exploit this issue:

javascript:document.cookie="nb_logged=jiko;path=/newbb/admin/";
