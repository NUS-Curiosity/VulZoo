Brooky CubeCart is reported prone to multiple vulnerabilities. These issues result from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data and may allow remote attackers to disclose arbitrary files and carry out cross-site scripting attacks.

The application is reportedly susceptible to a remote directory traversal vulnerability. A malicious user could issue a request containing directory traversal strings such as '../' to possibly view files outside the server root directory in the context of the server.

The application is also prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI input. This may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

CubeCart 2.0.4 and prior versions are considered to be vulnerable to these issues.
