Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher Team discovered multiple Vulnerabilities in MYREs Real Estate Mobile
Application (2012 Q2).


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-05-01:     Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple remote SQL Injection vulnerabilities are detected in MYREs Real Estate Mobile Application (2012 Q2).
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
The vulnerability is located on the link_idd & userid value of the mobile application.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                [+] Listings - Link_IDD
                                [+] Agent Profile - UserID

                                ../2.png


1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in MYREs Real Estate Mobile Application (2012
Q2).
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing
& client-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                [+] Search - bedrooms1
                                [+] Search - price2

                                ../4.png


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The SQL Injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker without required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
http://SITE/realestate/1_mobile/listings.php?link_idd=-13+UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,
34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51--%20

http://SITE/realestate/1_mobile/agentprofile.php?userid=16+union+select[SQL-INJECTION!]


1.2
The client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with medium
till high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated as critical.

1.2
The security risk of the non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as low(+).
