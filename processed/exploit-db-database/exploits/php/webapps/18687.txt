Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in LandShop CMS v0.9.2

Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detected on LandShops Web Application v0.9.2.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] admin/action/objects.php [OB_ID=106]
                                [+] admin/action/areas.php [AREA_ID=9]
                                [+] admin/action/pdf.php [start=2]



2.1
A persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected on LandShops Web Application v0.9.2.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent)
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Create Object - Input/Output Name


2.2
A persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected on LandShops Web Application v0.9.2. The bugs allow remote
attackers with high required user inter action to edit user accounts. Successful exploitation can lead to account access.
To exploit the issue the attacker need to create a manipulated copy the edit user mask/form. Inside of the document the
remote can implement his own values for the update because of no form or token protection. When admin get now forced to
execute the script via link he is executing the new value on the update of the application if his session is not expired.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Edit Users Form

Proof of Concept:
=================
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without required user inter action.
The persistent web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium & high required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1
http://127.0.0.1/landshop/admin/action/objects.php?action=single&OB_ID=106[SQL-INJECTION]

http://127.0.0.1/landshop/admin/action/pdf.php?action=show&start=20[SQL-INJECTION]*&keyword=&search_area=
&search_type=&search_order=OTR_HEAD

http://127.0.1.1/landshop/admin/action/areas.php?action=single&AREA_ID=5%27[SQL-INJECTION]


2.1
The issue can be exploited by an insert on the Create Object function with script code as value.
The result is the persistent execution out of the web application context.

Strings: >"<<iframe src=http://xxxxx.com/>3</iframe> ... or >"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script><div style="1


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the pre auth sql injection vulnerability is estimated as critical.

2.1
The security risk of the persisten input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium.

2.2
The security risk of the cross site request forgery vulnerability is estimated as low.
