Reportedly, an attacker can carry out directory-traversal attacks. These issues present themselves when the application processes malformed archives.

A successful attack can allow the attacker to place potentially malicious files and overwrite files on a computer in the context of the user running the affected application. A successful exploit may aid in further attacks.
