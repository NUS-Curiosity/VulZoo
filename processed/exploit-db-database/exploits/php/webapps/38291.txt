EasyITSP is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Remote attackers can use specially crafted requests with directory-traversal sequences ('../') to access arbitrary files in the context of the application. This may aid in further attacks.

EasyITSP 2.0.7 and prior versions are vulnerable.
