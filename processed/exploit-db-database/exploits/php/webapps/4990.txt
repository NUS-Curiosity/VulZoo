There exist numerous SQL injection vulnerabilities in phpIP 4.3.2, and
probably previous versions. Most of the data obtained from the request
variables ($_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIE, etc) is not sanitized before it is
passed to MySQL. This may result in un-authorized administrative
access to phpIp and read-access to the database, among other things.

One such vulnerability allows an attacker to gain administrative
access to the application, this does not require the attacker to
already have access to an existing user account.

Proof of concept:
Go to the phpIP login page and enter a valid username ('phpip'
typically works, if not try 'admin') with the following password:

a') UNION SELECT 1,1,'Administrator',1,1,1,1,1 #

At this point you will be logged in as an Administrator with the
supplied username.

There is also the risk of information disclosure through another SQL
injection vulnerability found in display.php. The following PoC
demonstrates a query that will echo a userid, username, MD5-hashed
password, and email address to the page. You must be logged in to take
advantage of this vulnerability (see above.)

Proof of concept:
http(s)://path/to/phpip/display.php?range=view&id=0%20UNION%20SELECT%20null,null,null,null,null,null,uid,username,password,email,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null%20%20FROM%20users--&iprange=0&netid=0
