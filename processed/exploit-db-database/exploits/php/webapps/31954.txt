The 'benja CMS' program is prone to multiple vulnerabilities because it fails to adequately validate input and restrict access. These issues include three cross-site scripting issues, an arbitrary-file-upload issue, and a vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to an administrative script.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, to run arbitrary script code in the context of the application, or to access administrative scripts.

These issues affect 'benja CMS 0.1'; other versions may also be affected.
