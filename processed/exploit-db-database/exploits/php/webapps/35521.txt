osCSS is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and open or run arbitrary files in the context of the webserver process.

osCSS 2.1.0 RC12 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
