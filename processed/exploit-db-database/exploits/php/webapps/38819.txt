Course Registration Management System is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database; other attacks are also possible.

Course Registration Management System 2.2.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
