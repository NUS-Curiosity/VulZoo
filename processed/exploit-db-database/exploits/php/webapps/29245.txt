Messageriescripthp is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including SQL-injection and cross-site scripting issues, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Messageriescripthp V2.0 is vulnerable to this issue.
