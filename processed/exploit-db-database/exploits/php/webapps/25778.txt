Calendarix is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting the SQL-injection issues could allow attackers to compromise the application, obtain or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database. Exploiting the cross-site scripting issues may allow the attacker to run arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user, which may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
