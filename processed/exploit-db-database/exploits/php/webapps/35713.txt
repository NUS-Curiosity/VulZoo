FestOS is prone to an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to upload arbitrary code and run it in the context of the webserver process.

FestOS 2.3c is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
