webEdition CMS is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit will allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

webEdition CMS 6.3.3.0 through 6.3.8.0 svn6985 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
