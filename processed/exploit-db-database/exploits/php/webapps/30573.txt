Sisfo Kampus is prone to an arbitrary-file-download vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to download arbitrary files within the context of the webserver process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks.

This issue affects SisfoKampus 2006; other versions may also be vulnerable.
