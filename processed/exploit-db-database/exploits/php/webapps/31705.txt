PHCDownload is prone to an SQL-injection and a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks. Attackers may also exploit these issues to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

PHCDownload 1.1.0 is vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.
