OrangeHRM is prone to an SQL-injection and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

OrangeHRM 2.7 RC is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
