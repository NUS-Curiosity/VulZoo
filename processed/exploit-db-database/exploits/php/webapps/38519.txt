Jojo CMS is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Jojo CMS 1.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
