eliteCMS is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers may exploit this issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

eliteCMS 1.0 and 1.01 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
