Exploit Description:
Stable with Firefox 34.0.5. Other browsers may be unstable or may not work. When an authenticated admin is exposed to the code below it will do a couple things. "CSRF 1" allows a registered user to escalate their privileges to Collaborator Admin with access to the "files" plugin. This will allow the attacker to upload a php shell to compromise the server. Once executed the attacker would log into the website as normal then proceed to site.com/admin where it greets them with "AttackerName, enter your password :" and login with the same password you registered with. Hover over "General Management" and then click "Files" where the you can upload a shell of your choosing.

"CSRF 2" As stated earlier the admin has to be authenticated for this to work.  However, the attacker doesn't need an account for "CSRF 2" to work. If the attacker does have an account "CSRF 1" and "CSRF 2" are both automatically executed when the page is loaded giving them 2 ways in. All that is needed on the attacker's end is to go to site.com/file/up.php, upload your shell and access it at site.com/file/shell_name.php The admin must have access to the "files" plugin.

Thanks: Fred, d1ch4do, & to all of the people who don't believe in me.
