The PostNuke 'user.php' script does not sufficiently sanitize data supplied via URI parameters, making it prone to cross-site scripting attacks. This could allow for execution of hostile HTML and script code in the web client of a user who visits a web page that contains the malicious code.

Exploitation could allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.
