Description of Vulnerability:
- - - -----------------------------
Drupal (http://drupal.org) is a robust content management system (CMS)
written in PHP and MySQL that provides extensibility through various
third party modules.  The Sections module
(http://drupal.org/project/sections) "allows you to create sections
within your site. Each section has an installed template, theme or style
attached to it."

The Sections module contains a cross site scripting vulnerability
because it does not properly sanitize output of section names before
display.

Systems affected:
- - - -----------------
Drupal 6.14 with Sections 6.x-1.2 was tested and shown to be vulnerable.

Impact:
- - - -------
XSS vulnerabilities may expose site administrative accounts to
compromise which could lead to web server process compromise.

Mitigating factors:
- - - -------------------
The Sections module must be installed.  To carry out a Sections based
XSS proof of concept exploit below the attacker must have 'administer
sections' permissions.

Proof of Concept:
- - ---------------------
1.  Install Drupal 6.14
2.  Install Sections 6.x-1.2
3.  Enable the Sections module from Administer -> Site building -> Modules
4.  Click Administer -> Site building -> Sections
5.  Click the 'Add section' button
5.  Enter "<script>alert('xss');</script>" in the 'Name' text area
6.  Click the 'Add section' button to save the section and observe the
rendered JavaScript
7.  Click on the 'Sections' link in the navigation to observe the
rendered JavaScript

Technical details:
- - ------------------------
The Sections module fails to sanitize the output of the section name
before display.  Applying the following patch fixes this vulnerability.
