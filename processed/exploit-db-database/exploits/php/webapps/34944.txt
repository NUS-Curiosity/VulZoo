SmartOptimizer is prone to a remote information-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to view the source code of files in the context of the server process; this may aid in further attacks.

SmartOptimizer 1.7 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
