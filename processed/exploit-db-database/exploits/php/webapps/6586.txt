>> Program description (by the author website) <<

Crux Gallery reads directories on a server and listes them with thumbnails for
the user to view without useing exrta space for thumbnails or extra bandwidth
for full images. Each image has other resolutions near them for the user to
choose from, including the origional resolution the image is in.

>> Bug <<

You can access to the admin panel altering the cookie and adding a parameter
in the navigation bar.


>> Exploit <<

Note: POST is not checked and you can enter all by GET. Also you can create a
simple perl script to send GET and POST packages.

Navigate by the admin panel adding the parameter '&name=users' in the
navigation bar. Examples:

	to view the main admin panel:
	http://site/index.php?op=admin&name=users

	to change the admin password:
	http://site/index.php?op=pass&name=users
