Bandersnatch is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input. These issues include multiple SQL-injections vulnerabilities and an HTML-injection vulnerability.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, execute malicious script code, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

This issue affects Bandersnatch 0.4; other versions may also be affected.
