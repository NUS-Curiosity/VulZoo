BigDump is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability, an SQL-injection vulnerability, and an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability because it fails to sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, upload arbitrary files, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

BigDump 0.29b and 0.32b are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
