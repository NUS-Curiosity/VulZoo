Jaw Portal is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities using directory-traversal strings to execute arbitrary local PHP scripts within the context of the webserver process.

Jaw Portal 1.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
