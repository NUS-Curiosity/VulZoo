paFaq is reportedly affected by an SQL injection vulnerability. This issue exists because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

This vulnerability is reported to affect paFaq beta4; earlier versions may also be affected.
