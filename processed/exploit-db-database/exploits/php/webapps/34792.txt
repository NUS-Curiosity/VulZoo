Swinger Club Portal is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to access or modify data, exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database, obtain potentially sensitive information, or execute arbitrary script code in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.
