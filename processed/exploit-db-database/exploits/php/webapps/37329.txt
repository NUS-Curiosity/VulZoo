Nilehoster Topics Viewer is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database. By using directory-traversal strings to execute local script code in the context of the application, the attacker may be able to obtain sensitive information that may aid in further attacks.

Topics Viewer 2.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
