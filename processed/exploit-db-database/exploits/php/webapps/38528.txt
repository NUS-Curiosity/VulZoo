via HTTP requests without performing any validity checks to
verify the requests. This can be exploited to perform certain
actions with administrative privileges if a logged-in user visits
a malicious web site. Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
were also discovered. The issue is triggered when input passed
via the multiple parameters is not properly sanitized before
being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute
arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in
context of an affected site.
