Vendor description:
-------------------
"OpenEMR is the most popular open source electronic health records and medical
practice management solution. ONC certified with international usage,
OpenEMR's goal is a superior alternative to its proprietary counterparts."

Source: http://www.open-emr.org/


Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the vulnerability documented in this advisory, an attacker can
fully compromise the web server which has OpenEMR installed. Potentially
sensitive health care and medical data might get exposed through this attack.

SEC Consult recommends not to attach OpenEMR to the network until a thorough
security review has been performed by security professionals and all
identified issues have been resolved.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. OS Command Injection
Any OS commands can be injected by an authenticated attacker with any role.
This is a serious vulnerability as the chance for the system to be fully
compromised is very high.

2. Reflected Cross Site Scripting
This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious client side
scripting which will be executed in the browser of users if they visit the
manipulated site. There are different issues affecting various components.
The flash component has not been fixed yet as OpenEMR is looking for a
replacement component.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. OS Command Injection
Below is the detail of a HTTP request that needs to be sent to execute arbitrary
OS commands through "fax_dispatch.php".

URL     : http://$DOMAIN/interface/fax/fax_dispatch.php?scan=x
METHOD  : POST
PAYLOAD : form_save=1&form_cb_copy=1&form_cb_copy_type=1&form_images[]=x&form_
filename='||<os-commands-here>||'&form_pid=1


2. Reflected Cross Site Scripting
The following URL parameters have been identified to be vulnerable against
reflected cross site scripting:

The following payload shows a simple alert message box:
a)
URL     : http://$DOMAIN/library/openflashchart/open-flash-chart.swf
METHOD  : GET
PAYLOAD : [PoC removed as no fix is available]

b)
URL     :
http://$DOMAIN/library/custom_template/ckeditor/_samples/assets/_posteddata.php
METHOD  : POST
PAYLOAD : <script>alert('xss');</script>=SENDF


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
OpenEMR version 5.0.0 has been tested. This version was the latest
at the time the security vulnerability was discovered.

Solution:
---------
The vendor has fixed the code execution issue and XSS 2b) in GIT in March 2017:
https://github.com/openemr/openemr/commit/ee0945a30dbb17ceee82b9b553d7dcb177710ca8#diff-1fdae02fadfcbc6147352cdc7c63279a
The fix has been incorporated in 5.0.0 Patch 2 or higher.
The XSS example 2a (flash) is not yet fixed.

Because of critical security issues (CVE-2017-16540) of other security
researchers it is highly recommended to upgrade to at least version
5.0.0 Patch 6 immediately.
