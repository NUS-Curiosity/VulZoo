Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability  is detected in the Promans Xpress 2012 Q2 content management system.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
The vulnerability is located on the username post method.

Vulnerable Module(s):
            [+] Category Edit  [category_edit.php?cid=]

1.2
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected n the Promans Xpress 2012 Q2 content management system.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent)
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action. The bug is located on the comment section of
the message reply function.


Vulnerable Module(s):
            [+] Replying for a Message - Comments

Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged account.

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high(-).

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).
