Introduction:
=============
Banana Dance is an open-source PHP/MySQL-based program. It is designed to combine the simplicity of wiki-publishing
software with the versatility of a CMS. The program also promotes community-building through organized and
user-rated commenting features. Highly flexible with theme-integration and extension availability Banana Dance
can be used for all types of purposes, whether it be to create an entire website, a product owner`s manual, or
an `article`-posting site.

Abstract:
=========
The vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple web vulnerabilities in the official BananaDance Wiki b2.2 CMS.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-11-10:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
A SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in the BananaDance Wiki B2.2 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local privileged moderator/admin user account to execute own
SQL commands on the affected application dbms. The sql injection vulnerability is located in user management module
with the bound vulnerable alpha listing parameter. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms &
application compromise. Exploitation requires no user interaction & without privileged user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] User Management

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] alpha


1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the BananaDance Wiki B2.2 Content Management System.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent) of the vulnerable module.
The persistent vulnerabilities are located in the user, banned user, badge module listing with the bound vulnerable username and email parameters.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation.
Exploitation requires low user inter action (view listing) & a registered low privileged web application user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Add User - Listing
				[+] Banned User - Listing
				[+] Badges - Listing

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Username & Email (Profil)


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerability can be exploited by local privileged user accounts and moderators.

1.2
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with low privileged application user account and
low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the local sql injection vulnerability is estimated as medium(+) because of the required moderator account.

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as high.
