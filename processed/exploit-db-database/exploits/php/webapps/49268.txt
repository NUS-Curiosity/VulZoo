XSS ATTACK:
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a client-side code injection attack. The
attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a web browser of the victim
by including malicious code in a legitimate web page or web application.
The actual attack occurs when the victim visits the web page or web
application that executes the malicious code. The web page or web
application becomes a vehicle to deliver the malicious script to the userâ€™s
browser. Vulnerable vehicles that are commonly used for Cross-site
Scripting attacks are forums, message boards, and web pages that allow
comments.
