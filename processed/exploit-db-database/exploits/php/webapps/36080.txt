Hotel Portal is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.
