Details.
A vulnerability has been discovered in the Wordpress plugin BackWPup
1.6.1 which can be exploited to execute local or remote code on the web
server. The Input passed to the component "wp_xml_export.php" via the
"wpabs" variable allows the inclusion and execution of local or remote
PHP files as long as a "_nonce" value is known. The "_nonce" value
relies on a static constant which is not defined in the script meaning
that it defaults to the value "822728c8d9".

Proof of Concept.
