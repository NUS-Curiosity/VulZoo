Zeecareers is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and multiple authentication-bypass vulnerabilities.

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

The attacker may leverage the authentication-bypass issues to access information without proper authentication.

Zeecareers version 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
