--==+================================================================================+==--



Discovered By: t0pP8uZz
Discovered On: 14 MAY 2008
Script Download: N/A
DORK (alot more sites, people remove dork): " ActiveKB v1.5 Copyright Â©"



Vendor Has Not Been Notified!



DESCRIPTION:

ActiveKB suffers from an insecure cookie, when the admin details are checked the script creates a cookie,
to let the script know in future the user is already been checked and is admin. The thing is that, the cookie
only contains a "true" value. So this allows the remote attacker to craft a cookie (which the script didnt create of course)
and gain access to the admin area.

pasting the below javascript code into your browser, will create a cookie then you have access to /admin/



Exploit:

javascript:document.cookie = "auth=true; path=/";



NOTE/TIP:

after running the above js code, visit /admin/
