Papoo is prone to an authentication-bypass vulnerability because the application fails to check user privileges when accessing the administration pages.

An attacker can exploit this issue to gain access to administration plugins. This may lead to other attacks.

This issue affects Papoo 3.6; prior versions may also be affected.
