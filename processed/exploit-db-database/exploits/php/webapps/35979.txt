Willscript Recipes website Script Silver Edition is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
