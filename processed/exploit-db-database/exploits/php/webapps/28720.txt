Web//News is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to include an arbitrary remote file containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate a compromise of the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Web//News 1.4 and prior versions are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
