I. ABOUT THE APPLICATION
________________________

Squirrelcart PRO  is  a  commercial  and  used  PHP/MySQL
e-commerce system.

I tested only the demo versions.  Other versions could be
vulnerable. I obtained the demo's version value from  the
staff.


II. DESCRIPTION
_______________

A parameter is not properly sanitised  before  being used
in a SQL query.


III. ANALYSIS
_____________

Summary:

 A) Blind SQL Injection


A) Blind SQL Injection
______________________

The parameters prod_rn in index.php when  add_to_cart  is
set to a positive value is not properly sanitised  before
being  used  in a  SQL  query. This  can  be exploited to
manipulate  SQL  queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

This  vulnerability  doesn't  requires  to be  logged in.

Successful exploitation requires that  the  first part of
the injection (in the sample code it is 271)  must  be  a
valid product number (just see the products list).


IV. SAMPLE CODE
_______________

A) Blind SQL Injection

http://site/path/index.php?add_to_cart=10&prod_rn=271 AND (SELECT(IF(0x41=0x41, BENCHMARK(9999999999,NULL),NULL)))

V. FIX
______

No fix.
