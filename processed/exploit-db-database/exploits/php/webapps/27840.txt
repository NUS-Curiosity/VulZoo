Dynamic Galerie is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the affected application or to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
