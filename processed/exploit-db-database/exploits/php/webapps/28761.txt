WikyBlog is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

WikyBlog 1.2.3 and earlier versions are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

Update: This BID is being retired; further information reveals that the application is not vulnerable to this issue.
