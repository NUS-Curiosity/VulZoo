AVA VoIP is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, upload and execute arbitrary files in the context of the web server, and launch other attacks.

AVA VoIP 1.5.12 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
