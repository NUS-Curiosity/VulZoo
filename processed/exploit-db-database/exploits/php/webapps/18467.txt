# Exploit Title: XRayCMS 1.1.1 SQL Injection Vulnerability
# Date: 2/5/2012
# Author: chap0

# Version: 1.1.1
# Tested on: Ubuntu


XRay CMS is vulnerable to a SQL Injection attack which allows
authentication bypass into the admins account. If a malicious
user supplies ' or 1=1# into the applications user name field
they will be logged into the applications admin account.


Jan 29, 2012 – Contacted Vendor No Response
Feb 05, 2012 – Public Disclosure

Since the vendor did not reply we attempted to create our own
fixes for this issue. The vulnerability exist in “login2.php”
on lines 20 and 21.

17	if(!isset($_POST['username'])) header("Location: login.php?error_username");
18	if(!isset($_POST['password'])) header("Location: login.php?error_password");
19
20	$user = $_POST['username'];
21	$pass = $_POST['password'];

If the lines 20 and 21 are changed to:

$user = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
$pass = mysql_real_escape_string($_POST['password']);

This will prevent the sql injection from happening in the user name field.
