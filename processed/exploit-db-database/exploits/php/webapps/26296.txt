PHPMyFAQ is prone to a local file include vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code that resides on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may potentially facilitate unauthorized access.

It should be noted that this issue may also be leveraged to read arbitrary files on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server.
