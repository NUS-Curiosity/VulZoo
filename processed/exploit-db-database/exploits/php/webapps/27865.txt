Gphotos is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities. The issues include information-disclosure and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.
