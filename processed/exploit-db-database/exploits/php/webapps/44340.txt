Product: Site Editor Wordpress Plugin - https://wordpress.org/plugins/site-editor/
Vendor: Site Editor
Tested version: 1.1.1
CVE ID: CVE-2018-7422

** CVE description **
A Local File Inclusion vulnerability in the Site Editor plugin through 1.1.1 for WordPress allows remote attackers to retrieve arbitrary files via the ajax_path parameter to editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php.

** Technical details **
In site-editor/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php:5, the value of the ajax_path parameter is used for including a file with PHPâ€™s require_once(). This parameter can be controlled by an attacker and is not properly sanitized.

Vulnerable code:
if( isset( $_REQUEST['ajax_path'] ) && is_file( $_REQUEST['ajax_path'] ) && file_exists( $_REQUEST['ajax_path'] ) ){
    require_once $_REQUEST['ajax_path'];
}

https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/site-editor/trunk/editor/extensions/pagebuilder/includes/ajax_shortcode_pattern.php?rev=1640500#L5

By providing a specially crafted path to the vulnerable parameter, a remote attacker can retrieve the contents of sensitive files on the local system.

** Proof of Concept **
