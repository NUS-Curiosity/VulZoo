Description:
The Opencart Version 3.x.x allows editing Source/HTML of the Categories /
Product / Information pages in the admin panel which isn't sanitized to
user input allowing for an attacker to execute arbitrary javascript code
leading to Stored Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS).

Proof-of-Concept(POC):

1. Log-in to admin-panel.
2. Navigate to Catlog and then select any of [Categories or Products or Information] options and and pick any entry or create one.
3. Under description click on Source option and insert your XSS payload.
i.e: "><script>alert("XSS")</script>
4. Now visit the modified page of your public website. And your injected XSS payload will execute.
