TurnkeyForms Software Directory is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Software Directory 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
