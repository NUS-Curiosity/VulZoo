SPAMINA Cloud Email Firewall is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability using directory-traversal characters ('../') to access arbitrary files that contain sensitive information. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

SPAMINA Cloud Email Firewall 3.3.1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
