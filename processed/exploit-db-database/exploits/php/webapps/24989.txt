Wordpress is reported vulnerable to multiple cross-site scripting, HTML injection, and SQL injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data.

The cross-site scripting and HTML injection issues could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link, or post data to the affected application that includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were to be followed, or resulting pages were to be viewed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the security context of the affected web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

An attacker may exploit the SQL injection issues to manipulate SQL queries to the underlying database. This may facilitate theft of sensitive information, potentially including authentication credentials, and data corruption.
