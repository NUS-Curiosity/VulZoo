WebTitan is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

A remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability using directory-traversal characters ('../') to access arbitrary files containing sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

WebTitan Versions prior to 3.60 are vulnerable.
