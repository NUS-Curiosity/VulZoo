CMS WebManager-Pro is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

CMS WebManager-Pro 7.4.3 is vulnerable; other verisons may also be affected.
