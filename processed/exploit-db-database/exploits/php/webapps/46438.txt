1. Description

C4G Basic Laboratory Information System (BLIS) is an open-source system to track patients, specimens and laboratory results. C4G BLIS is a joint initiative of Computing for Good (C4G) at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Ministries of Health of several countries in Africa.

This allows unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands and obtain private information. Admin or users valid credentials aren't required. In a deeper analysis other pages are also affected with the vulnerability over others inputs.

It written in PHP it is vulnerable to SQL Injection on multiples occurrences. The parameters affected are detailed below:

http://192.168.6.101:4001/ajax/users_select.php [parameters affected via GET method: site]



2. Proof of Concept
