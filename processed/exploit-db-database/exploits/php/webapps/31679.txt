PortailPHP is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to include arbitrary remote files containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate a compromise of the application and the underlying computer; other attacks are also possible.

PortailPHP 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be vulnerable.
