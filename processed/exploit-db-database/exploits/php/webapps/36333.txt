Dolibarr is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Dolibarr 3.1.0 RC is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
