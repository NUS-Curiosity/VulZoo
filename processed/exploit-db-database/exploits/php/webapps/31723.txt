Project Alumni is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and an SQL-injection vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

These issues affect Project Alumni 1.0.9; other versions may also be vulnerable.
