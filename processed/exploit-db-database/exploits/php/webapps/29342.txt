Multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities affect Luckybot because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a PHP 'include()' function call.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the webserver process.

Version 3 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.

NOTE: This BID is being retired because further analysis reveals that these issues are not exploitable.
