webERP is prone to information-disclosure, SQL-injection, and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may exploit the information-disclosure issue to gain access to sensitive information that may lead to further attacks.

An attacker may exploit the SQL-injection issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

webERP 4.0.5 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
