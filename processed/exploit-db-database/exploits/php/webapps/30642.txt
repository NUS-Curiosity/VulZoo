MailBee WebMail Pro is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

These issues affect MailBee WebMail Pro 3.4 and prior versions.
