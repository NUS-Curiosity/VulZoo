iTechClassifieds is prone to an input-validation vulnerability that may be exploited as a cross-site scripting issue or an SQL-injection issue. This issue occurs because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
