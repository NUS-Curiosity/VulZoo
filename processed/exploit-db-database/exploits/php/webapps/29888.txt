Phorum is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including an unauthorized-access issue, privilege-escalation issue, multiple SQL-injection issues, and cross-site scripting issues, because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify sensitive data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Phorum 5.1.20 is affected; prior versions may also be vulnerable.
