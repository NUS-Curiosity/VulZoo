ocPortal is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and an arbitrary file-disclosure vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and obtain sensitive information.

ocPortal versions prior to 7.1.6 are vulnerable.
