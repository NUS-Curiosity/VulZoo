The WP e-Commerce plugin for WordPress is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities, including:

1. Multiple remote code-execution vulnerabilities.
2. A local file-include vulnerability
3. An arbitrary file-upload vulnerability

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code, include arbitrary local files, upload arbitrary files to the affected computer that may result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable application.

WP e-Commerce 3.8.9.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
