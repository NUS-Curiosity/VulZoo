NukeCalendar, which is a third-party calendar module for PHP-Nuke, is prone to multiple vulnerabilities.

These issues include path disclosure, SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Possible consequences include disclosure of sensitive information and account/bulletin board compromise. Attacks against the database implementation itself are also possible through SQL injection.
