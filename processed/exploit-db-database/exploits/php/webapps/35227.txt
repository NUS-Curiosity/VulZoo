Alguest is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Alguest 1.1c-patched is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example POST request is available:

POST /alguest/elimina.php HTTP/1.0
Host: website
Cookie: admin=1
Content-Length: N
send=elimina&elimina=[SQL Injection]
