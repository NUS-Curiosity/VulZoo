Audins Audiens is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including SQL-injection issues and a cross-site scripting issue, because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, retrieve and overwrite sensitive information, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Audins Audiens version 3.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
