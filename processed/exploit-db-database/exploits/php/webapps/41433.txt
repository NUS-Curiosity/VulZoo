Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2017-02-20: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
GNU GPL License
Product: ProjectSend r754


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An insecure direct object references occured in case of an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input.
As a result of this vulnerability attackers can bypass authorization and to access resources in the system. Insecure Direct Object References
allows attackers to bypass authorization and access resources directly by modifying the value of a parameter[client] used. Thus finally point
to other client account names, which allows an attackers to download others clients private data with no secure method provided.

Vulnerability Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] process.php?do=zip_download

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] client
[+] file


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The security vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privilege web-application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

1. User "A" as attacker checks a file to download as zip extension, then click download to modifiy values as required ...

2. Application responds with the client file list, so then you are able to download all other side user B data files with zip extension
