XRMS CRM is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including an unspecified SQL-injection issue, an HTML-injection issue, and multiple cross-site scripting issues. The vulnerabilities occur because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is rendered to the user, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
