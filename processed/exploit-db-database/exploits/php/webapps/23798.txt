The Confixx PERL debugging utility functionality has been reported to be prone to a remote command execution vulnerability. The issue is reported to occur when a command sequence is appended to a HTTP request for a PERL script resource, the command sequence must contain a prefixed ';' semi-colon character. When this request is processed, the command sequence will be reportedly executed with the privileges of the process that invokes the Confixx PERL debugging utility.
