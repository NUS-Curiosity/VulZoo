A vulnerability has been reported for Filemanager that may result in the disclosure of arbitrary files. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied values for URI parameters.

A malicious attacker can specify arbitrary absolute paths as the value of the URI parameter. This will result in the requested file being disclosed to the attacker.
