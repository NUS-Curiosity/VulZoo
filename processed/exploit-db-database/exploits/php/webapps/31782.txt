Claroline is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may allow a remote attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Claroline 1.7.5 is affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.
