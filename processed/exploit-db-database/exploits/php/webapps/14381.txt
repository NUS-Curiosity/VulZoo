# Vulnerability
Remote attacker can execute commands on the system that host target
web application. Its high level vulnerability. Attacker needs gnupg
module that installed.

modules/gnupg/json.php:
$data = $gnupg->export($_REQUEST['fingerprint']);


In json.php export method called with HTTP Request that's name
fingerprint. In the export method, variable $fingerprint passed to
run_cmd method.

modules/gnupg/classes/gnupg.class.inc.php:
public function export($fingerprint)
{
	$this->run_cmd('--armor --export '.$fingerprint, $key);
...
private function run_cmd($cmd, &$output=null, &$errorcode=null,
$data=null, $passphrase=null, $background=false)
{
...
	$complete_cmd .= ' '.$cmd;
...
$p = proc_open($complete_cmd,$this->fd, $this->pipes);
...
