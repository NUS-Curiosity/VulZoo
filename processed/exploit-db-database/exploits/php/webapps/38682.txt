Jahia xCM is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected website. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Jahia xCM 6.6.1.0 r43343 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
