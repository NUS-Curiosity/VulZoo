LineWeb is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities:

- Multiple local file-include vulnerabilities
- An SQL-injection vulnerability
- A security-bypass vulnerability

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary local files within the context of the webserver process, obtain sensitive information, compromise the affected application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

LineWeb 1.0.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
