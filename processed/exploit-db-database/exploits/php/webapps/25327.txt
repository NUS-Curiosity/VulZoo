EPay Pro is reported prone to a remote file include vulnerability.

The problem presents itself specifically when an attacker passes the location of a remote attacker-specified script through the 'view' parameter.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer.

EPay Pro version 2.0 is vulnerable to this issue.
