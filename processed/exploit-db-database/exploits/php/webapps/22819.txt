It has been reported that Tutos does not properly handle input to the file_new script. Because of this, an attacker may be able to upload arbitrary files to a vulnerable site.

We can upload via http://www.example.com/tutos/file/file_new.php?link_id=1065

The path is http://www.example.com/tutos/repository/[project number]/[file
number]/FILE
