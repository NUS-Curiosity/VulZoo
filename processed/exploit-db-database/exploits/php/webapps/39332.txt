Wiser is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to download backup files that contain sensitive information. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

Wiser 2.10 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
