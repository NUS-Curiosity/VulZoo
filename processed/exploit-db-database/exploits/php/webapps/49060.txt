Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in
the official SugarCRM v6.5.18 web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector to
compromise browser to web-application requests from the application-side.

The persistent cross site web vulnerability is located in the primary
address state and alternate address state
input fields of the sales or support module open to create a contacts.
Remote attackers with low privileged
sugarcrm accounts are able to inject own malicious script code as
contact. Higher privileged application user
accounts will execute the script code on preview of the created contact
to e.g gain moderator or administrator
rights via session hijacking, phishing or further persistent
manipulative web attacks. The code does not only
execute in the same section were the contact is listed or previewed but
also after save in the view log function
context. The attack can thus way be performed via create of a contact or
via import of a vcf file contact.
The request method to inject is POST and the attack is limited to
registered user accounts with default
contact to the contacts module.

The script code is able to bypass the basic validation process because
of the primary address state and alternate
address state are exchanged in the transmit request. Normally in a
regular transmit the context is parsed securely.
In the actual case an attacker injects script code in the alternate
adress when changing the main adress the wrong
sanitized code occurs in the front-end.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent
external redirects to malicious source and persistent manipulation of
affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Sales
[+] Support

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Primary Address State
[+] Alternate Address State

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] primary address state
[+] alternate address state

Affected Module(s):
[+] Sales - Contact List
[+] Support - Contact List


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by
remote attackers with low privileged user account and with low user
interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the persistent cross site web
vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Open the sugarcrm application
2. Login as low privileged user account
3. Move to sales or support and click to contact, then open create a new
contact
4. Inject payload in the other address and primary adress to the
alternate address state and primary state input fields
5. Save the entry and a refresh occurs with the inserted contact details
Note: The script code execute immediatly after saving in the primary
adress state and alternate adress state section of both modules
6. Successful reproduce of the persistent cross site scripting web
vulnerability!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched following the next steps ...
1. Restrict the input fields and disallow special chars for the main
name values displayed in the list
2. Escape the input transmitted from the alternate and primary inputs
3. Parse and sanitize the ouput location to ensure its filtered securely


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent cross site web vulnerability in the
sugarcrm web-application is estimated as medium.
