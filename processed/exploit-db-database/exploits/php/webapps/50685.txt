2. Click the "Select Color" button and type the following payload the input space: `hacked</style></head><script>alert(1)</script>`
3. Click the "Save Changes" button to save settings.
4. Create a new page and add the shortcode ([mcwp type="cv"]) of the calculator, for testing.
5. Visit the page to trigger XSS.
