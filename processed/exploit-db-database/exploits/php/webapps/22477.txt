phPay has been reported prone to multiple path disclosure vulnerabilities.

It has been reported that when specially crafted requests are made for many phPay pages and include files, an error condition may be triggered. The resulting error message may contain path information relative to the phPay installation and requested file.

Information gathered in this way may be used in further attacks against the system.

This vulnerability has been reported to affect phPay version 2.02. However, previous versions may also be affected.
