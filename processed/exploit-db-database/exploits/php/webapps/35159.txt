Advisory Details:

Narendra Bhati discovered vulnerability in MODX Revolution, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks & Along With Bypassing CSRF Tokens Protection ,Its allow an attacker to perform A CSRF Attack alosing With XSS to take over victim account by changin promary email address , Sending forged request Etc , Tricking an admin to attack on their own users by sending specially crafter malicous payload as CSRF Attack


1) Cross Site Request Forgery Protection (CSRF) Tokens Bypassing in Modx Revolution

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of csrftokens ["HTTP_MODHAUTH] at server side which allow an attacker to Perform CSRF Attack by bypassing CSRF Protection Mechanism To take over victim account , Trick him to send malicious request Etc.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in MODX Revolution

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of input data passed via the "context_key" HTTP GET parameter to "http://127.0.0.1/day/modx/manager/index.php?a=55&class_key=modStaticResource&context_key=" URL. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.
This vulnerability can be used against website administrator to perform phishing attacks, steal potentially sensitive data and gain complete control over web application.

The exploitation example below uses the ""></script><img src=x onerror=prompt(/XSS/)>" JavaScript function to display "/XSS/" word:

Vulnerable URL - http://127.0.0.1/day/modx/manager/index.php?a=55&class_key=modStaticResource&context_key="></script><img src=x onerror=prompt(/XSS/)>

Vulnerable Parameter - "context_key"

XSS Payload - "></script><img src=x onerror=prompt(/XSS/)>

"></script><img src=x onerror=prompt(document.cookie)>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in MODX Revolution

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of input data passed via the "context" HTTP POST parameter to " http://127.0.0.1/day/modx/manager/index.php?id=1" URL. A local attacker [Authenticated User] can  execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.
This vulnerability can be used against website visitors to perform phishing attacks, steal potentially sensitive data and gain complete control over web application.

The exploitation example below uses the "<script>alert(1)</script>" JavaScript function to display "1" word:

Vulnerable URL - http://127.0.0.1/day/modx/manager/index.php?id=1

Vulnerable Parameter - "context"

XSS Payload - <script>alert(1)</script>

Note - This Stored XSS Was more critical because there was a CSRF protection vulnerability also , which allow an attacker to trick an administrator To Send Unwated Request for Stored XSS , which will directly attack to the Visitors ,
