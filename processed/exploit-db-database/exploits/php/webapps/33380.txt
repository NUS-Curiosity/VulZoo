Power Phlogger is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit this issue to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user.

Power Phlogger 2.2.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
