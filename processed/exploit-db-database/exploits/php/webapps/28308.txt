PHP MySQL Banner Exchange is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit the SQL-injection vulnerabilities to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

An attacker may also leverage the remote file-include issue to include an arbitrary remote file containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process.

Version 2.1 of the application is affected by these vulnerabilities; other versions may also be affected.
