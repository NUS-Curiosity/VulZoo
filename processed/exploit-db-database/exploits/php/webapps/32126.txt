ScrewTurn Wiki is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

The issue affects ScrewTurn Wiki 2.0.29 and 2.0.30; other versions may also be affected.
