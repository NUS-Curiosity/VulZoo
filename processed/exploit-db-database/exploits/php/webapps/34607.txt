TBDev is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including a remote file-include issue and an SQL-injection issue.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to execute malicious code within the context of the webserver process, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

TBDev 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
