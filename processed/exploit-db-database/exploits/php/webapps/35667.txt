Multiple Joostina components are prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because they fail to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the applications, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

The following components are vulnerable:

'com_frontpage' 1.3.0.4_stable
'com_users'

Other components may also be affected.
