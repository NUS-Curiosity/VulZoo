Irokez Blog is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities:

- A cross-site scripting issue
- An SQL-injection issue
- Multiple remote file-include issues

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, execute arbitrary code, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Irokez Blog 0.7.3.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
