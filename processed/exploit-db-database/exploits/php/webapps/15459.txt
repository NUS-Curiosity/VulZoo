-:: The Advisory ::-
Seo Panel is prone to Critical File Disclosure due to download.php does not sanitize user-
input properly via the "file" GET-parameter.
By using ....// instead of ../ to traverse through directories and by appending a %00 byte
in the end of the request it is possible to load virtually any file that the webserver user has
read access to. The PHP function which reads & returns the data from the file is: readfile($var);


Proof of Concept URL:
http://example.tld/seopanel/download.php?filesec=sitemap&filetype=text&file=....//config/sp-config.php%00.txt

Note: This attack requires a valid user though it works regardless of any privileges the user might have.
(User registrations are enabled by default as well, making this attack possible in most scenarios.)


-:: Solution ::-
download.ctrl.php: (Line 55-62)
55	function isValidFile($fileName) {
56		$fileName = urldecode($fileName);
		// This tries to prevent directory traversal
57		$fileName = str_replace('../', '', $fileName);
58		if (preg_match('/\.xml$|\.html$|\.txt$/i', $fileName)) {
59			return $fileName;
60		}
61		return false;
62	}

Suggested patch: (Line 55-62)
55	function isValidFile($fileName) {
56		$fileName = urldecode($fileName);
		// This isn't as easy to bypass anymore
57		$fileName = str_replace('..', '', $fileName); // This is changed.
58		if (preg_match('/\.xml$|\.html$|\.txt$/i', $fileName)) {
59			return $fileName;
60		}
61		return false;
62	}
