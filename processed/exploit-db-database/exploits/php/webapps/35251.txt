Pixie is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Pixie CMS 1.04 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

NOTE (May 10, 2011): This BID was previously titled 'Pixie Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities'. It has been re-written because one of the vulnerabilities duplicates an issue described in BID 34189 (Pixie CMS SQL Injection and Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities).
