Live Wire for Wordpress is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities, a cross-site scripting vulnerability, and an information-disclosure vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to deny service to legitimate users, gain access to sensitive information, execute arbitrary script code, or steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks may also be possible.

Live Wire for Wordpress 2.3.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
