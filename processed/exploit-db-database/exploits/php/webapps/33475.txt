dotProject is prone to multiple SQL-injection and HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage the HTML-injection issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is viewed, and launch other attacks.

The attacker may exploit the SQL-injection issues to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

dotProject 2.1.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to expose
sensitive data, such as password hashes, alter the database contents to
introduce stored XSS vulnerabilities, reset administrative user
passwords to allow escalation of privilege and other attacks that could
lead to the compromise of data, user account credentials, or even the
web server.

The following URL&#039;s expose PHP functions that are vulnerable to SQL
injection:


index.php?m=departments&a=addedit&company_id=1&#039;
index.php?m=ticketsmith&a=view&ticket=1&#039;
index.php?m=files&a=index&tab=4&folder=1&#039;

Additionally some forms allow for SQL injection:

*  The ticket creation form index.php?m=ticketsmith&a=post_ticket does
not properly sanitize single quotes in the Name or Email fields
