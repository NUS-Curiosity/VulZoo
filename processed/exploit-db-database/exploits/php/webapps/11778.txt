Advisory Name: Arbitrary File Download in OSSIM

Vulnerability Class: Arbitrary File Download

Release Date: 03-16-2010

Affected Applications: Confirmed in OSSIM 2.2. Other versions may also be affected.

Affected Platforms: Multiple

Local / Remote: Remote

Severity: High – CVSS: 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N)

Researcher: Nahuel Grisolía

Vendor Status: Fixed in OSSIM 2.2.1

Reference to Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: http://www.cybsec.com/vulnerability_policy.pdf

Vulnerability Description:

OSSIM is prone to a Arbitrary File Download vulnerability because the software fails to adequately
sanitize user-supplied input.
The file “download.php” in “/ossiminstall/repository/” directory suffers from an Arbitrary File
Download vulnerability due to the missed input validation on the "file" parameter; in particular no
validation is done on path traversal patterns.

Proof of Concept:

http://192.168.2.35/ossim/repository/download.php?file=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd&name=passwd.txt

Impact:

Through this vulnerability remote and unauthenticated users could download any file accessible by the
Web server and by reading source files a malicious user could read important information such as
database passwords.

Solution: Fixed in OSSIM 2.2.1. See http://www.alienvault.com/community.php?section=News

Advisory Name: Arbitrary File Upload in OSSIM

Vulnerability Class: Arbitrary File Upload

Release Date: 03-16-2010

Affected Applications: Confirmed in OSSIM 2.2. Other versions may also be affected.

Affected Platforms: Multiple

Local / Remote: Remote

Severity: High – CVSS: 9 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Researcher: Nahuel Grisolía

Vendor Status: Fixed in OSSIM 2.2.1

Reference to Vulnerability Disclosure Policy: http://www.cybsec.com/vulnerability_policy.pdf

Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability is caused due to an improper check in
“/ossiminstall/repository/repository_attachment.php” script, allowing the upload of files with arbitrary
extensions to a folder inside the Webroot. This can be exploited to e.g. execute arbitrary PHP code by
uploading a specially crafted PHP script containing some kind of Web Shell.

Proof of Concept:

Select a file with any extension (including PHP) and upload it using the form. The file will be available
inside Webroot.

Impact:

Direct execution of arbitrary PHP code in the Web Server.

Solution: Fixed in OSSIM 2.2.1. See http://www.alienvault.com/community.php?section=News
