Zorum is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.

Version 3.5 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
