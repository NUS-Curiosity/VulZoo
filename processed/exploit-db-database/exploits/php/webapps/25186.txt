Typo3 'cmw_linklist' extension is affected by a remote SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

This issue is reported to affect 'cmw_linklist' extension versions 1.4.1 and earlier.
