A problem with phpPass may allow an attacker to launch a SQL injection attack.

The vulnerability exists in the accesscontrol.php script included with phpPass. Due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, it is possible for a remote user to inject arbitrary SQL into the database used by a vulnerable site. This may allow an attacker to view pages that would normally be restricted.
