Simple Machines Forum (SMF) is prone to a security-bypass vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit this issue to bypass filter restrictions and post spam content onto the affected site. Other attacks are also possible.

SMF 1.1.6 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
