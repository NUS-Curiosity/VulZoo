PHPizabi v0.848b C1 HFP3 database information exposure
--------------------------------------------------------


* I would like to state that I am in no way responsible for how this information is used.
It is just that, information and is provided for informational purposes only.*



An exploit exists in PHPizabi that allows a user using a specially crafted post to disclose
user credentials as well as any other information within the database.  Using the following
format in a post to a users profile will disclose the corresponding field from that users
entry in the database.

FORMAT:

{user.DATABASEFIELD}

The breakdown:

template.class.php  function AssignUser  lines 104-108

                if (is_array($user)) {
                    foreach ($user as $code => $value) {
Vulnerable code    ---------->            $this->Buffer = str_replace("{user.".$code."}", $value, $this->Buffer);
                    }
                }

What happens here is that as an array of database fields is processed, if {user.DATABASEFIELD} is
found in the buffer it is overwritten with the corresponding value from the database.  The
buffer being processed is going to be output as the page.  See where this is going? :)

So the basic process is as this.  Register on PHPizabi site, post a "comment" on the users
profile whos credentials you want to obtain ie the admin.  Being like so

{user.password}

When viewing the profile, click the comments tab and then click "View all comments". This will
disclose the md5 hashed password from the database.

Note this could work on older versions of the software too.  Also any valid database field can
be substituted for password in the above statement.
