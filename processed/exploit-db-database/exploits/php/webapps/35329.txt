PHPXref is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site and steal cookie-based authentication credentials.

Versions prior to PHPXref 0.7 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
