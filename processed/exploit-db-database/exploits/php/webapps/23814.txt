It has been reported that PHP-Nuke may be prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities occur due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data via the 'Your Name', 'nicname', 'fname', 'ratenum', and 'search' fields of 'modules.php' script. Exploitation could allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.
