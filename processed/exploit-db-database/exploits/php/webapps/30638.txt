GForge is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data. A fix is available from the vendor.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

This issue affects GForge 4.6; other versions may also be affected.
