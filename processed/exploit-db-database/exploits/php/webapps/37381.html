The IDoEditor component for Joomla! is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers upload arbitrary files because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to upload arbitrary code and run it in the context of the web server process.

IDoEditor 1.6.16 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
