PHPLDAPAdmin is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the browser of a victim user in the context of the affected website. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, to control how the site is rendered to the user, and to launch other attacks.
