KDPics is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting and remote file-include issues, because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit may allow unauthorized users to view files, to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of the browser, and to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

KDPics 1.16 and prior versions are vulnerable.
