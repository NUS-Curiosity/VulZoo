It has been reported that phpBB may be prone to multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to carry out SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks. These vulnerabilities result from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input via the 'id' parameter of 'admin_smilies.php' module and the 'style_id' parameter of 'admin_styles' module.

phpBB versions 2.0.7a and prior are reported to be prone to these issues.
