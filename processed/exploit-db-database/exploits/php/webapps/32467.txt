Opera Web Browser is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability.

Successfully exploiting this issue will allow attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application or cause a denial-of-service condition.

NOTE: The security-bypass issue has been reassigned to BID 31643 (Opera Cached Java Applet Privilege Escalation Vulnerability).

Versions prior to Opera 9.60 are vulnerable.
