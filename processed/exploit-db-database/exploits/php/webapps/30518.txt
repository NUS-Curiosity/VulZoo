Ripe Website Manager is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including HTML- and SQL-injection issues.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

These issues affect versions prior to Ripe Website Manager 0.8.10.
