1. Advisory Information
Title: Landesk OS command injection
Advisory Id: CORE-2010-1018
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/content/landesk-os-command-injection-vulnerability
Date published: 2010-11-10
Date of last update: 2010-11-10
Vendors contacted: LANDesk
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. Vulnerability Information
Class: OS command injection [CWE-78]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes (client-side)
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2010-2892
Bugtraq ID: N/A

3. Vulnerability Description
The LANDesk division of Avocent Corporation [1] provides systems management, security management,
service desk, asset management, and process management solutions to organizations. The company's
software is used worldwide.

A security vulnerability was discovered in LANDesk Management Suite: The Landesk web application
does not sufficiently verify if a well-formed request was provided by the user who submitted the
request. Using this information an external remote attacker can run arbitrary code using the
gsbadmin user (that is the user running the web-server).

In order to be able to successfully make the attack, the administrator must be logged in to the
appliance with the browser that the attacker uses to make the attack (for instance, exploiting a
XSS in a different tab in the browser).

4. Vulnerable Packages
LANDesk Management Gateway 4.0 GSBWEB v1.61s
LANDesk Management Gateway 4.2 GSBWEB v1.61
Older versions are probably affected too

5. Non-Vulnerable Packages
LANDesk Management Gateway 4.0 GSBWEB v1.62
LANDesk Management Gateway 4.2 GSBWEB v1.62

6. Vendor Information, Solutions And Workarounds
Workaround for non-patched versions:

Launch a SSH console session, or log onto the LDMG console and start a terminal session.
Issue the following command: mv /usr/LANDesk/broker/webroot/gsb/drivers.php ~

8. Technical Description / Proof Of Concept Code
The Landesk web application does not sufficiently verify if a well-formed request was provided
by the user who submitted the request.

Using this information an external remote attacker can run arbitrary code using the gsbadmin user
(that is the user running the web-server), but the gsbadmin user has sudo privileges. Looking at
/etc/sudoers, you can see that the attacker can also take down the firewall (injecting: ; sudo
/subin/firewall stop into DRIVES) and load arbitrary kernel modules (injecting ; sudo
/subin/modprobe /tmp/a_module), effectively taking complete control of the server.

In order to be able to successfully make the attack, the administrator must be logged in to the
ppliance with the browser that the attacker uses to make the attack (for instance, exploiting a
XSS in a different tab in the browser).

8.1. PROOF OF CONCEPT

This PoC is an HTML form (that can be hosted on any web site) that makes a request to the
[server]. The parameter DRIVES contains the actual injection. In the example, we generate the
file /tmp/ATTACKED to show that arbitrary shell commands can be executed in the server.
