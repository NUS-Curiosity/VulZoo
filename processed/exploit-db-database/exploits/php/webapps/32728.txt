MKPortal is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities, including SQL-injection, HTML-injection, cross-site scripting, arbitrary-file-upload, and insecure-temporary-file-creation vulnerabilities.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the webserver, compromise the application, steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users of the site, modify the way the site is rendered, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database. Other attacks may also be possible.

MKPortal 1.2.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
