Invision Power Board (IP.Board) is prone to a security vulnerability that can aid attackers in social-engineering attacks.

Attacker-supplied script code could exploit vulnerabilities in the user's browser or give the user a false sense of security when visiting trusted web pages, which can aid in launching further attacks.

This issue affects IP.Board 2.3.1; other versions may also be affected.
