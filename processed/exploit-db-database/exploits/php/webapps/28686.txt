My-BIC is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because these applications fail to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

This BID is being retired because further analysis reveals that this issue is not exploitable.
