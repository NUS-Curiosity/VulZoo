Graffiti CMS includes a file manager component that allows
unauthenticated users to upload files (including asp.net pages which
allow code execution). All versions are affected by this
vulnerability.

To exploit this issue, it only suffices to access to the following URL.

http://DOMAIN_TLD/GRAFFITI_CMS_INSTALL_DIR/__utility/Telligent_Editor/editor/filemanager/browser/default/browser.html?connector=../../connectors/aspx/connector.aspx
