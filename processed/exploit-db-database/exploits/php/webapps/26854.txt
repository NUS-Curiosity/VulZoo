ezDatabase is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

ezDatabase is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability and a local file include vulnerability. Successful exploitation of these issues may result in the disclosure of sensitive information, a compromise of the database or the execution of arbitrary local server-side script code. This may facilitate a compromise of the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

This issue affects version 2.1.2; other versions may also be affected.
