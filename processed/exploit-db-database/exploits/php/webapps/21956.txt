kmMail does not sufficiently sanitize HTML and script code from the body of e-mail messages. As a result, an attacker may send a malicious message to a user of kmMail that includes arbitrary HTML and script code.

This may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from users of the webmail system. Other attacks are also possible.
