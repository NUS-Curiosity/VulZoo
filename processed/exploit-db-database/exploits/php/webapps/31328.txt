TorrentTrader is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

NOTE: This BID was previously titled 'TorrentTrader 'msg' Parameter Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability'. Following further analysis, the title and multiple details throughout have been changed to better document the issue.

TorrentTrader Classic 1.08 is affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.
