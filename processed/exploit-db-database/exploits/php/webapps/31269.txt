Spyce is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities that can lead to information disclosure or client-side script execution.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks. The attacker can also obtain a server's webroot path.

The issues affect Spyce 2.1.3; other versions may also be vulnerable.
