# Software Description
# PHP Server Monitor is a script that checks whether the servers on your list are up and running on the selected ports.
# It comes with a web based user interface where you can add and remove servers or websites from the MySQL database,
# and you can manage users for each server with a mobile number and email address.
# On the "Add server" page, you can choose
# whether it's a "service" or a "website":

# Vulnerability: Stored XSS
# Label name or pretty much any other text field such as IP
# Inserting html code can pretty much screw up the whole page as well.
# PoC:
# <script>alert('xss');</script>
# <script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
# <iframe>something</iframe>
