A vulnerability has been reported to exist in the software that may allow a remote user to launch cross-site scripting attacks. The problem is reported to exist due to improper sanitizing of user-supplied data in certain URI parameters passed to the default.php script. This vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to construct a malicious link containing HTML or script code that may be rendered in a user's browser upon visiting that link. This attack would occur in the security context of the site.
