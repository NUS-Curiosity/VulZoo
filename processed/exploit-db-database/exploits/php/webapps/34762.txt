CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 6.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

Description
================
CSRF/XSS vulnerablity in Login Widget With Shortcode allows unauthenticated attackers to do anything an admin can do

Vulnerability
================
This plugin is vulnerable to a combination CSRF/XSS attack. An attacker able to convince an admin to visit a link of their choosing is able to insert arbitrary HTML into an admin page.  Using that ability they can use JavaScript to control an admin userâ€™s browser, allowing the attacker to create user accounts, create posts, delete all posts, etc.

Proof of concept
================
If a logged-in administrator user clicks the submit button on this form, a javascript alert will display in the admin screens. (In a real attack the form can be made to auto-submit using Javascript).
<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=login_widget_afo\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"custom_style_afo\" value=\"&lt;/textarea&gt;<script>alert(1)</script>\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"option\" value=\"login_widget_afo_save_settings\">
  <input type=\"submit\">
</form>

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 3.2.1 or later.
