Exponent is reported prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user facilitating theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.

Exponent 0.95 is reported prone to these issues. It is likely that previous versions are vulnerable as well.
