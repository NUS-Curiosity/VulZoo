#Vulnerability description:

360 Web Manager 3.0 makes use of a panel manager which uses a simple file
manager, this script don't require any authorization at all to upload, list,
or even delete files.

We can find this panel at: http://
[site]/adm/barra/assetmanager/assetmanager.php.

By looking the source code we can find the internal path of the application
right next to:"<input type="hidden" name="inpAssetBaseFolder0"
id="inpAssetBaseFolder0"
value=""

Trough a forged post we can manipulate the path of the folder to list or
delete: inpFileToDelete=%2FfileToDelete%2F&inpCurrFolder=%2FpathToList%2F

Also when uploading a file we can easily change the path of the folder by
changing the "inpCurrFolder2" parameter (there's no restriction to upload
php files!).


Possible solutions:

*Use the admin panel session to authenticate the use of the file manager.

*Forbid the upload of files with dangerous extensions such as .php,.php5,
etc.

*Give the appropriate permissions to read files within its own file
directory.
