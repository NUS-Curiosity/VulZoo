The Spellchecker plugin for WordPress is prone to a local file-include vulnerability and a remote file-include vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary local and remote scripts in the context of the webserver process or obtain potentially sensitive information. This may result in a compromise of the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Spellchecker 3.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example URIs are available:
