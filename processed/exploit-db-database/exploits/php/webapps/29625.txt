phpTrafficA is prone to multiple directory-traversal vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the affected application. Information obtained may aid the attacker in further attacks.

phpTrafficA version 1.4.1 is vulnerable to these issues.
