[+] Bugs


- [A] Local File Inclusion

[-] Risk: hight
[-] File affected: index.php

This bug allows a guest to include local files.
The following is the vulnerable code:

...

if (isset($_GET['lang'])) { $_SESSION['lang'] = $_GET['lang'];}

...

<?
include($include_path.'/inc/'.$_GET['page'].'-'.$_SESSION['lang'].'.php');
?>

...


- [B] Information Disclosure

[-] Risk: medium
[-] File affected: database.inc

This file contains reserved informations such as
the username and the password for connecting to
the database. Using .inc extension only, the
content is visible.

- [C] Arbitrary File Upload

[-] Risk: medium
[-] File affected: product_image.php

In the admin directory there are no files that
check if the user has admin privileges. For this
reason a guest can execute the files contained in
this directory. product_image.php contains a form
that allows to upload files on the system but
does not contain functions that check the files
extensions, however a user can upload arbitrary
files.
