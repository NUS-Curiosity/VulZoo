Amazon Webstore is prone to a HTTP response splitting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to influence or misrepresent how Web content is served, cached or interpreted. This could aid in various attacks that attempt to entice client users into a false sense of trust.

This issue reportedly affects Amazon Webstore version 04050100; other versions may also be vulnerable.
