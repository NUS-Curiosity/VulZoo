Multiple path disclosure vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP-Nuke. This issue occurs when requesting a PHP script that shouldn't be accessed directly.

Exploiting this issue will cause the target server to disclose sensitive information about the layout of the filesystem of the host running the vulnerable software. Information of this nature may aid in mounting further attacks against the host.
