PHP-Nuke is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

PHP-Nuke 8.0.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following sample request is available:
