Perlshop is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities including a nondescript input-validation vulnerability, multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, input arbitrary data to restricted parameters, and view arbitrary local files and directories within the context of the webserver. This may let the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and other harvested information, which may aid in launching further attacks.
