Mini Web Shop is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

This issue affects Mini Web Shop 2; other versions may also be affected.
