The 'net2ftp' program is prone to a local file-include vulnerability and a remote file-include vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to obtain sensitive information; other attacks are also possible.

net2ftp 0.98 stable is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
