singapore gallery is prone to directory-traversal and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit the directory-traversal vulnerabilities to retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the webserver process.

The cross-site scripting vulnerability allows an attacker to leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
