The Rat CMS is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including SQL-injection issues and cross-site scripting issues, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

The Rat CMS Pre-Alpha 2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
