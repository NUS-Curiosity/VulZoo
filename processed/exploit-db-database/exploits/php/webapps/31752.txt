Forum Rank System is prone to local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities using directory-traversal strings to view files local scripts in the context of the webserver process. This may aid in further attacks.

Forum Rank System 6 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
