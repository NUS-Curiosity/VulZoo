Pyrophobia is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including multiple local file-include issues and multiple cross-site scripting issues.

An attacker can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, view files, and execute local scripts within the context of the affected webserver. Other attacks are also possible.
