1. Description:
This plugin allows threads to redirect to a URL with optional custom text. The custom text input is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting.

2. Proof of Concept:

- Create a new thread
- Input any Thread Subject and Redirect URL you'd like
- Use the following payload for Your Message     <svg/onload=alert('XSS')>
Anyone who views the thread will execute payload.
