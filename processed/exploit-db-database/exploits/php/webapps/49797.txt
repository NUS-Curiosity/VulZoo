By having the role of a teacher or an administrator or a manager (to have the possibility to create a course):

- Create a new course (http://localhost/moodle/course/edit.php?category=1&returnto=topcat)
- Give any name , short name, date and other things required.
- In "Description" field, click on the "link" button
- In the url field, enter the payload : <img src=1 href=1 onerror="javascript:alert(1)"></img>
- Create the link, an alert window appears (close it several times so that it disappears) , save the course. ("Save and return")

Each time the course description is displayed, the stored xss is activated : activate it by viewing the course, by modifying it, etc.
