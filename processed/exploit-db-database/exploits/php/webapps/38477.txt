Todoo Forum is prone to multiple SQL-injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Todoo Forum 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
