I. ABOUT THE APPLICATION
________________________

Zen Cart   truly   is   the  art  of   e-commerce;  free,
user-friendly,  open  source  shopping cart software. The
ecommerce web site design program is being developed by a
group of like-minded shop owners, programmers, designers,
and consultants that think ecommerce web design could  be
and should be done differently.


II. DESCRIPTION
_______________

A parameter is not properly sanitised before being  used
by the include() PHP's function.


III. ANALYSIS
_____________

Summary:

 A) Local File Inclusion


A) Local File Inclusion
_______________________

Input   passed   to   the   "loader_file"   parameter  in
includes/initsystem.php  is  not properly verified before
being  used  to  include  files. This can be exploited to
include  arbitrary  files   from   local   resources  via
directory traversal attacks.

Successful exploitation requires that register_globals is
set to On.

The following is the vulnerable code:

<?php

$base_dir = DIR_WS_INCLUDES . 'auto_loaders/';
if (file_exists(DIR_WS_INCLUDES . 'auto_loaders/overrides/' . $loader_file)) {
  $base_dir = DIR_WS_INCLUDES . 'auto_loaders/overrides/';
}

include($base_dir . $loader_file);
