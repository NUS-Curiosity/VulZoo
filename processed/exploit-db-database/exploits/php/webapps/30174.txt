Just For Fun Network Management and Monitoring System (JFFNMS) is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities, including a cross-site scripting issue, an SQL-injection issue, and multiple information-disclosure issues.

An attacker can exploit these issues by manipulating the SQL query logic to carry out unauthorized actions on the underlying database, access sensitive information, and obtain cookie-based authentication credentials.

These issues affect versions prior to JFFNMS 0.8.4-pre3.
