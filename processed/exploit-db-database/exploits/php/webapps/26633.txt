PDJK-support Suite is prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in modification of query logic or other attacks.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

PDJK-support retail version 1.1a is reported to be vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
