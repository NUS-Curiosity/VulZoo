Bitweaver is prone to multiple SQL-injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Bitweaver 1.3.1 and prior versions are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

Since this issue is a duplicate of the the issue described in BID 20988 (Bitweaver Multiple Input Validation Vulnerabilities), this BID is being retired.
