Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple non-persistent cross site web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official uBidAuction v2.0.1 script web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with non-persistent attack vector to compromise browser
to web-application requests from the client-side.

The cross site web vulnerabilities are located in the `date_created`, `date_from`, `date_to` and `created_at` parameters of the `filter` web module.
The injection point is located in the parameters and the execution occurs in the filter module. The request method to inject the malicious script
code is GET and the attack vector of the vulnerability is non-persistent on client-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, non-persistent phishing attacks, non-persistent external redirects
to malicious source and non-persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] ./orders/myOrders
[+] ./auctions/myAuctions/status/active
[+] ./auctions/myAuctions/status/loose
[+] ./posts/manage
[+] ./news/manage
[+] ./tickets/manage
[+] ./auctions/manage
[+] ./backend/mailingLog/manage

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] date_created
[+] date_from
[+] date_to
[+] created_at

Affected Module(s):
[+] Filter


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The client-side cross site scripting web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the cross site web vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be resolved by a filter or secure encode of the vulnerable date_created, date_from, date_to and created_at parameters.
Disallow the usage of special chars in the affected parameters on get method requests.
Sansitize the vulnerable output location to resolve the point of execution in the filter module.
