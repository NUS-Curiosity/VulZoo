Amiro.CMS is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities including multiple cross-site scripting issues, an HTML-injection issue, and an information-disclosure issue.

An attacker may leverage the issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is rendered to the user and disclose sensitive information which may aid in launching further attacks.

Amiro.CMS 5.4.0 is affected; other versions may be vulnerable as well.
