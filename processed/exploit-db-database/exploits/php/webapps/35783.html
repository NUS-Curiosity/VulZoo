Andy's PHP Knowledgebase is prone to a vulnerability that lets remote attackers execute arbitrary code because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary PHP code within the context of the affected webserver process.

Andy's PHP Knowledgebase 0.95.4 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
