It is reported that PHPKIT is susceptible to cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The cross-site scripting issue is present in a parameter of the 'popup.php' script. An attacker can exploit this issue by creating a malicious link containing HTML and script code and send this link to a vulnerable user. This can allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.

An SQL injection issue exists in the application as well. This issue affects a parameter of the 'print.php' script. Due to this, attackers may supply malicious parameters to manipulate the structure and logic of SQL queries.
