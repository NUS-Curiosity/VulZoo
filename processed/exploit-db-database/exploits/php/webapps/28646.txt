MySource products are prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities. Exploiting these issues will allow an attacker to manipulate the application into becoming an HTTP proxy and to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.

An attacker may leverage these issues to cause the application to consume excessive bandwidth and to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

These versions are vulnerable:

- MySource Matrix 3.8 and earlier
- MySource 2.x.
