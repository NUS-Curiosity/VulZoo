# Title: b2ePMS 1.0 multiple SQLi Vulnerabilities
# Version: 1.0
# Author/Found by: loneferret
# Manifacturer/Software link: https://developer.berlios.de/projects/b2epms/
# Other vulnerability: http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/18882/

# Date found: May 27th 2012
# Tested on: Ubuntu Server 8.04 / PHP Version 5.2.4-2ubuntu5.23

# Vulnerability:
# Due to improper input sanitization, pretty much every conceivable parameter is
# SQL injectable. Although to exploit many of these parameters, one needs to be logged
# in, but the main page (index.php) offers a form to send a recipient a message.
# This form does not require authentication.

# Severity:
# Well if anyone actually uses this, I suppose it would be high. But if you're like me
# and just call the person back, you should be safe.

# As always you can have as much fun with this...
# I'm going to be lazy with this one and pretty much show sqlmap's info etc.
