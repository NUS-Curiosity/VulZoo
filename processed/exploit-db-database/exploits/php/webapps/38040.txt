ATutor is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to view files and execute local scripts in the context of the web server process. This may aid in further attacks.

ATutor 2.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
