The 'n8cms' script is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Other attacks are also possible.
