F3Site is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

F3Site 2009 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
