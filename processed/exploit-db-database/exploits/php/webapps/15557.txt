SecPod ID:      1009                            10/20/2010 Issue Discovered


Class:  Local File Inclusion and XSS             Severity: High


Overview:
---------
openEngine is prone to local file inclusion and XSS vulnerabilities.


Technical Description:
----------------------
openEngine is prone to a local file inclusion and XSS vulnerabilities. The
application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Input passed via the 'template' parameter in "cms/website.php" is not properly
verified before it is returned to the user. This can be exploited to obtain
potentially sensitive information and execute arbitrary HTML, script code
in an users browser session in the context of an affected site.

The exploit has been tested on openEngine 2.0 100226


Impact:
--------
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain potentially sensitive
information and execute arbitrary arbitrary HTML, script code in the context
of an affected site.


Affected Software:
------------------
openEngine 2.0 100226; other versions may also be affected.

Proof of Concepts:
------------------
* local file inclusion,
  http://localhost/cms/website.php?template=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

* XSS,
  http://localhost/cms/website.php?template=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
