OpenCms is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an authenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

OpenCms 7.5.0 is affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.
