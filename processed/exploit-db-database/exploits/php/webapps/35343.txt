Smarty Template Engine is prone to a remote PHP code-injection vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate a compromise of the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to Smarty Template Engine 3.0.7 are vulnerable.
