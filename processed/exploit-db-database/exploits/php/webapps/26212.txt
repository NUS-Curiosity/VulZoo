FlatNuke is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An unauthorized user can retrieve arbitrary files by supplying directory traversal strings '../' to the vulnerable parameter.

Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a loss of confidentiality. Information obtained may aid in further attacks against the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.
