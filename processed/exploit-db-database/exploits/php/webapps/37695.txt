Sciretech Multimedia Manager and Sciretech File Manager are prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because they fail to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Sciretech Multimedia Manager 3.0.0 and Sciretech File Manager 3.0.0 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
