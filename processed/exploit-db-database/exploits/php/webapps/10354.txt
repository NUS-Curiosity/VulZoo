POC Info:

A regular user of the board can embed javascript code that could be executed within the context of the admin's browser.
If the user edits their own profile by going to "http://[server]/viscacha/editprofile.php?action=profile"
and places "<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>"
into the instant messenger fields and then gives the following link to the admin:

http://[server]/viscacha/profile.php?action=ims&type=msn&id=1

The user could potentially log the admins cookie and reset their own session thus gaining administration access.
