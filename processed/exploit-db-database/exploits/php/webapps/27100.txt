microBlog is prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
