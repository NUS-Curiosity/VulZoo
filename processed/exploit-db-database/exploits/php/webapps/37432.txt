The Image Gallery Plugin for e107 is prone to a remote file-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to view local files in the context of the web server process, which may aid in further attacks.

Image Gallery 0.9.7.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
