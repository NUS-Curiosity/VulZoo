Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web vulnerabilities in the PBBoard v2.1.4  forum application.

Status:

Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
A persistent web vulnerability is detected in the PBBoard v2.1.4  forum application.
The bug allows remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
The persistent vulnerability is located in the  add poll function when adding a thread. The malicious code can  be injected in the `answer field`.
The output listing page with the pool executed the malicious persistent script code (JS/HTML).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to stable (persistent) context manipulation.
Exploitation requires low user inter-action.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				             [+] Add thread > Add poll

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				             [+] [Answer]


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged
user account & required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

To reproduce the vulnerability, the attacker should add a new thread and the check on the add poll button. After that
the attacker can add his malicious code in the answer field of the poll. Anyone who's viewing that thread will be
exploited  by the malicious code. Such attack can result in session hijacking, redirecting or cookie theft. Moreover,
the persistent XSS can be exploited to launch a CSRF attack to the user and to exploit the other CSRF vulnerabilities
in the same product to completely hack the application.

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities is estimated as medium(+).
