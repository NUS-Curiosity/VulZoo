# I am releasing this to the public. Vendor was notified. Someone is also illegally defacing
these websites under MY name, which is a shame because they ripped it from a private discussion
on g00ns.net. This proof of concept is not to be used to illegally hack websites. I do not condone,
nor act in this type of activity. I suggest whomever is defacing websites under my name stop,
since you would gain more notorioty under your own name.

Use firefox's extension "add n edit cookies" to add these to your cookies so they stick.
(ie: instead of $_GET['loggedin'] its $_COOKIE['loggedin'] which stays with each page)
