GhostScripter Amazon Shop is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

GhostScripter Amazon Shop 5.0.0 and prior versions are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
