Telaen is prone to an open-redirection vulnerability.

An attacker can leverage this issue by constructing a crafted URI and enticing a user to follow it. When an unsuspecting victim follows the link, they may be redirected to an attacker-controlled site; this may aid in phishing attacks. Other attacks are possible.

Versions prior to Telaen 1.3.1 are vulnerable.
