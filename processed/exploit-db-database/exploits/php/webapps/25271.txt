Double Choco Latte is reported prone to multiple vulnerabilities. These issues result from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data and may allow an attacker to carry out cross-site scripting/HTML injection attacks and execute arbitrary PHP code on a computer.

Double Choco Latte 0.9.4.3 is reported vulnerable to the cross-site scripting/HTML injection issue.

Double Choco Latte 0.9.4.2 and prior versions are affected by the PHP code execution issue.

This BID will be updated when more information is available.
