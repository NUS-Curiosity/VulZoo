1. Description

The Roxy File Manager has a configuration setting named FORBIDDEN_UPLOADS,
which keeps a list of forbidden file extensions that the application will
not allow to be uploaded. This configuration setting is also checked when
renaming an existing file to a new file extension.

It is possible to bypass this check and rename already uploaded files to
any extension, using the move function as this function does not perform
any checks.


2. Proof of Concept

The renamed file will now be accessible at http://host/Upload/backdoor.php
