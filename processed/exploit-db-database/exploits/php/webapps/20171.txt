Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Vulnerabilities in Manage Engines Application Manager v10 b10500.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-06-23:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Manage Engine
Product: Application Manager v10.0


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities  are detected  in Manage Engines Application Manager v10 b10500.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms without user inter action. The vulnerabilities are located in the mypage.do or rca.jsp
module(s) and the bound vulnerable parameters selectedpageid & resourceid. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability
results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] MyPage.do
			[+] RCA.jsp

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] selectedpageid
			[+] resourceid


1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in Manage Engines Application Manager v10 b10500.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high
required user inter action or local low privileged user account. The vulnerabilities are located in the showCustom.do, MyPage.do,
ThresholdActionConfiguration.jsp, showresource.do or ProcessTemplates.do files with the bound vulnreable parameters redirectto, &type,
attributeToSelect, templatetype, forpage & monitorname. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing & client-side
content request manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] showCustom.do
			[+] MyPage.do
			[+] ThresholdActionConfiguration.jsp
			[+] showresource.do
			[+] ProcessTemplates.do

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] redirectto
			[+] &type
			[+] attributeToSelect
			[+] templatetype
			[+] forpage
			[+] monitorname


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The blind sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action or privileged user account.

1.2
The non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with medium or high required user inter action.

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the blind sql vulnerabilities are estimated as high.

1.2
The security risk of the non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(-).
