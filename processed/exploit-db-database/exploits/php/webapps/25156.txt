phpMyAdmin is affected by multiple local file include vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to using it in a PHP 'include()', 'require()', 'require-once()', or similar function call.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary server-side script code that resides on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may potentially facilitate unauthorized access.

It should be noted that these issues may also be leveraged to read arbitrary file on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server.
