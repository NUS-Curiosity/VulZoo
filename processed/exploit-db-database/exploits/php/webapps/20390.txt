Introduction:
=============
Joomla is a free and open source content management system (CMS) for publishing content on the World
Wide Web and intranets and a model–view–controller (MVC) Web application framework that can also be
used independently.

Joomla is written in PHP, uses object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques and software design
patterns, stores data in a MySQL database, and includes features such as page caching,
RSS feeds, printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, polls, search, and support for language
internationalization.

Joomla had been downloaded 23 million times. Between March 2007 and February 2011 there had been
more than 21 million downloads. As of November 2011, there are over 8,600 free and commercial
extensions available from the official Joomla! Extension Directory and more available from other sources.
