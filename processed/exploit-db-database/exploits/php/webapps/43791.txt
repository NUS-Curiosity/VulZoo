Plaintext Database Pass Weakness:

Information Disclosure Vulnerability:
By default phpinfo() for the server hosting an Aardvark Topsite can be viewed in the sources directory [ /sources/info.php ] An easy work around for this is quite obvious. If you do not need this file delete it. And if you do need it, then move it to a more secure location :)

Path Disclosure Vulnerability:
There are multiple ways to disclose the full server path on an Aardvark Topsites. Most can be avoided by allowing visitors to the /sources/ directory. However, it is also possible by passing a null or invalid value to the "type" variable when viewing the graph feature.

SQL Injection Vulnerability:
Tampering with SQL queries is possible via the "method" variable in display.php You can test if you are vulnerable by accessing the url below.

http://topsitelocation/index.php?method=`

Also, these are prone to tampering. While it would be hard to exploit, the following should have input validated/sanitized a little better.

http://topsitelocation/index.php?a=lostpw&set=1&id=`
http://topsitelocation/index.php?a=lostpw&set=1&session_id=`

Solution:
Aardvark Industries were very prompt and professional in addressing these issues. You can now download Aardvark Topsites 4.1.1 which has new features along with the obvious security fixes.
