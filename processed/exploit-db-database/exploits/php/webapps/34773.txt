Horde IMP Webmail is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before it is used in dynamic content.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Horde IMP 4.3.7 is affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.
