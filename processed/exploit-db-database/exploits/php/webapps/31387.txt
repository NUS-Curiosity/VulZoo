Uberghey CMS is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to access potentially sensitive information and execute arbitrary local scripts in the context of the affected application.

Uberghey CMS 0.3.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
