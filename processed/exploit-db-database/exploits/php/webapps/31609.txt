Nuke ET is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data. Attackers will likely require access to a user account to perform attacks.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to execute HTML and script code in the context of the affected site, to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Nuke ET 3.4 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
