Portili Personal and Team Wiki are prone to multiple security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include a cross-site scripting vulnerability, an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability, and multiple information-disclosure vulnerabilities.

Attackers can exploit these issues to obtain sensitive information, steal cookie-based authentication information, upload arbitrary files to the affected computer, and execute arbitrary script code in the context of the browser.

Personal Wiki 1.14 and Team Wiki 1.14 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
