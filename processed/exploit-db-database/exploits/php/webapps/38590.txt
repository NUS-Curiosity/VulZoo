et-chat is prone to a privilege-escalation vulnerability and an arbitrary shell-upload vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit these issues to gain elevated privileges within the application and upload arbitrary shells; this can result in an arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable application.

et-chat 3.07 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
