velBox is prone to an authentication-bypass vulnerability because it fails to adequately verify user-supplied input used for cookie-based authentication.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrative access to the affected application, which may aid in further attacks.

velBox 1.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.


The following example data is available:
