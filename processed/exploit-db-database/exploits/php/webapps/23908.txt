It has been reported that OpenBB is prone to a vulnerability that may allow malicious users to influence SQL queries of the affected application. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI data.

This may allow a remote attacker to manipulate query logic, potentially leading to access to sensitive information such as the administrator password hash or corruption of database data. SQL injection attacks may also potentially be used to exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
