PHP Website is a web site content management system that allows for easy maintainance and administration of interactive community-driven websites.

Cross-site vulnerabilities have been reported in the Calendar, PageMaster, Search and Fatcat modules that allow an attacker to create a link containing malicious script code that may be rendered in a user's browser when the link is followed.

This would occur in the security context of the site running PHP Website.
