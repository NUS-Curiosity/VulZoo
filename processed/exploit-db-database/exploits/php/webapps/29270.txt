The mxBB profile Control Panel module is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer in the context of the webserver process.

mxBB Profile Control Panel Module version 0.91c is vulnerable to this issue.
