Class:  Persistent Cross-Site Scripting         Severity: High


Overview:
---------
Micro CMS is prone to Persistent Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability.

Technical Description:
----------------------
Micro CMS is prone to a Persistent Cross-Site vulnerability because it fails to
properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Input passed via the 'name' parameter(also in text-area) in a comment section
to "comments/send/" is not properly verified before it is returned to the
user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
user's browser session in the context of a vulnerable site. This may allow
the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication and to launch further attacks.

The exploit has been tested in Micro CMS 1.0 beta 1


Impact:
--------
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script
code in a user's browser session in the context of a vulnerable site.


Affected Software:
------------------
Micro CMS 1.0 beta 1 and prior

Proof of Concepts:
------------------
Add the following attack strings:
  1. My XSS Test </legend><script> alert('XSS-Test')</script> <!--

  OR

  2. My XSS Test </legend><script> alert('XSS-Test')</script>

  OR

  3. <script> alert('XSS-Test')</script>

  in "* Name" textbox in comment section and fill other sections properly.

NOTE :  Some time above POC/Exploit will disable adding comments for that post.
