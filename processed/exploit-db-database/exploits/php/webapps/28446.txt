HLstats is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may help an attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Version 1.34 is reported vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
