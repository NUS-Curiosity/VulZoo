ClanSphere is prone to a local file-include vulnerability and multiple arbitrary-file-upload vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit these issues to upload arbitrary files onto the webserver, execute arbitrary local files within the context of the webserver, and obtain sensitive information.

ClanSphere 2011.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
