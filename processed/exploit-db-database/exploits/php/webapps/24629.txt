Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in CosCms, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary OS commands on web server where the vulnerable application is hosted.


1) OS Command Injection in CosCms: CVE-2013-1668

Vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in "$_FILES['file']['name']" variable passed to "/gallery/upload/index" URL before using it in PHP "exec()" function. A remote attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request containing a malicious filename, and execute arbitrary commands on the target system with privileges of the web server.

The following PoC (Proof of Concept) code will write output of "ls -la" command into "/gallery/upload/file.txt" file. You can use any tool to send raw HTTP requests, e.g. telnet:



POST /gallery/upload/index HTTP/1.1
