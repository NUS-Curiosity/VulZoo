It has been reported that an input validation error exists in the 'viewforum.php' script included with PHPNuke as part of the Forum module. Because of this, an attacker could send a malicious string through PHPNuke that would allow the attacker to inject SQL commands and queries into the SQL database used by PHPNuke.
