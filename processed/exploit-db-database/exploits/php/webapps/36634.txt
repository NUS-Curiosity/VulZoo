The 'com_visa' component for Joomla! is prone to a local file-include vulnerability and multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit the local file-include vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to view and execute arbitrary local files within the context of the affected application. Information harvested may aid in further attacks.

The attacker can exploit the SQL-injection vulnerabilities to compromise the application, access or modify data, exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database, or bypass the authentication control.
