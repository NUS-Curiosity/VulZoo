# Exploit Title: Joomla! JFilterInput XSS Bypass
# Date: 1 February 2011

# Version: 1.5.22, 1.6.0
# Tested on: PHP5, MySQL5

Joomla! 1.5 and 1.6 rely on the JFilterInput class to sanitize
user-supplied html. This class attempts to parse any given string for
html code, checks the code against a whitelist of elements and
attributes, and strips out any code that is not allowed. However,
malformed html code can be used to bypass the filter and inject XSS code
into user-supplied input.

The following string bypasses JFilterInput's "safe" attributes in both
1.5 and 1.6:

<img src="<img src=x"/onerror=alert(1)//">

Users of 1.6 can test this by enabling the "Profile" user plugin and
injecting this string into the "About Me" textarea. Joomla! 1.5 has no
known core extensions that allow guests or regular users to post html,
however any 3rd party extension that relies on this class to sanitize
input will be vulnerable.
