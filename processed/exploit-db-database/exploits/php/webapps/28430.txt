Jupiter CMS is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to include arbitrary remote files containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and to gain access to the underlying system.

Version 1.1.5 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
