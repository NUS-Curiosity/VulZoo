WebCalendar is affected by an SQL injection vulnerability. This issue exists because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

This vulnerability is reported to affect WebCalendar 0.9.45; earlier versions may also be affected.

The vendor has addressed this issue in WebCalendar 1.0RC1 and later.

<?php
include_once 'includes/init.php';
echo encode_string("'; drop table foo; select 'a|zzabcdefg");
