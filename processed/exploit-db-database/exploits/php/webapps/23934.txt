Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been reported in AzDGDatingLite. These issues may be exploited by enticing a victim user to visit a malicious link that includes hostile HTML and script code.

Exploitation could facilitate theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

This issue was reported in AzDGDatingLite 2.1.1. It is not known if earlier versions or commercial releases which share the same code base are affected, such as AzDGDatingPlatinum or AzDGDatingGold.
