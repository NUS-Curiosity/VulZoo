Maian Weblog is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

This will allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL logic into the vulnerable parameters and scripts. As a result, the attacker may be able to access or modify sensitive information, compromise the application, or even compromise the underlying database. Other attacks are possible.
