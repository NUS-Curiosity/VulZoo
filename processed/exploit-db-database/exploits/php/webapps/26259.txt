Noah's Classifieds is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability. This is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
