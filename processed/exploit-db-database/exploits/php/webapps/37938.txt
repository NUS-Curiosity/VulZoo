OpenX is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

OpenX 2.8.10 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
