Atom PhotoBlog is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input data before rendering it in a user's browser. These issues include multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities and a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Attackers could exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users of the site; other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to Atom PhotoBlog 1.0.9.1 are vulnerable.
