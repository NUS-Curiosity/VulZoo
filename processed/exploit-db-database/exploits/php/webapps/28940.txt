phpMyChat is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue may allow an unauthorized user to view files and execute local scripts.

phpMyChat 0.15.0 and prior versions are vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
