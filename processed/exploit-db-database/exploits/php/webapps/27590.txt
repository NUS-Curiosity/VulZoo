APT-webshop is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

APT-webshop 3.0 light, 3.0 basic, and 4.0 pro are reported prone to these issues. Other versions may be vulnerable as well.
