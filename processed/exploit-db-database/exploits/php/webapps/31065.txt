F5 BIG-IP Application Security Manager is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the web management interface fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected device. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

This issue affects F5 BIG-IP Application Security Manager 9.4.3; other versions may also be vulnerable.
