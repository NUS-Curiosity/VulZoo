Chipmunk CMS is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject html and script code into the Web browser of an unsuspecting victim. The attacker may then steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.
