Symphony is prone to a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit the cross-site request forgery issue to perform unauthorized actions in the context of a logged-in user of the affected application. This may aid in other attacks.

Symphony version 2.3.1 and prior are vulnerable.
