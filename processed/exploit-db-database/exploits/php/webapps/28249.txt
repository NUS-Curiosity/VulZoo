GeodesicSolutions products are prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the applications fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful attack could allow an attacker to compromise the software, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Note that these vulnerabilities occur only when the 'accumulative feedback' feature is turned on.
