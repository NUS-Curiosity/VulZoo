PowerPortal is reported vulnerable to remote SQL injection. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly validate user-supplied input prior to including it in an SQL query.

PowerPortal 1.3 is reported prone to this vulnerability, however, it is possible that other versions are affected as well.
