Vulnerability exists for the reason that direct access to some files, around logicians of work of the appendix is possible.
It gives the chance to redefine internal variables which are transferred as arguments in function include ().
Examples of vulnerable files:

etc

The note:
For vulnerability operation the following options PHP are required: register_globals=On and magic_quotes_gpc=Off

2. Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

Examples of vulnerable files:
SQL Injection (insert) -
 /index.php?page='SQL
SQL Injection (delete) -
 /index.php?page=processforms&ok=1&SP=1&form_id=2
 , where "form_id" the identifier of the deleted user

etc

The note:
