MySpace Scripts Poll Creator is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.
