..::[ Descriprion ]::..

You might already have heard of logahead - the ajaxified blogging engine using PHP4 and mySQL database by James from the UK.
The UNU edition is based on the logahead beta 1.0 code published under GNU/GPL license. While the original version sticks to
the basic functions of a blog (mainly publishing posts and receiving comments), the UNU edition is more enchanted and offers
a number of additional features.


..::[ Bug ]::..

My give searches the form Widgets of this blog is results vulnerability, in fact
a remote attaker is able to upload also a file php, and to perform arbitrary commands
inside the server victim.
