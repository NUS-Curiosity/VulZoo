'''
Proof of concepts for the base attacks against the Bitbot panel.
By: Brian Wallace (bwall) @botnet_hunter

You can test these against the Vulnerable Virtual Machine challenge featuring
Bitbot at https://sourceforge.net/p/flippingbitbot/wiki/Home/ and
read details about more elaborate attacks against Bitbot at
http://cylance.com/techblog/A-Study-in-Bots-Bitbot.shtml

"drop" - Sets the command on all the bots to uninstall themselves, a modified
version could be used to get the bots to download and execute a file.

"xss" - Injects a fake bot which causes a persistent XSS in the bot panel, this
attack can be used to get information about the botter, or used to change
configuration values, such as which mining pool the bots are sending to.  There
is very limited room for the XSS.  Since very few of the values go through any
sanitization, it would be possible to implement the attack across multiple
parameters.

"dos" - While this attack implements a denial of service attack, it also shows
a simpler SQLi vulnerability than the one used to inject commands into the
bots.  This one could be used to potentially dump the database, write a web
shell and read files from the host.  I'll leave that to your imagination.  The
implemented attack will DoS the MySQL server, and if repeated, eventually it
can DoS the Apache server if a max instance count is set (default configuration
will take only 150 to lock bots/botters out of Apache).  The current version is a
blocking call.
