OVE ID

OVE-20160719-0003

Tested versions

This issue was successfully tested on 404 to 301 WordPress Plugin version 2.2.8.

Fix

This issue is resolved in 404 to 301 WordPress Plugin version 2.3.1.

Introduction

The 404 to 301 WordPress Plugin automatically redirects, logs and notifies all 404 page errors to any page using 301 redirect for SEO. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability exists in the 404-to-301 WordPress plugin.

Details

The vulnerability exists in the file admin/class-404-to-301-logs.php, which fails to correctly escape user-controlled strings which are output in HTML tables containing logs shown to site administrators, such as the Referer (ref) and User-Agent (ua) fields.

In order to exploit this issue, after an attack attempt has been made, an administrator must view the logs (via the WordPress administration console) provided by the plugin, by clicking '404 Error Logs'.

Proof of concept

Submit an HTTP request to a non-existent URL (to trigger the 404 handler) containing a header such as one of the following:

Referer: "<iframe src=/></iframe>
User-Agent: "<script>alert(/hi/);</script>
