aBitWhizzy is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and directory-traversal vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to view the directory structure on the affected webserver and perform cross-site scripting attacks on unsuspecting users in the context of the affected website. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
