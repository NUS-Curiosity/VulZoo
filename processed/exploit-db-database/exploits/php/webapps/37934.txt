The Shopp plugin for WordPress is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit these issues to disclose sensitive information, steal cookie information, execute arbitrary client side script code in the context of browser, upload and execute arbitrary files in the context of the web server, and launch other attacks.

Shopp 1.0.17 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
