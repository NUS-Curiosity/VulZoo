Sitemax Maestro is prone to SQL-injection and local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application, access or modify data, exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database, use directory-traversal strings to execute local script code in the context of the application, or obtain sensitive information that may aid in further attacks.

Sitemax Maestro 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
