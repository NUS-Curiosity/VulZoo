phpMyQuote is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including a cross-site scripting issue and an SQL-injection issue, because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, execute malicious script code in a user's browser, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

These issues affect phpMyQuote 0.20; other versions may also be vulnerable.
