SiteBar is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

These issues include:

- A local file-include vulnerability
- Multiple arbitrary-script-code-execution vulnerabilities
- Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
- A URI-redirection vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues can allow attackers to access potentially sensitive information, to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the webserver process, to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and to redirect users to malicious webpages.

SiteBar 3.3.8 and prior versions are vulnerable.
