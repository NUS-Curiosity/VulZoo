WordPress is prone to a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability because it does not properly validate HTTP requests.

Exploiting this issue may allow a remote attacker to perform certain unauthorized actions in the context of the affected application. Other attacks are also possible.

WordPress 2.0.11 is vulnerable.
