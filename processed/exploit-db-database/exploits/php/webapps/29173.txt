Active PHP Bookmarks application is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Version 1.1.02 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.

This BID is being retired because further analysis reveals that the application is not vulnerable.
