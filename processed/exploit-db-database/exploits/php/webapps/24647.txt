It is reported that ParaChat is susceptible to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input data.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to retrieve the contents of arbitrary, potentially sensitive files located on the serving computer with the credentials of the ParaChat server process.

Version 5.5 is reported susceptible to this vulnerability. Other versions may also be affected.
