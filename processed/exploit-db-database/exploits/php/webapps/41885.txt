Vendor:
==================
www.concrete5.org



Product:
================
concrete5 v8.1.0

concrete5 is an open-source content management system (CMS) for publishing content on the World Wide Web and intranets.


Vulnerability Type:
======================
Host Header Injection



CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-7725



Security Issue:
================
If a user does not specify a "canonical" URL on installation of concrete5, unauthenticated remote attackers can write to the
"collectionversionblocksoutputcache" table of the MySQL Database, by making HTTP GET request with a poisoned HOST header.
Some affected concrete5 webpages can then potentially render arbitrary links that can point to a malicious website.

Example MySQL data from "CollectionVersionBlocksOutputCache" table.
