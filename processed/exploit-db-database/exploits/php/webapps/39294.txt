Spider Video Player extension for Joomla! is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

An attacker may leverage this issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Spider Video Player Extension 2.8.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
