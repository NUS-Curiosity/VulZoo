XMB Forum has been reported prone to multiple cross-site scripting, HTML injection and SQL injection vulnerabilities. The issues present themselves due to insufficient sanitization of remote user supplied data. An attacker may exploit any one of these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user or to have malicious SQL queries executed in the underlying database.
