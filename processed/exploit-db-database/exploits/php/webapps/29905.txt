B2 is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

These issues affect B2 0.6.1; other versions may also be vulnerable.
