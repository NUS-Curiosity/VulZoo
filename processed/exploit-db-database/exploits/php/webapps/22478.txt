It has been reported that user-supplied input to phPay is not sufficiently sanitized. This lack of sanitization provides an opportunity for an attacker to launch cross-site scripting attacks.

It is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user.

Any attacker-supplied code will be executed within the context of the website running phPay.

While this vulnerability has been reported to affect phPay version 2.02, previous versions may also be affected.
