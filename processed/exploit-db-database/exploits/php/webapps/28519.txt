WM-News is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Version 0.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
