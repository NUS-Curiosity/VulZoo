Yappa (Yet Another PHP Photo Album) is prone to multiple remote command-execution vulnerabilities because it fails to properly validate user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the vulnerable system.

Yappa 3.1.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
