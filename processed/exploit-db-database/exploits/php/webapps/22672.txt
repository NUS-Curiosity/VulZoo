A remote file include vulnerability has been reported for Cafelog. Due to insufficient sanitization of some user-supplied variables by the 'blogger-2-b2.php' and 'gm-2-b2.php' scripts, it is possible for a remote attacker to include a malicious PHP file in a URL.

If the remote file is a malicious PHP script, this may allow for execution of attacker-supplied PHP code with the privileges of the web server.
