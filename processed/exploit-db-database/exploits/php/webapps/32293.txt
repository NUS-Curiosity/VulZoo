One-News is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including an SQL-injection issue and multiple HTML-injection issues. The vulnerabilities occur because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is rendered to the user, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Beta 2 of One-News is prone to these issues.
