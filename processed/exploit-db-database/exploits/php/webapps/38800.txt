FreeSMS is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database; other attacks are also possible.

FreeSMS 2.1.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
