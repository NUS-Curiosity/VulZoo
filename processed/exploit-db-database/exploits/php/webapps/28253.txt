Advanced Poll is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the application.

An attacker may leverage this issue to have an arbitrary remote file containing malicious script code execute in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system. Other attacks are also possible.

Version 2.02 is reported vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
