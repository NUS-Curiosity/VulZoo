Affected Products:
==================
BlueWin CH
Product: Wolf CMS v0.7.5


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
A SQL Injection vulnerability is detected on the Wolfs Content Management
System v0.7.5. The
vulnerability allows an remote attacker to execute own sql commands on the
affected application
dbms. Successful exploitation can result in dbms, web-server or application
compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] /plugins/comment/[Index]

1.2
Multiple persistent vulnerabilities are detected on the Wolfs Content
Management System v0.7.5.
The bug allows an remote attacker or local low privileged user account to
inject persistent malicious
script code on application side. Successful exploitation can result in
persistent context manipulation
on requests, session hijacking & account steal via application side
phishing.

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] /plugins/comment/

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers & local low
privileged user accounts with- and
without required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1
Path: /wolfcms/wolf/plugins/comment/
File: index.php

Review:
271: $ip = isset($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']) ?
$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']:($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']);


1.2
Path: /wolfcms/wolf/plugins/comment/
File: index.php

Review:
/wolfcms/wolf/plugins/comment/index.php
272: echo '<input type="hidden" value="'.$ip.'" name="comment[author_ip]"
/>';


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the blind sql injection vulnerabilities are estimated
as high(+).

1.2
The security risk of the persistant xss vulnerabilities are estimated as
medium(+).
