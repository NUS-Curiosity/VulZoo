Introduction:
=============
Havalite, a lightweight, open source CMS, based on php and SQLite. It\\\\\\\'s licensed under the GNU General Public
License.

- A Mobile Detector to switch in Mobile mode
- Simple 1 step wizard installation
- Text, Images and swf files all saved as data in Sqlite Database
- Two different image sizes: Original and Thumnail
- Backup for the whole system including images in only one Sqlite file. SqLite3 and above allows storing Blobs and a
better Utf-8 performance
- Export database to any Server without changing a single line or database structure.
- A lite weight and clear interface
- Many Interface languages done on the fly with our language Creator Tool
- FCKEditor a great WYSIWYG Text-Editor
- integration of third-party Plugins, specially jQuery, with the ability of plugin configuration
- plenty of useful functions for Theme creation + Theme Preview, and Plugins Creation
- RSS Feeds for Posts, Categories and Comments

Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in Havalite CMS v1.0.4.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-23:     Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in Havalite v1.0.4 Content Management System.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent)
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action because the admin needs to watch the user list.
The user includes his scriptcode as profile name and the code is getting executed on the administrator section
persistent.


Vulnerable Module(s):
                                [+] findReplace - Input/Output Listing
                                [+] Username Profile Input & Username Login or Input Message Miscellaneous [postAuthor]

                                ../2.png


1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in Havalite v1.0.4 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with high required
user inter action or local low privileged user account. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, phishing
& client-side content request manipulation.


Vulnerable Module(s):
                                [+] postID
                                [+] userID
                                [+] linkID

Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with low or medium required
user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Review: findReplace - Replace

<td id="catSplitter" valign="top" width="350"><form id="form1" name="form1" method="post" action="">
Find:
<input name="find" id="find" style="width: 100%;" type="text">
<iframe src="findReplace.php-Dateien/a.htm" onload="alert(document.cookie)" <"="">
Replace:
<input name="replace" type="text" id="replace" style="width:100%;"
value=""><iframe src=a onload=alert(document.cookie) <" />
<span style="display:block; text-align:right; padding:10px 0;">
<label><input name="findOpt" type="radio" value="find"
checked="checked" />
Find only</label>
<label><input name="findOpt" type="radio" value="replace"
/>Find and Replace</label>
</span>
<span style="display:block; text-align:right; padding:10px 0;">
<input type="submit" name="Submit" value="    Replace in all posts

</span>
</form>

Review: Login Username Form & Edit Article Module

<tr>
<td id="log_text">Username</td>
<td><input name="username" id="username" type="text">
<iframe src="hava_login.php-Dateien/a.htm" onload='alert("Vulnerabilitylab")' <"="" autofocus="autofocus"></td>

URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/havalite/hava_login.php

... or via miscellaneous module postAuthor

<input name="postAuthor" type="text" id="postAuthor" value="admin">
Date: <input name="postDate" type="text" id="postDate" value="11-10-14 15:42:40" />

URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/havalite/hava_post.php?postId=1


1.2
The client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attacker with medium or high required
user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).

1.2
The security risk of the client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as low(+).
