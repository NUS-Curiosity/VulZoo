ProjectBB is reportedly affected by multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

As a result of these vulnerabilities, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user when followed. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.
