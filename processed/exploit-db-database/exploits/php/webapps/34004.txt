Multiple Percha components for Joomla are prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because they fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to obtain potentially sensitive information and execute arbitrary local scripts in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

The following Percha components are affected:

com_perchaimageattach
com_perchafieldsattach
com_perchadownloadsattach
com_perchagallery
com_perchacategoriestree
