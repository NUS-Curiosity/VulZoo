PacerCMS is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

These issues affect versions prior to PacerCMS 0.6.1.

NOTE: To exploit these issues, the attacker may require 'staff member' access.
