=====================
Vulnerability Details
=====================

The 'message' field doesn't sanitize input, allowing a less privileged user (Editor, Author, etc.)
to execute an XSS attack against an Administrator.

Proof of Concept:

Place <script>alert('Hello!')</script> in the message field of a private message and then submit.

Open the message and the alert window will fire.
