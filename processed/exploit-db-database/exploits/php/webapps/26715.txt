Widget Press Widget Property is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability.

This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'property.php' script before using it in an SQL query.

This vulnerability could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in modification of query logic or other attacks.

Widget Property 1.1.19 is reportedly vulnerable. Other versions may be affected as well.
