phpProfiles is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute malicious code within the context of the web server process, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

phpProfiles 4.5.4 Beta is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
