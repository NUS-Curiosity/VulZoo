Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple persistent input validation web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official Hotel Listing v3.x wordpress plugin web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to compromise browser to
web-application requests from the application-side.

The vulnerabilities are located in add new listing - address, city, zipcode, country and location input fields of the my-account module.
Remote attackers can register a low privileged application user account to inject own malicious script codes with persistent attack vector to
hijack user/admin session credentials or to permanently manipulate affected modules. The execute of the malicious injected script code takes
place in the frontend on preview but as well in the backend on interaction to edit or list (?&profile=all-post) by administrative accounts.
The request method to inject is post and the attack vector is persistent located on the application-side.

[+] address
[+] city
[+] zipcode
[+] country

Affected Module(s):
[+] Frontend on Preview (All Listings)
[+] Backend on Preview (All Listings) or Edit


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent web vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with privilged user accounts with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1. Encode and parse all vulnerable input fields on transmit via post method request
2. Restrict the input fields to disallow usage of special chars
3. Encode and escape the output content in the edit and list itself to prevent the execution point


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability in the hotel listing application is estimated as medium.
