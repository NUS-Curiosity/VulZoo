PoC:

The conferencing component on Mitel ShoreTel 19.46.1802.0 devices could
allow an unauthenticated attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site
scripting attack (XSS) via the PATH_INFO to index.php, due to insufficient
validation for the time_zone object in the HOME_MEETING& page.

Vulnerable payload
/index.php/%22%20onmouseover=alert(document.domain)%20?page=HOME

Vulnerability is in the HOME_MEETINGS& page, where a time_zone dropdown
object is located. Upon executing the payload, the exploit executes when
the mouse is rolled over the dropdown menu object.
