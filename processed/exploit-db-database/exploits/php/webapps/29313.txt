Xt-News is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting and SQL-injection issues, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker could exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Version 0.1 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
