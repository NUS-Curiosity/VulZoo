The Email Newsletter plugin for WordPress is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied data.

An attackers can exploit this issue to obtain sensitive information that may aid in further attacks.

Email Newsletter 8.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
