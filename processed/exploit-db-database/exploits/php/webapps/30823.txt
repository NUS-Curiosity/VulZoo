The 'bcoos' program is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including SQL-injection issues and cross-site scripting issues, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

These issues affect the application's arcade, myalbum, mylinks, and ecal modules.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

These issues affect bcoos 1.0.10; other versions may also be affected.
