"Profile Wii Friend Code" MyBB plugin is vulnerable to SQL UPDATE Injection and Persistent XSS.

The vulnerable code lies here(in profilewfc.php):

<?php
function profilewfc_update($wfc)
{
  global $mybb;

  if (isset($mybb->input['wfc']))
   {
      $wfc->user_update_data['wfc'] = $mybb->input['wfc'];
   }
}
?>

As you can see the input is not sanitized in the least...

Persistent XSS:
1. Go to your user cp and edit your profile - usercp.php?action=profile
2. and at the "Wii Friend Code Wii Friend Code" box enter: <script>alert(1)</script> and then press submit
3. http://prntscr.com/o1x2p, submit, and http://prntscr.com/o1x69

SQL Injection:
1. Go to your user cp and edit your profile - usercp.php?action=profile
2. Enter this into the Wii Friend Code field as you would do with the 1st vulnerability: x', usergroup='4
3. submit and now you belong to whatever usergroup to choice to belong to
