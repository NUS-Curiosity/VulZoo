VICIDIAL Call Center Suite is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

VICIDIAL Call Center Suite 2.2.1-237 and prior are vulnerable.
