TorrentFlux is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the affected application. Information obtained may aid attackers in further attacks.

TorrentFlux 2.1 is reported vulnerable; other versions may be affected as well.
