Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered multiple vulnerabilities in X2CRM, which can be exploited to include arbitrary local files and execute arbitrary PHP code, as well as to perform Cross-Site Sripting (XSS) attacks against users of vulnerable application.

1) PHP File Inclusion in X2CRM: CVE-2013-5692

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of the "file" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/index.php/admin/translationManager" URL before using it in PHP "include()" function. A remote authenticated administrator can include and execute arbitrary local PHP files on the target system using directory traversal sequences.

The following exploitation example displays content of "/etc/passwd" file:

http://[host]/index.php/admin/translationManager?file=../../../../../etc
/passwd

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires administrative privileges, however it can be also exploited via CSRF vector to which the application is prone.

Simple CSRF exploit below includes and executes "/tmp/file.php" script:

<img src="http://[host]/index.php/admin/translationManager?file=../../../../.
./tmp/file.php">

2) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in X2CRM: CVE-2013-5693

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data in "model" HTTP GET parameter passed to "/index.php/admin/editor" URL. A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

The exploitation example below uses JavaScript "alert()" function to display administrator's cookies:

http://[host]/index.php/admin/editor?model=%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealer
t%28document.cookie%29;%3C/script%3E
