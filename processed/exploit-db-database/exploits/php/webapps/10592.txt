The PoC:

1.- Preview

This web APP is Vulnerable to xss in its instalation file but you can
misconfigurate all the
code with this bug also, you must see to understand...


2.- Vulnerable Code

function database_setup(){


   if( isset($_POST['form_data']) ){

  $host = (string) $_POST['DATABASE_HOST'];

     $user = (string) $_POST['DATABASE_USER'];

     $pass = (string) $_POST['DATABASE_PASSWORD'];

     $tabl = (string) $_POST['DATABASE_TABLESPACE'];

    $prefix = (string) $_POST['DATABASE_TABLE_PREFIX'];





3.- Expl0tation
First Bug its where you just post data without nothing in security so
you can put in the
host textbox on the install.php?step=2 ">
in which usually
is written localhost and in other .php files (install.php) they show
$host so the Xss its
notable...


4.- More Vuln Code...


     $this->set_conf_property('DATABASE_HOST', $host);


you may think theres no problem with this step but...
if you write the DATABSE_HOST with host being explotated it could
be...interesting...


5.- MORE

define('DATABASE_HOST', 'localhost');


This is the execelent example to show you how it can work like a PHP DROP...

just put something like "> in the
DATABASE_HOST textbox

and excecute, just refresh and...
