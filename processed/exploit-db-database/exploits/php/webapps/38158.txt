The WordPress Shopping Cart plugin for WordPress is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and an arbitrary file-upload vulnerability because it fails to sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to compromise the application, execute arbitrary code, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

WordPress Shopping Cart 8.1.14 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
