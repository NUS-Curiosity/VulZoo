2. Overview

Lepton is a content management system written in PHP. In version 2.2.2, it is
vulnerable to code execution as it is possible to upload files with dangerous
type via the media manager.

3. Details

Upload of file with dangerous type

CVSS: High 9.0 AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C

well as a server-side extension check. The server-side check can be bypassed by
including a valid extension before the desired extension, leading to code
execution or XSS.
