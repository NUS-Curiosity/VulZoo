php MBB is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

php MBB 0.0.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
