SQLBuddy provides a web based mysql administration and it's included in
packages like wamp server.

SQL Buddy suffers from a remote code execution. This happens due to the
fact that it allows the user to login using any server he wants and that it
allows the user to export data from the database to a file on the webserver.

In order to exploit this bug do the following steps:

1- Use a sql server you control and have a valid credentials for (You can
use one of the free mysql hosting services).
2- Create a database and a table with one column of type text.
3- Insert the php code you want to execute into that table.
4- Choose the previously created table from the left menu.
5- Click Export from the top menu.
6- Choose CSV format.
7- Choose "Text File" and name the file with php extension for example
shell.php.

The exported file will be at : sqlbuddy/exports/ assuming you installed
sqlbuddy in a folder named sqlbuddy.
