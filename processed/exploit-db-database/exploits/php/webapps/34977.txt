The jRSS Widget Plugin for WordPress is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to view local files in the context of the affected application. This may allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information; other attacks are also possible.

jRSS Widget 1.1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
