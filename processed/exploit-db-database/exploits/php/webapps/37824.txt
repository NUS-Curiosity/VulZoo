1. Product Description
Extract from the plugin page :
"WP Symposium turns a WordPress website into a Social Network! It is a WordPress plugin that provides a forum, activity (similar to Facebook wall), member directory, private mail, notification panel, chat windows, profile page, social widgets, activity alerts, RSS activity feeds, Groups, Events, Gallery, Facebook Connect and Mobile support! You simply choose which you want to activate! Certain features are optional to members to protect their privacy."

2. Vulnerability Description & Technical Details
Wordpress plugin wp-symposium version 15.5.1 (and probably all existing previous versions) suffers from an unauthenticated SQL Injection in get_album_item.php parameter 'size'.
The issue is exploitable even if the plugin is deactivated.

3. Impact Analysis :

The SQL injection allows (very easily) to retrieve all the database content, which includes users details and password hashes. An attacker may be able to crack users' password hashes and log in as them. If an administrator user password is obtained, then the attacker could take complete control of the Wordpress installation. Collected information may also allow further attacks.

5. Proof of Concept

PoC URL : http://localhost/<WP-path>/wp-content/plugins/wp-symposium/get_album_item.php?size=version%28%29%20;%20--
PoC Command (Unix) : wget "http://localhost/<WP-path>/wp-content/plugins/wp-symposium/get_album_item.php?size=version%28%29%20;%20--" -O output.txt

In the content of the HTTP response you will find the MySQL version, for example :
5.5.44-0+deb7u1
