Browser CRM is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Browser CRM 5.100.01 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
