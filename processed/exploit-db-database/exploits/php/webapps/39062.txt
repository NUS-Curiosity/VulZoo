ZenPhoto is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and multiple path-disclosure vulnerabilities.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database. The attacker may gain access to potentially sensitive information that can aid in other attacks.

ZenPhoto 1.4.4 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
