UBB.threads is prone to multiple file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data. Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

UBB.threads 7.5.4.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

POC:
An attacker can exploit these issues via a browser.
