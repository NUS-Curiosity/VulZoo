CMS Balitbang is prone to HTML-injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits will allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

CMS Balitbang 3.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
