#About Plugin
The plugin additionally allows the mime types and file extensions to WordPress. In other words, your WordPress site can upload various file extensions.
#Vulnerable Description

Share this malicious link to the plugin user. Once he clicks the link, the mime type will automatically get updated. Here I shared a POC to allow exe files(application/x-msdownload) to be uploaded.
