HotPlug CMS is prone to a cross-site scripting attack. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the browser of a victim user in the context of the webserver process. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials or launch other attacks.
