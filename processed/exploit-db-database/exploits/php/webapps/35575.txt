PrestaShop is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

PrestaShop 1.3.6 and prior are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
