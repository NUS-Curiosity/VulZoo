AdvertisementManager is prone to local and remote file-include vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information or compromise the application and the underlying computer; other attacks are also possible.

AdvertisementManager 3.1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
