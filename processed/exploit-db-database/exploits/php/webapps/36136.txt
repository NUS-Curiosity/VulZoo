StarDevelop LiveHelp is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain potentially sensitive information and to execute arbitrary local scripts in the context of the Web server process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

StarDevelop LiveHelp 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
