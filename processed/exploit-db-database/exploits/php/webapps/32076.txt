Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered vulnerability in Ilch CMS, which can be exploited to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against users and administrators of vulnerable application.

1) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Ilch CMS: CVE-2014-1944

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitisation of user-supplied data in "text" HTTP POST parameter passed to "/index.php/guestbook/index/newentry" URL. A remote unauthenticated user can send a specially crafted HTTP POST request, which allows to permanently inject and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in userâ??s browser in context of the vulnerable website when the victim visits the "http://[host]/index.php/guestbook/index/index" URL.

The exploitation example below uses the JavaScript "alert()" function to display "immuniweb" word:

POST /index.php/guestbook/index/newentry HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 151

ilch_token=5a528778359d4756b9b8803b48fba18b&name=name&email=email%40emai
l.com&homepage=http%3A%2F%2Fsite.com&text=<script>alert('immuniwweb');</
script>&saveEntry=Submit

Fixed by vendor on February 18, 2014 directly in the source code without version modification/new release. Update to the version 2.0 released after February 18, 2014.
