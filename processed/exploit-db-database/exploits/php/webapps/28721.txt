Red Mombin is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may let the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Red Mombin version 0.7 is vulnerable to these issues.
