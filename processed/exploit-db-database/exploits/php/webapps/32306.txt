dotProject is prone to multiple SQL-injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Attackers may exploit the SQL-injection issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

dotProject 2.1.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
