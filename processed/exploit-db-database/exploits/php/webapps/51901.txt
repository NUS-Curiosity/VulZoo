# Exploit Author: Saeed reza Zamanian
# Software Link: https://get.typo3.org/release-notes/11.5.24

 In TYPO3 11.5.24, the filelist component allows attackers (with access to the administrator panel),
 to read arbitrary files by utilizing a directory traversal via the baseuri field, This is demonstrated through :
 POST /typo3/record/edit with ../../../ and the parameter
  data[sys_file_storage]*[data][sDEF][lDEF][basePath][vDEF].

-----------------------------------------------------
To exploit this vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the administrator panel.
2. Navigate to 'file' > 'Filelist' section.
3. Right-click on a file storage and select 'New.'
4. Set the base URI to "../../../" and save.

After creating the file storage, the final HTTP request should resemble the one below. Once the file storage is created, refresh the page, enabling you to browse any directory on the server.

To access "/etc/passwd," browse to the '/etc/' directory, search for 'passwd,' and view the file.
