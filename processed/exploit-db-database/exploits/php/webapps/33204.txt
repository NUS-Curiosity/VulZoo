phpAuction is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

phpAuction 3.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
