Description
This very known PHP store is vulnerable to SQL Injection on â€œparentâ€ variable.
Injecting a specific combination of SQL commands will execute the new
SQL query and even provide sensitive database information that could
help a malicious user to complete and enter a valid SQL injection
query.

Proof of concept
parent=1%27)%20order%20by%203/*

Impact
A malicious user could manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary
SQL code and return private information.
