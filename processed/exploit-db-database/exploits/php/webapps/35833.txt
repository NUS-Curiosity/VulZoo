Xataface is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain potentially sensitive information or to execute arbitrary local scripts in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

NOTE (July 4, 2011): The vendor indicates that this issue affects versions prior to Xataface 1.2.6, while the reporter indicates 1.3rc1 and 1.3rc2 are affected.
