It has been reported that Web Chat Manager is prone to HTML injection attacks. This problem occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.

As a result of this insufficiency an attacker may embed HTML code via a HTML form field or URI parameter of the Web Chat Manager user registration page.

It may be possible to steal the unsuspecting user's cookie-based authentication credentials, as well as other sensitive information. Other attacks are also possible.
