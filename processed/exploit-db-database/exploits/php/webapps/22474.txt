A vulnerability has been reported for Py-Membres 4.0 that allows remote attackers to modify the logic of SQL queries.

It has been reported that an input validation error exists in the login.php file included with Py-Membres. Because of this, a remote attacker may launch SQL injection attacks through the software.

http://www.example.org/login.php?login='%20OR%20ISNULL(NULL)%20INTO%20OUTFILE%20'/path/to/site/file.txt&pass=1

This will save all user passwords to the file.txt file, which will be remotely accessible.
