Zoph is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Zoph 0.7.2.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

UPDATE (July 2, 2009): The vendor disputes that Zoph is affected by these issues. Recent versions of Zoph are reported not vulnerable.
