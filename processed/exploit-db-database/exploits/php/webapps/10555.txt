More Details:
=============
A IVE vulnerability is detected on Barracuda - Web Application Firewall 660 with Firmware v7.3.2.015 (2009-12-04 03:23:23am)
Attackers can use the vulnerability script code executions & specific manipulations. When exploited by an authenticated user,
the identified vulnerabilities can lead to Information Disclosure, Session Hijack, access to Intranet available servers.

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by potencial attackers. On our Pentests we verified the vulnerability by loading a
"bad-example.exe" (http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4506/ive1.png) file out of the Barracuda - WebFirewall 660 Appliance Application.
Script code executions & specific manipulations are possible over that form to get access on intranet. For demonstration ...

Fix & Patch:
============
Restrict the Input fields & format the the output when try to show the connection status.
Set clear + working exceptions in the filter or let session expire after illegal character errors.
Involve in the fixes the re-included stuff like the auto backup script on ftp ...



Security Risk:
==============
An attacker is able to include malicious script routines on server-side of the Barracuda - WebFirewall 660.
When exploited by an authenticated user, the identified vulnerabilities can lead to Information Disclosure, Session Hijack,
access to Intranet available servers.The security risk is estimated as medium because of server-side.
