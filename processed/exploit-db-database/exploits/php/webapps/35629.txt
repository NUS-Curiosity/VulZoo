chillyCMS is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information or to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying computer; other attacks are also possible.

chillyCMS 1.2.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
