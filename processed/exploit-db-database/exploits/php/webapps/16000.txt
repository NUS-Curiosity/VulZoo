I. DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------
A vulnerability exists in 'Seo Panel' page rendering which allows for unfiltered, unencrypted content to be presented to a user through two different cookies.


II. TESTED VERSION
---------------------------------------
2.2.0


III. PoC EXPLOIT
---------------------------------------
Alter the value of cookies called 'default_news' or 'sponsors' and then view a site page which includes controllers/index.ctrl.php or controllers/settings.ctrl.php that will render the cookies as they exist on the user's machine.


IV. NOTES
---------------------------------------
* The 'default_news' cookie doesn't require a user to be authenticated whereas 'sponsors' does
* The disclosure date was pushed a full month so that a fix could be released but no update was released yet
* Based on discussions with the developer, they will likely encrypt the cookie contents to prevent this issue


V. SOLUTION
---------------------------------------
Upgrade to a release > 2.2.0 when available or otherwise disable cookie rendering.
