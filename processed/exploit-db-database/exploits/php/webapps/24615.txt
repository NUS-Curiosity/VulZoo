Mambo open source is reportedly affected by multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly validate user-supplied URI parameters.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer, to carry out cross-site scripting attacks, and to make SLQ injection attacks against the vulnerable application.
