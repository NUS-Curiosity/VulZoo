1)Introduction
DFLabs PTK is "an alternative advanced interface for the suite TSK (The Sleuth Kit)".

2)Vulnerability Description
PTK 1.0.5 (and lower) suffer from a CSRF vulnerability which allows an attacker to force administrator/investigator logout at web management
interface. Furthermore PTK's default installation (following the procedure indicated into PTK's "INSTALL" file) doesn't perform "http to https"
redirection in order to secure http connection by transport layer encryption. To default there isn't https redirection in the authentication
phase as well as there isn't https redirection during other PTK's activities. If an internal attacker (the nature of this tool makes difficult
that PTK may have public ip address) makes an Man in the Middle attack (I successfully made it using Dsniff and Ettercap) the CSRF vulnerability
found, forcing the administrator/investigator to logout, will aid the attacker to sniff authentication credentials. This condition can occur when
PTK is used in production environment and the investigator is conducting an analysis about internal people. Of course this logic can be extended
to any person which has access to internal LAN as an attacker which with a client-based exploit can control a internal client which can reach
PTK's server.

This vulnerability is correlated to poor session  check into /<ptk_main_directory>/lib/logout.php script. In fact, differently from other php
script, where there is the php code like the following to session's check:

if (!isset($_SESSION['case_token']) or strcmp($_SESSION['user'],"admin")!=0 or strcmp($_SESSION['case_token'],$_GET['tk'])!=0 or $token_age > 300){
 	new AuditLog('Unauthorized access to delete_case '.sanitize(RemoveXSS($_GET['id']),PARANOID));
        header("location: goto_home.php");

into /<ptk_main_directory>/lib/logout.php there isn't tha above check. This security flaw allows an attacker to force administrator/investigator
logout using a CSRF vulnerability.
When an administrator/investigator browses a web pages which contains the following html/javascript code he is forced to logout at the PTK web
management interface.
