MyBB is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrative access to a site, modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Other attacks may also be possible.


MyBB version 1.0.3 is reported to be vulnerable.
