Exploit

Our researchers discovered a persistent XSS vulnerability, allowing an
attacker to inject arbitrary script code into the comment section of any
existing Mt5.13en installation. The blog comment is being moderated before
published; that means an attacker can target the moderating Admin
(employee) via Javascript Injection.
