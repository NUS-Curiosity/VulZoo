The Miniwork Studio Canteen component for Joomla! is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit the SQL-injection vulnerability to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

An attacker can exploit the local file-include vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to view and execute arbitrary local files within the context of the webserver process. Information harvested may aid in further attacks.

Canteen 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
