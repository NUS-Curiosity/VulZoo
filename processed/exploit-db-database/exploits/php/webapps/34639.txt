CMScout is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to view files and execute local scripts in the context of the webserver process. This may aid in further attacks.

CMScout 2.09 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
