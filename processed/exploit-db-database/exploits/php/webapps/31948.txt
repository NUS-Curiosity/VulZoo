Open Digital Assets Repository System (ODARS) is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute malicious PHP code in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate a compromise of the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

ODARS 1.0.2 is vulnerable; other versions may be affected as well.
