Vanilla is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

Vanilla 1.1.10 and prior versions are vulnerable.
