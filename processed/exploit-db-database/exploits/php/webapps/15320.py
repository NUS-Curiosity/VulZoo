#Software detail: BIGACE - Dynamic Web CMS - is a free, professional grade software package that allows you to set up your own Website within minutes.
#                 Its powerful backend puts you in full control of the layout, service and content of your Pages.
#                 BIGACE is written in the popular language PHP and uses a MySQL database. It is designed to provide #you with all the features you
#                 need from a CMS while having an absolute minimal impact on the resources of the server.
#Vulnerability detail: Also known as a one-click attack or session riding and abbreviated as CSRF or XSRF, is a type of malicious exploit of a website
#                      whereby unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts.
#                      Unlike cross-site scripting (XSS), which exploits the trust a user has for a particular site, CSRF exploits the trust that a site has in a user's browser.
#                      int two word you need the cookie of the user that you wanna attack
