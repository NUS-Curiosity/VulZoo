Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patched version which should be installed immediately.

Users of the product also need to verify that the affected widgets are updated in
the corresponding website project! It could be necessary to rebuild the whole project
or copy the new widgets to the website projects. For further information consult the
vendor.

Furthermore, an in-depth security analysis is highly advised, as the software may be
affected from further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Remote Code Execution (CVE-2018-13981)
The email contact functionality of the widget "formmailer" can upload files
to the server but if the user uploads a PHP script with a .php extension
then the server will rename it to .phps to prevent PHP code execution.

However, the attacker can upload .php5 or .phtml to the server without any
restriction. These alternative file extensions can be executed as PHP code.

Furthermore, the server will create a folder to store the files, with a
random name using PHP's "uniqid" function.

Unfortunately, if the server permits directory listing, the attacker
can easily browse to the uploaded PHP script. If no directory listing is
enabled the attacker can still bruteforce the random name to gain remote
code execution via the PHP script as well. Testing on a local server it
took about 20 seconds to brute force the random name. This attack will
be slower over the Internet but it is still feasible.

Also, if the user runs the Zeta Producer Desktop CMS GUI client locally,
they are also vulnerable because the web server will be running on TCP port 9153.

The root cause is in the widget "formmailer" which is enabled by default.
The following files are affected:
- /assets/php/formmailer/SendEmail.php
- /assets/php/formmailer/functions.php


2) Local File Disclosure (CVE-2018-13980)
If the user enables the widget "filebrowser" on Zeta Producer Desktop CMS an
unauthenticated attacker can read local files by exploiting path traversal issues.

The following files are affected:
- /assets/php/filebrowser/filebrowser.main.php


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Remote Code Execution (CVE-2018-13981)
The following python script can be used to exploit the chain of vulnerabilities.
[.. code has been removed to prevent misuses ..]

When the script is executed, a PHP script (shell) will be uploaded automatically.
# $ python exploit.py
# [+] injecting webshell to http://target/assets/php/formmailer/SendEmail.php

# uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)


2) Local File Disclosure (CVE-2018-13980)
The parameter "file" in the "filebrowser.main.php" script can be exploited to read
arbitrary files from the OS with the privileges of the web server user.
Any unauthenticated user can exploit this issue!
