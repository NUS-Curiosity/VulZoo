The lmtg_myhomepage component for Mambo is prone multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to include an arbitrary remote file containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Versions 1.2 and prior are vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.

This BID has been retired because this issue is not exploitable.
