Title: Synology DSM Blind SQL Injection
Version affected: <= 4.3-3827
Vendor: Synology
Discovered by: Michael Wisniewski
Status: Patched
~~~~~~

The file "/photo/include/blog/article.php" contains a Blind SQL
Injection Vulnerability in the 'value' variable in the URL.

The vendor was contacted approximately 2 weeks ago.  They reviewed the
information and determined that it is vulnerable and a patch has been
released.  The DSM5 official release contains this patch, which was
released earlier this week.  An update for DSM4.x will be released
later this month to address this issue in the 4.x line.  The vendor
also stated that it will be fixed in the next Photo Station hotfix for
the 4.x line.

Work-around: If you don't use the blog, just rename the file.
