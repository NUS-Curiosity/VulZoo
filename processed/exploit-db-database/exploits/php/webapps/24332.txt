Comersus Cart is reportedly affected by a remote SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI parameter input before using it in an SQL query.

The problem presents itself when malicious SQL statements are passed as a value for the username field when authenticating to the application.

As a result of this a malicious user may influence database queries in order to view or modify sensitive information, potentially compromising the software or the database.
