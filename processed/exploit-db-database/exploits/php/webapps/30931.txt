Logaholic is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including multiple SQL-injection issues, a cross-site scripting issue, and an HTML-injection issue. The issues occur because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
