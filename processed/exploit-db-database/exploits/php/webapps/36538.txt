Gregarius is prone to multiple SQL-injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Gregarius versions 0.6.1 and prior are vulnerable.
