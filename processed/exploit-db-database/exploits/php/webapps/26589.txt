OvBB is prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

OvBB 0.08a and prior versions are reportedly affected.
