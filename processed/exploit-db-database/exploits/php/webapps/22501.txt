A vulnerability has been reported for Xonic.ru News. The problem occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data to the 'script.php' file. As a result, it may be possible for an attacker to pass malicious PHP or shell commands in requests to a target server. All commands would be executed on the system with the privileges of the vulnerable application.
