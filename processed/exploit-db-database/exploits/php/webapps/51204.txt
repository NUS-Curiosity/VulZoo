# Vendor Homepage: https://wpmet.com/plugin/metform/
# Software Link: https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/metform.3.1.2.zip
# Version: <= 3.1.2
# Tested on: WordPress version 6.1.1, PHP version 8.0.27 (64bit)
# CVE : CVE-2023-0084

Description:

An unauthenticated attacker can insert a persistent malicious JavaScript
code via the text-area field and because the input is not properly
sanitized the XSS will be executed each time the victim visits the affected
post.
An attacker can steal adminâ€™s session or credentials e.g., using a phishing
attack (display fake login page) and may install a JavaScript backdoor like
the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeeF). ,etc.

Reproduction Steps:

1- Create a new form (using MetForm Elementor widgets) and insert a
text-area field and a submit button then publish the form.
2- Visit the created form (no login needed) and insert the following
JavaScript code in the text-area and submit:
<script>alert(0)</script>
3- By visiting MetForm then Entries from the WP-ADMIN panel and viewing the
inserted post the XSS payload will be executed.

Because there is may bots scanning the web and trying to brute-force
admin's credentials or exploit known vulnerabilities this flaw can be also
automated to steal credentials or do actions on behalf of the logged in
user or even install a JavaScript worm like the Browser Exploitation
Framework (BeeF) and make more than 100,000 websites under a high risk.

Remediation:

All fields must be properly sanitized and escaped before being displayed in
the browser. WordPress already offers an API for this purpose.
