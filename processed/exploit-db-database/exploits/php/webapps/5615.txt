DESCRIPTION:

AS-GasTracker 1.0.0 suffers from Insecure Cookie Handling, when a admin cookie is created its set to "TRUE"
if user is admin and "FALSE" if it isnt. so all we need to do is create a cookie that resembles the one
AS-GasTracker uses. the cookie name being "gastracker_admin".

the javascript code below will create a cookie on the domain its ran on, so simply type the javascript below
into Firefox/Netscape, then visit /admin/



Vulnerability:

javascript:document.cookie = "gastracker_admin=TRUE; path=/";



NOTE/TIP:

after running the javascript code in your browser on the vulnerable domain, browse to /admin/ and you will have
access.
