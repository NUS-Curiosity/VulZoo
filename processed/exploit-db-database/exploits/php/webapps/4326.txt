Remote File Inclusion
---------------------
It is possible for a remote attacker to include a file from local or
remote resources and/or execute arbitrary script code with the
privileges of the webserver.

Proof of Concept:

index.php?loadpage=../../../../file
index.php?loadpage=[evilscript]

Solution:

Edit the source code to ensure that input is properly validated. Where
is possible, it is recommended to make a list of accepted filenames
and restrict the input to that list.

For PHP, the option allow_url_fopen would normally allow a programmer
to open, include or otherwise use a remote file using a URL rather
than a local file path. It is recommended to disable this option from
php.ini.


SQL Injection
-------------
An attacker may execute arbitrary SQL statements on the vulnerable
system. This may compromise the integrity of your database and/or
expose sensitive information.

Proof of Concept:

index.php?blockpage=%2E%2Findex%2Ephp
%3Fblockpage%3D1%26cat%3D&cat=[SQL Injection]
index.php?blockpage=%2E%2Findex%2Ephp
%3Fblockpage%3D1%26cat%3D&cat='


Solution:

Your script should filter metacharacters from user input.
