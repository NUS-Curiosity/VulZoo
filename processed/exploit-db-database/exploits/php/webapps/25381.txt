WebCT is reportedly affected by an HTML injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be able to access properties of the site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

This issue is reported to affect WebCT Version 4.1; other versions may also be affected.
