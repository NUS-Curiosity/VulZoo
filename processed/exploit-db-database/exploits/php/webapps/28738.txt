digiSHOP is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

This issue affects version 4.0.0; other versions may also be vulnerable.
