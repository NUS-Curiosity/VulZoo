The Joomla! Webee component is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage the HTML-injection issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is viewed, and launch other attacks.

The attacker may exploit the SQL-injection issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Webee 1.1.1 is vulnerable to all these issues. Webee 1.2 is reportedly affected by the SQL-injection issue and possibly the HTML-injection issues as well.
