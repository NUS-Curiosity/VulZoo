PHPFinance is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may exploit the HTML-injection issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is displayed, and launch other attacks.

The attacker may exploit the SQL-injection issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

PHPFinance 0.6 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following examples are available:

HTML Injection

>"<iframe src=http://test.de> or >"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script><div style="1

SQL Injection
