Shoutbox is prone to directory traversal attacks. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied values to URI parameters.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the value of the affected 'conf' URI parameter to obtain any files readable by the web server.
