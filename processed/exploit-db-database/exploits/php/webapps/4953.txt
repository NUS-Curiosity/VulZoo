# Description:
#
# OZJournals uses .php-files as it's storage, and posts are read from them with the
# getcontents-function. This protects from traditional LFI-exploits, but the print
# -functionality, for instance, takes an id as a value, and allows an attacker to get
# the contents of files other than intended. Before printing the php-file is
# explode()d with "\t", but seeing as many scripts have tabs in their configuration
# files, an attacker could, with some luck, fish out database credentials or other
# sensitive data.
#
# This is a VERY low risk vulnerability, but can potentially provide additional
# reconnaissance data for an attacker.
#
# Example;

http://localhost/ozjournals/?show=printpreview&id=../config

#
# Vulnerable code:

$pfile = file_get_contents("$datadirectory/$id.php");

#
# Again as I said, this is a very low risk vulnerability, but I see no reason for
# AQOnline Networks not to fix it, even after having been notified about it numerous
# times.
#
# Good luck and be safe.
# In memoriam Anna-Emilia...
