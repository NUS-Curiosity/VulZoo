Books is a module written for PostNuke. Reportedly, Books is prone to cross site scripting attacks.

An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by enticing a victim user to follow a malicious link containing HTML and script code. The attacker-supplied HTML and script code may be executed on a web client in the context of the site hosting the vulnerable module.

Attackers may potentially exploit this issue to manipulate web content or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. It may be possible to take arbitrary actions as the victim user.
