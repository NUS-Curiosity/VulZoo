Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in the Eventy CMS v1.8 Plus.


Report-Timeline:

Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
A SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in the Eventy CMS v1.8 Plus ,web based event calendar software.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to execute a SQL commands on the
affected application dbms. The sql injection vulnerability is located in eventy.php file with the bound vulnerable
event_id parameter. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.
Exploitation requires no user interaction & without privileged user account.

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] eventy.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] event_id


1.2
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in the Eventy CMS v1.8 Plus ,web based event calendar software.
The bug allows remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
The persistent vulnerabilities is located in the the add Event module bound vulnerable Event Title and Event Location
parameters. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent)
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged web application user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Add Event

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Event Title - Event Location

1.3
A non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected in the Eventy CMS v1.8 Plus ,web based event calendar software.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high required
user inter action or local low privileged user account. The vulnerability is located in the eventy.php page the bound vulnerable selyear
and selmonth parameter. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in account steal, client site phishing or client-side
content request manipulation.

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] eventy.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] selyear - selmonth


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user accounr and without
required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

</body></head></html>


1.2
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low or medium required user inter action
& low privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Manaually Reproduce ...
The attacker can create a new event with injecting a malicious code i.e.,
>"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com onload=alert("VL")</iframe>, in the field Event Title - Event Location Fields.
When the admin or any other user view the event the code gets executed.

</body></head></html>


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the remote SQL Injection vulnerability is estimated as critical.

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium(+).

1.3
The security risk of the client side cross site scripting vulnerability is estimated as low(+).
