LetoDMS (formerly known as MyDMS) is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying computer; other attacks are also possible.

LetoDMS 1.7.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
