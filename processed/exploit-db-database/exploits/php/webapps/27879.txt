------------------------------------------------------------
Joomla! VirtueMart component <= 2.0.22a - SQL Injection
------------------------------------------------------------

== Description ==
- Software link: http://www.virtuemart.net/
- Affected versions: All versions between 2.0.8 and 2.0.22a are vulnerable.
- Vulnerability discovered by: Matias Fontanini

== Vulnerability ==
The vulnerability is located in the "user" controller, "removeAddressST"
task. The "virtuemart_userinfo_id" parameter is not properly sanitized
before being used in the "DELETE" query performed in it, allowing the
execution of arbitrary SQL queries.

In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be authenticated
as a customer in the application. However, since the system allows free
account registration, this is not a problem.

== Proof of concept ==
The following example URL uses the MySQL "sleep" function through the
injection:

http://example.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&view=user&task=removeAddressST&virtuemart_userinfo_id=16%22%20and%20sleep(10)%20and%20%22%22%3D%22

== Solution ==
Upgrade the product to the 2.0.22b version.
