Real Estate Portal v4.1 Remote Code Execution Vulnerability


Vendor: NetArt Media
Product web page: http://www.netartmedia.net
Affected version: 4.1

Summary: Real Estate Portal is a software written in PHP,
allowing you to launch powerful and professional looking
real estate portals with rich functionalities for the private
sellers, buyers and real estate agents to list properties
for sale or rent, search in the database, show featured
ads and many others. The private sellers can manage their
ads at any time through their personal administration space.

Desc: Real Estate Portal suffers from an arbitrary file upload
vulnerability leading to an arbitrary PHP code execution. The
vulnerability is caused due to the improper verification of
uploaded files in '/upload.php' script thru the 'myfile' POST
parameter. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code
by uploading a malicious PHP script file with '.php' extension
that will be stored in the '/uploads' directory.

Tested on: nginx/1.10.0
           PHP/5.2.17
           MySQL/5.1.66
