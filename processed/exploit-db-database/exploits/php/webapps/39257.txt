Tera Charts plugin for WordPress is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to obtain potentially sensitive information; other attacks are also possible.

Tera Charts 0.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
