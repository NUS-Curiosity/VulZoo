The ShopperPress WordPress theme is prone to an SQL-injection and multiple cross-site vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits will allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, to compromise the application, to access or modify data, or to exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

ShopperPress 2.7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
