phpAlbum is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary remote PHP code on an affected computer with the privileges of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.

phpAlbum 0.3.2.3 and prior versions are affected.
