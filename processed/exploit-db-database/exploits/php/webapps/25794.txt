YaPiG is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An authorized user can add and delete arbitrary directories outside of the gallery directory by supplying directory traversal strings '../' to the vulnerable parameter. Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a loss of integrity and possibly loss of availability.

This issue is reported to affect YaPiG versions 0.92b, 0.93u and 0.94u; earlier versions may also be affected.
