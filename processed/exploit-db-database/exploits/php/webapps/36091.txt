IBM Open Admin Tool is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

IBM Open Admin Tool 2.71 and prior are vulnerable.
