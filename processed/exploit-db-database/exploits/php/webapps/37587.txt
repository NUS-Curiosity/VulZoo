GetSimple is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain potentially sensitive information or to execute arbitrary local scripts in the context of the web server process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

GetSimple 3.1.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
