The CiviCRM component for Joomla! is prone to multiple arbitrary file-upload vulnerabilities that allows attackers to upload arbitrary files because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to upload arbitrary code and run it in the context of the web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation; other attacks are also possible.
