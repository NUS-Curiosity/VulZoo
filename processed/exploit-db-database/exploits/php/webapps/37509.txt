EmbryoCore CMS is prone to multiple directory-traversal vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Remote attackers can use specially crafted requests with directory-traversal sequences ('../') to retrieve arbitrary files in the context of the application.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

EmbryoCore 1.03 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
