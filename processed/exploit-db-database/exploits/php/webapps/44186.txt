1. Description:
The My Arcade plugin adds a page of arcade games and keeps track of user scores, also allowing users to add a comment next to their score. The comment box is vulnerable to a persistent XSS.


2. Proof of Concept:

Persistent XSS
- Play an arcade game
- Add the following comment to your score <p """><SCRIPT>alert("XSS")</SCRIPT>">
- Edit the comment, Boom.


3. Solution:
Update to 1.3.1
