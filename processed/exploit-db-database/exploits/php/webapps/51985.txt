There is an sql injection vulnerability in *miniform* module which is a
default module installed in the *WBCE* cms. It is an unauthenticated
sqli so anyone could access it and takeover the whole database.

In file /modules/miniform/ajax_delete_message.php there is no
authentication check. On line |40| in this file, there is a |DELETE|
query that is vulnerable, an attacker could jump from the query using
tick sign - ```.

Function |addslashes()|
(https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.addslashes.php) escapes only
these characters and not a tick sign:

  * single quote (')
  * double quote (")
  * backslash ()
  * NUL (the NUL byte

The DB_RECORD_TABLE parameter is vulnerable.

If an unauthenticated attacker send this request:

```

POST /modules/miniform/ajax_delete_message.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; OpenBSD i386) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.125 Safari/537.36
Connection: close

```

The response is received after 6s.
