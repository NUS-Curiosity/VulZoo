RSS-aggregator is prone to multiple SQL-injection and authentication-bypass vulnerabilities.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database, and gain administrative access to the affected application.

RSS-aggregator 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
