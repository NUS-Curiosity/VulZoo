The 'bcoos' program is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to include local scripts in the context of the application. This may allow the attacker to access sensitive information that may aid in further attacks.

This issue affects bcoos 1.0.13; other versions may also be affected.
