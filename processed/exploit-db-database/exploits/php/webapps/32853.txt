TikiWiki is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site and to steal cookie-based authentication credentials.

TikiWiki 2.2 through 3.0 beta1 are vulnerable.
