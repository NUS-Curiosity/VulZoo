1024cms is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, multiple local file-include vulnerabilities, and a directory-traversal vulnerability

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and open or run arbitrary files in the context of the webserver process ad gain access to sensitive information.

1024cms 1.1.0 beta is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
