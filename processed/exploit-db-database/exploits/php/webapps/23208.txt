It has been reported that MPNews PRO is prone to an information disclosure vulnerability. The problem is believed to occur due to MPNews PRO failing to sufficiently filter specific dot-dot-slash sequences (../). As a result, an attacker may be capable of viewing the contents of files located outside of the established web root.
