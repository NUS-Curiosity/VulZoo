Osprey is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying computer; other attacks are also possible.

Osprey 1.0a4.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
