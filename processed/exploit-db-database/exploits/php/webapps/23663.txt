It has been reported that the PHP-Nuke module 'News' is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The issue arises due to the module failing to properly sanitize user-supplied information. This could allow for execution of hostile HTML and script code in the web client of a user who visits a web page that contains the malicious code. This would occur in the security context of the site hosting the software.
