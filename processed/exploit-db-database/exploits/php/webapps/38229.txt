IP.Gallery is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

IP.Gallery 2.0.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
