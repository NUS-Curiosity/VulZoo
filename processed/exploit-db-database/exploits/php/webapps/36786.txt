11in1 is prone to a cross-site request-forgery and a local file include vulnerability.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and open or run arbitrary files in the context of the affected application.

11in1 1.2.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
