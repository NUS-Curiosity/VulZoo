II. DESCRIPTION

A parameter is not properly sanitised before being used in
a SQL query.


III. ANALYSIS

Summary:

 A) Blind SQL Injection


A) Blind SQL Injection

The id parameter in profile.php is not  properly sanitised
before being used in a SQL query. That  is  not  the query
which selects the information about the  user specified by
the id parameter but is the query that selects the image's
name. The affected query is a query of five fields.

When the injected condition is true, in  the  page will be
printed the  real  link  to the personal image of the user
specified  by  the  id  parameter,  otherwise  a  link  to
bignophoto.gif.

True condition:
http://site/path/images/profiles/id_random.jpg

False condition:
http://site/path/images/profiles/bignophoto.gif

Successful exploitation requires  that "magic_quotes_gpc"
is disabled and that the user specified by  id parameter
has posted an image.


IV. SAMPLE CODE

http://site/path/profile.php?id=10' AND 1=1%23
http://site/path/profile.php?id=10' AND 1=0%23
