NetClassifieds is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input. These vulnerabilities include multiple SQL-injection issues and cross-site scripting issues.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

NetClassifieds Free, Standard, Professional, and Premium editions are reported vulnerable.
