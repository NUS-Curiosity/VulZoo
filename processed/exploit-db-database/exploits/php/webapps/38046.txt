The Zingiri Web Shop plugin for WordPress is prone to an arbitrary file-upload vulnerability because it fails to adequately validate files before uploading them.

An attacker may leverage this issue to upload arbitrary files to the affected computer; this can result in arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable application.

Zingiri Web Shop 2.5.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
