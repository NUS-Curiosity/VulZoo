Vendor: phpList Ltd
Product web page: http://www.phplist.com

Summary: phplist is the world's most popular open source
email campaign manager. phplist is free to download, install
and use, and is easy to integrate with any website. phplist
is downloaded more than 10,000 times per month.

Desc: Input passed via the parameter 'sortby' is not properly
sanitised before being returned to the user or used in SQL queries.

arbitrary SQL code. The param 'num' is vulnerable to a XSS issue
where the attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in
a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
