evalSMSI is prone to multiple vulnerabilities, including an authentication-bypass issue, an SQL-Injection issue, and an HTML-Injection issue.

Attackers can exploit these issues to gain administrative access to the affected application, execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database. Other attacks may also be possible.

Versions prior to evalSMSI 2.2.00 are vulnerable.
