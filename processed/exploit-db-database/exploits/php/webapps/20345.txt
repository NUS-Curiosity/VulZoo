Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple cross site vulnerabilities in the iAuto Mobile APP for Android, iOS & Blackberry.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-07-10:  Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in the iAuto Mobile APP for Android, iOS (iPhone), Ericsson & Blackberry.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). The persistent vulnerability
is located in comments module with the bound vulnerable commentSid parameter. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to session
hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action & privileged user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
        [+] Comments > Reply to The Comment Listing

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
        [+] commentSid & commentInfo


1.2
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in the iAuto Mobile APP for Android, iOS (iPhone), Ericsson & Blackberry.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high required user inter action or
local low privileged user account. The bugs are located in the  Dealer > Search Sellers or Browse by Make and Model with the bound vulnerable
parameters city & path/url. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, client side phishing & client-side content request manipulation.
Exploitation requires medium or high user inter action & without privileged web application user account.


Vulnerable Module(s):
        [+] Dealer > Search Sellers > City
        [+] Browse by Make and Model > /../ >

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
        [+] City
        [+] Folder Access Listing


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The persistent vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged user account and with low required user inter action.
