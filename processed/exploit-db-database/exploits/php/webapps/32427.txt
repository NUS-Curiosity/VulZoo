Barcode Generator is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to include an arbitrary remote file containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying computer; other attacks are also possible.

Barcode Generator 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
