Easy Banner Free is prone to multiple SQL-injection and HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage the HTML-injection issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is viewed, and launch other attacks.

The attacker may exploit the SQL-injection issues to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Easy Banner Free 2009.05.18 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
