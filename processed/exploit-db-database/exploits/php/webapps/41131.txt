## About The Product : ##
Complain Management is a Web based project used to manage Customer's complain Online. User can login, and Create complain, view complain details and track the status of its complain.

## Vulnerability : ##
The functions.php file line 88 has hardcoded admin credentials.
		elseif($uType == 'admin'){
			//$_SESSION['user_id'] = $row['sid'];
			if($userName == 'admin' && $password == 'admin123'){
				$_SESSION['user_id'] = 0;
				$_SESSION['user_name'] = 'Administrator';
				$_SESSION['user_type'] = 'admin';
				header('Location: '.WEB_ROOT.'index.php');
				exit;

Using the hardcoded admin credentials we then have access to the process.php file that is vulnerable to SQL injection.
