It has been reported that DCP-Portal does not sufficiently filter URI parameters supplied to the DCP-Portal 'calender' script.

As a result of this deficiency, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user. All code will be executed within the context of the website running DCP-Portal.

This may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.

This vulnerability was reported to affect DCP-Portal version 5.3.1, it is not currently known if other versions are affected.
