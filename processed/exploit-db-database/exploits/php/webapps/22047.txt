FreeNews is a freely available, open source News software package. It is written in PHP, and designed for use on Unix and Linux operating systems.

Programming errors in FreeNews could lead to the inclusion of arbitrary files on remote servers in the web application. It is possible for a remote user to place commands in these include files that could result in execution on the local host. This would make remote arbitrary command execution as the web user possible.
