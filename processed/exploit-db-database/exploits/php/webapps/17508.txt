Class: Cross-Site Scripting (Persistence)	Severity: Medium


Overview:
---------
appRain 0.1.4-Alpha(Quick Start Edition) and appRain-d-0.1.3 (Core Edition)
multiple Persistence Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.


Technical Description:
----------------------
i) appRain 0.1.4-Alpha(Quick Start Edition) and appRain-d-0.1.3 (Core Edition) are
   prone to multiple persistence cross-site scripting vulnerabilities as it fails
   to properly sanitise user-supplied input.

   Input passed via the 'ss' parameter in 'search' action is not properly verified
   before it is returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary
   HTML and script code in a user's browser session in the context of a vulnerable
   site. This may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication
   credentials and launch further attacks.


ii) Input passed via the 'data[sconfig][site_title]' parameter in '/admin/config/general'
    action is not properly verified before it is returned to the user. This can be
    exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session
    in the context of a vulnerable site. This may allow an authinticated attacker to
    launch further attacks.

    NOTE: Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

    The vulnerability has been tested in appRain 0.1.4-Alpha (Quick Start Edition),
    appRain-q-0.1.3 (Quick Start Edition), appRain-q-0.1.1 (Quick Start Edition),
    appRain-d-0.1.3 (Core Edition) and appRain-d-0.1.2 (Core Edition) ,Other versions
    may also be affected.


Impact:
--------
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML
code in a user's browser session in the context of a vulnerable application.


Affected Software:
------------------
i) appRain 0.1.4-Alpha (Quick Start Edition) and prior.

ii)appRain-d-0.1.3 (Core Edition) and prior.
   appRain 0.1.4-Alpha (Quick Start Edition) and prior.

Tested on,
ppRain 0.1.4-Alpha (Quick Start Edition),
appRain-q-0.1.3 (Quick Start Edition),
appRain-q-0.1.1 (Quick Start Edition),
appRain-d-0.1.3 (Core Edition) and
appRain-d-0.1.2 (Core Edition)
