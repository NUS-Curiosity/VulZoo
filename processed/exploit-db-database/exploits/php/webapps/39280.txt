The WordPress HDW Player plugin (Video Player & Video Gallery) is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

An attacker can exploit this issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

HDW Player 2.4.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
