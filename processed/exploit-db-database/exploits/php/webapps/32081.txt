Lemon CMS is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to view local files within the context of the webserver process. Information harvested may aid in further attacks.

Lemon CMS 1.10 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
