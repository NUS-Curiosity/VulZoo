saralblog is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or possibly permit an attacker to control how the site is rendered to the user. They may also permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation as well as other attacks.

The following proof of concept URI for some of the SQL injection issues are available:
http://www.example.com/viewprofile.php?id=999%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7/*

Also supplying the following to the search parameter:
aaaaa') union select 1,2,3,4,5,6/*
