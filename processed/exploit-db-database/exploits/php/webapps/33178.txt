Computer Associates SiteMinder is prone to a security-bypass vulnerability because it fails to properly validate user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to bypass cross-site scripting protections. Successful exploits can aid in further attacks.

We don't know which versions of SiteMinder are affected. We will update this BID when more details become available.
