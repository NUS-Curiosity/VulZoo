NextAge Shopping Cart is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities; the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be executed in the context of the affected website, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.
