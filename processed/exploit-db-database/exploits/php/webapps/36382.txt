1-jquery-photo-gallery-slideshow-flash plug-in for WordPress is prone to a cross-site-scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

1-jquery-photo-gallery-slideshow-flash 1.01 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

UPDATE April 18, 2012: Further reports indicate this issue may not be a vulnerability; the issue can not be exploited as described.
