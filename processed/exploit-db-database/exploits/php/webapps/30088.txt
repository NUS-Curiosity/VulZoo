Pligg is prone to a security-bypass vulnerability due to a design error when resetting forgotten passwords.

An attacker may exploit this issue to reset account passwords for arbitrary users and then compromise a vulnerable application. This can also aid the attacker in further attacks.

Pligg 9.5 is reported vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
