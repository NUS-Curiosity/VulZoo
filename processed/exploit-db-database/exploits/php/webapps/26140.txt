ezUpload is affected by multiple remote file include vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage any of these issues to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.
