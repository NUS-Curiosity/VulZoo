FreznoShop is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. Remote attackers may create malicious links to the software that include hostile HTML and script code. If such a link was followed by a victim user, the attacker-supplied code would be rendered in the security context of the site hosting the software.

This could be exploited to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.
