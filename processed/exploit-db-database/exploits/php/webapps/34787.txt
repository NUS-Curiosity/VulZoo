MODx is prone to a local file-include vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit the local file-include vulnerability using directory-traversal strings to view and execute local files within the context of the webserver process. Information harvested may aid in further attacks.

The attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may let the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

MODx 2.0.2-pl is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
