CubeCart is reported prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

These issues affect the 'index.php', 'tellafriend.php', 'view_cart.php', and 'view_product.php' script.

These vulnerabilities could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in modification of query logic or other attacks.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. This is not confirmed.
