Nibbleblog is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Nibbleblog 3.0 is affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.
