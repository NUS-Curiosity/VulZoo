NextBBS is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities, a cross-site scripting vulnerability, and an authentication-bypass vulnerability.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database, and bypass the authentication process to gain unauthorized access to the system.

NextBBS 0.6.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
