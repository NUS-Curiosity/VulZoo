LandShop is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, access or modify sensitive data, execute arbitrary script code in the context of the application, compromise the application, and possibly exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.
