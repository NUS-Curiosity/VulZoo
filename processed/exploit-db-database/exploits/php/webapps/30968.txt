MODx is prone to a vulnerability that allows attackers to access source code because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the webserver process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks.

MODx 0.9.6.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
