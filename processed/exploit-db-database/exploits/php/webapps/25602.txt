FishCart is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit of the SQL-injection issues could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
