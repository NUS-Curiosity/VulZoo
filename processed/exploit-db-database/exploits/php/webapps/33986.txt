PHP File Uploader is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers upload arbitrary files because the application fails to adequately limit the types of files that are uploaded.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to upload arbitrary code and run it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation; other attacks may also possible.
