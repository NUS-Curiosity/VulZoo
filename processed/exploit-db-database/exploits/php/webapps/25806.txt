Invision Gallery is affected by an SQL injection vulnerability.

This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'index.php' script before using it in an SQL query.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Invision Gallery 1.3.0 and prior are vulnerable.
