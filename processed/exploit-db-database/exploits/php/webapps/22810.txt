Reportedly, pMachine is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack. The vulnerability is present in the search module. The issue presents itself likely due to insufficient sanitization performed on user-supplied data that is passed as the query to the affected module.

An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by enticing a victim user to follow a malicious link. Attacker-supplied code passed as the keywords URI parameter may execute within the context of the site hosting the vulnerable software when the malicious link is visited.
