SugarCRM Community Edition is prone to multiple information-disclosure vulnerabilities because it fails to restrict access to certain application data.

Attackers can exploit these issues to obtain sensitive information that may lead to further attacks.

SugarCRM Community Edition 6.5.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
