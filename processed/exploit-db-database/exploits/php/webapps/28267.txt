LinksCaffe is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities. The issues include cross-site scripting and SQL-injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or even exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Other attacks are also possible.
