Seditio and Land Down Under are prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because the applications fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the applications, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

This issue affects Seditio version 1.10 and Land Down Under versions 8.x; other versions may also be vulnerable.
