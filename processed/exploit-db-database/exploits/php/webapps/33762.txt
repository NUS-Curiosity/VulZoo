Andromeda is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and a session-fixation vulnerability.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site and gain unauthorized access to the affected application.

Andromeda 1.9.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
