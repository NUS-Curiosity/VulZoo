-------------------


--- [ Remote File Upload Vulnerability ] ---
===============================================
A remote file upload vulnerability is present in LightBlog version 9.5.
Users without permissions are able to upload any kind of files, also .php; so the attacker can upload their own remote PHP
shell.
The file vulnerable is: cp_upload_image.php, and you can find it under the root directory of the blog uploaded. (shown
in the section PoC).


--- [ PoC ] ---
===============
http://localhost/light/cp_upload_image.php
Just look for your PHP shell, upload it (shell.php) and then use it:
http://localhost/light/images/shell.php


--- [ Patch ] ---
===============
- Edit the source code.
- use CHMOD
- Delete cp_upload_image.php
- Use the vendor patch.
