Print Topic Mod is reportedly affected by a remote SQL injection vulnerability in the 'printview.php' script. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI parameter input before using it in an SQL query.

Print Topic Mod version 1.0 is reported to be affected by this issue.
