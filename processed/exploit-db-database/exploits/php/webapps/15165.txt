Zen Cart v1.3.9f Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities


Vendor: Zen Ventures, LLC
Product web page: http://www.zen-cart.com
Version affected: 1.3.9f

Summary: Zen Cart is an online store management system. It is PHP-based, using a MySQL
database and HTML components. Support is provided for numerous languages and currencies,
and it is freely available under the GNU GPL.

Desc: Zen Cart v1.3.9f suffers from a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL
injection vulnerability. The SQLi issue lies in "option_name_manager.php" script in the
"option_order_by" parameter thru the admin UI (post-auth). Input is not sanitized resulting
in compromising the db system.

The stored/persistent XSS issue lies pretty much everywhere in the admin panel when editing
and inserting strings in different categories. Ex:

- In Admin UI go to http://127.0.0.1/admin/record_company.php or Extras > Record Companies
and click "insert". Fill out the 1st or 3rd or 4th field or all of them, with the string:
"<script>alert("xss")</script>" and click save. Now...every time when you go back to that page
it will execute the code for every field.


Tested On: Apache 2.2.11 (Win32)
           PHP 5.3.0
           MySQL 5.1.36
