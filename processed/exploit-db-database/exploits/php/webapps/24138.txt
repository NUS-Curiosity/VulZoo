It is reported that e107 website system is prone to a remote HTML injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure by the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

The problem presents itself when a user supplies malicious HTML or script code to the application using a URI parameter of the log.php script. The application stores the injected HTML code, which is then rendered in the browser of an unsuspecting user whenever the log page of the affected site is viewed.
