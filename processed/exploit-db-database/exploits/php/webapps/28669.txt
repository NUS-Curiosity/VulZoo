BirdBlog is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

BirdBlog 1.4.0 and prior versions are reported vulnerable.
