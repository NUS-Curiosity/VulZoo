PHP Event Calendar is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Version 1.5.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
