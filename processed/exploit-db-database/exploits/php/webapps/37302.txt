Software description:

"E-Detective is a real-time Internet interception, monitoring and
forensics system that captures, decodes, and reconstructs various types
of Internet traffic. It is commonly used for organization Internet
behavioural monitoring, auditing, record keeping, forensics analysis, and
investigation, as well as, legal and lawful interception for lawful
enforcement agencies such as Police Intelligence, Military Intelligence,
Cyber Security Departments, National Security Agencies, Criminal
Investigation Agencies, Counter Terrorism Agencies etc."

The /common/download.php in the web root allows for an unauthenticated
user to read any file on the system that the web user has access to.
This includes database credentials and any traffic intercepts captured
by the system.

The "file" parametre is "protected" by inadequate "cipher": base64
followed by rot40, which is trivially reversible.

2) Authenticated Remote Code Execution

The restore feature in the "config backup" page extracts a .tar file
encrypted with OpenSSL blowfish into the root directory (/) as root.

The .tar file should be encrypted with the static key "/tmp/.charlie".
Yes, that's the actual key - they pass the wrong argument to OpenSSL.
They used -k instead of -kfile, thus the key is the path of the key file
rather than the contents of the key file.

This enables an attacker to upload a shell into the web root, or
overwrite any system files such as /etc/shadow.
