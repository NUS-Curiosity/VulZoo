QuiXplorer is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

QuiXplorer 2.4.1beta is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
