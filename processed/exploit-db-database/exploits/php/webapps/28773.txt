Deep CMS is affected by a remote file-include vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the webserver process.

Version 2.0a is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
