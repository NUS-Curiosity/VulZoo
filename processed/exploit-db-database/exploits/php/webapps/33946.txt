EmiratesHost is prone to an authentication-bypass vulnerability because it fails to adequately verify user-supplied input used for cookie-based authentication.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrative access to the affected application, which may aid in further attacks.

The following example data is available:

www.example.com/admin
javascript:document.cookie="login=right;path=/";
