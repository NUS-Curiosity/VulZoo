Gallarific is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and multiple authentication-bypass vulnerabilities.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, add new categories, add new users, and modify existing users. Other attacks are also possible.

These issues affect both the commercial and the free versions of Gallarific.
