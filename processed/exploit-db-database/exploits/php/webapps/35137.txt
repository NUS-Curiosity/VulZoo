Social Share is prone to an HTTP response-splitting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attackers can leverage this issue to influence or misrepresent how web content is served, cached, or interpreted. This could aid in various attacks that try to entice client users into a false sense of trust.

The following example input is available:

Vulnerable code: $referrer = $_SERVER[HTTP_REFERER]; header("Location: $referrer");

HTTP query ("Referer" field):

Referer: http://www.example.com/\r\n[second new response]
