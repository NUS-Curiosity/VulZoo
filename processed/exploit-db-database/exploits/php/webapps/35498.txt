Ripe Website Manager is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Ripe Website Manager 1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
