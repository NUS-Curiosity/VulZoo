Siteman is prone to a local file-include vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this as a cross-site scripting issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Or, the attacker may exploit the issue as a local file-include vulnerability to view files and execute local scripts in the context of the webserver process. This may aid in further attacks.

Siteman 2.0.x2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
