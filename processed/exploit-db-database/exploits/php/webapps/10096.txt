When this hole was brought to our attention, we were amazed to find that it seems nobody has caught it yet!! There is a page in the admin that can be access without login AND can pass parameters!!

/admin/mail.php/login.php
/admin/mail.php/login.php?fooled
/admin/mail.php/login.php?action=send_email_to_user

All work!

We "patched" this hole by adding this line of code:

if(strstr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], "/admin/mail.php/login.php" ) !== false){
        echo "<h1>NO ACCESS</h1>";
        exit;
}


Go fix your carts!!!!
