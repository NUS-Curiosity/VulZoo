Testa OTMS is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

An attacker can exploit these issues by manipulating the SQL query logic to carry out unauthorized actions on the underlying database.

Testa OTMS 2.0.0.2 is vulnerable; other version may also be vulnerable.
