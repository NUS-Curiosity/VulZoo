This project looks nice but lacks a lot of input filtering.

This example allows a logged-in user to inject JavaScript code, and this
case steal a session ID, but other exploits could be injected.

This exploit example assumes you have installed VAM 2.6.2 on a local server.

Steps :-

1. Log on. There is an admin account: Callsign: vam100, Password: 123456

2. Click "Pilot Actions"

3. Click "Internal Mail"

4. Click New Message

5. In "Subject" enter XSS <script>alert(document.cookie);//<</script>

6. in "Message" type anything

7. Click "Send"

8. When the page refreshes your PHP session ID will show in an alert box

It is also quite possible to inject raw HTML into the subject.

A bit of Google Dorking revealed many websites running this, some were
dead, some deserted and a few were live.
