TinyCMS is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities and an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit these issues to upload arbitrary files onto the web server, execute arbitrary local files within the context of the web server, and obtain sensitive information.

TinyCMS 1.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
