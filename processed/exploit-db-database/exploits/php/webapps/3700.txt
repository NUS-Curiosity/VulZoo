4. Installation

Unpack file "index.php" from this archive and upload it to separate directory (e.g. "photos/") on your web server.
In order to enable caching capabilities, you need to create the new directory named "weatimages-cache" in directory
with "index.php" and to set access rights 777 (rwxrwxrwx) to "weatimages-cache".
If you plan to customize configuration, upload "weatimages.ini" too.

If weatimages.ini was uploaded too then the product isn't vulnerable.
