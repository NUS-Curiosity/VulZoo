SQL Injection:
Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, and LDAP injection, occur when
untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The
attackerâ€™s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended
commands or accessing data without proper authorization.

Attack vector:
An attacker can gain admin panel access using malicious sql injection queries.

Steps to reproduce:
1) Open admin login page using following URl:
"http://localhost/covid-tms/login.php"

2) Now put the payload below the Username and password field.
Payload: admin' or '1'='1 and you will be successfully logged In as Admin without any credentials.
