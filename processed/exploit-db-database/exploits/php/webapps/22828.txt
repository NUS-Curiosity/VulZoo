INGRESS SECURITY SECURITY ADVISORY
INGRES-11172012-WeBid Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
November 17, 2012

OVERVIEW
Ingress Security researchers have found a Cross Site Request Forgery and persistent Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in the WeBid auction house software.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS
WeBid version 1.0.5 and prior.

PLATFORM: Multiple

LOCAL/REMOTE: Remote

CVSS SCORE: 5.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:P/RL:U/RC:ND/CDP:LM/TD:M/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND)

DESCRIPTION OF VULNERABILITIES

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
WeBid does not properly check user input, thus allowing the <iframe> to execute and allow an attacker to send malicious code to the user who views the auction.

[Authenticated User]

URL: http://[host]/WeBid/sell.php#goto

The user is then presented with a fully-featured description box to input the malicious code using <iframe>. We believe that there are also other vulnerable issues such as possible <img> tag manipulation as well, although they haven't been tested.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
The following URLs are vulnerable to XSS attacks. Malicious attackers may access cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by a browser and used with the website.

[Authenticated Administrator]

This persistent XSS vulnerability allows a malicious administrator to setup the copyright notice to steal cookies or other sensitive information.

http://[host]/WeBid/admin/settings.php

In the Your copyright message section, add:
