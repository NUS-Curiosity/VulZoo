It is reported that EPay Pro is affected by various cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

These problems present themselves when malicious HTML and script code is sent to the application through multiple parameters.

This issue may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

EPay Pro version 2.0 is vulnerable to these issues.
