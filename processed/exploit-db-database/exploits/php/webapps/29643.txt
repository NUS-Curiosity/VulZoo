Simple one-file gallery is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including a local file-include issue and a cross-site scripting issue.

An attacker can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to view and execute arbitrary local files within the context of the affected webserver. Other attacks are also possible.
