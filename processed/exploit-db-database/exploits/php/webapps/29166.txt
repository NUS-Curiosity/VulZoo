InverseFlow Help Desk is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Version 2.31 is vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected. Ace Helpdesk and PMOS Helpdesk have also been confirmed to be vulnerable to these isssues.
