iSearch is affected by a remote file-include vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the webserver process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.

iSearch 2.16 and prior versions are reported affected.

Update: This BID is retired; further information has revealed that this is not a vulnerability.
