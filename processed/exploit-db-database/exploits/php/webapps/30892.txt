Neuron News is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including an SQL-injection issue and two cross-site scripting issues, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

These issues affect Neuron News 1.0; other versions may also be affected.
