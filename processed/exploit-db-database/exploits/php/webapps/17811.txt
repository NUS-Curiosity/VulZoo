SecPod ID: 1020					20/07/2011 Issue Discovered

						No Response from Vendor

Class: Cross-Site Scripting / SQL Injection	Severity: High


Overview:
---------
MYRE Real Estate Software is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL
injection vulnerabilities.


Technical Description:
----------------------
MYRE Real Estate Software is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL
injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitise user-supplied
input.

1) Input passed to the 'page' parameter in findagent.php is not properly
sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate
SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

2) Input passed to the 'country1', 'state1', and 'city1' parameters in
findagent.php is not properly verified before it is returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's
browser session in the context of a vulnerable site. This may allow the
attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch
other attacks.


Impact:
--------
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based
authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify
data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.


Affected Software:
------------------
MYRE Real Estate Software

Proof of Concept:
-----------------
1) SQL Injection

   http://127.0.0.1/realestate/findagent.php?page='

2) XSS

(a) http://127.0.0.1/realestate/findagent.php?country1=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
(b) http://127.0.0.1/realestate/findagent.php?country1=&state1=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
(c) http://127.0.0.1/realestate/findagent.php?country1=&state1=&city1=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
