The Toolbox theme for WordPress is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

An attacker can exploit this issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Toolbox 1.4 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
