AzDGDatingPlatinum is reported prone to multiple vulnerabilities.

The following specific issues were identified:

- Multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities. These issues could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in the modification of query logic or other attacks. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

- A cross-site scripting issue. An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

AzDGDatingPlatinum 1.1.0 is reported vulnerable. Other versions may be affected as well.
