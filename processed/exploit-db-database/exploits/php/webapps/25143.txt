Invision Power Board is reported prone to a JavaScript injection vulnerability. It is reported that the SML Code 'COLOR' tag is not sufficiently sanitized of malicious script content.

Since this could permit an attacker to inject hostile JavaScript into the forum system, it is possible to steal cookie credentials or misrepresent site content.

This vulnerability is reported to affect Invision Power Board version 1.3.1; previous versions might also be affected.

Invision Power Board 2.0.3 is also reported vulnerable to this issue.
