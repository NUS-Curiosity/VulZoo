Falcon Series One is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. These issues include a remote file-include vulnerability and multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities.

Exploiting these issues can allow attacker-supplied HTML or script code to run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Falcon Series One 1.4.3 stable is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
