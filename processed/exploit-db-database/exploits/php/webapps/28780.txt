Softerra PHP Developer Library is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

This issue affects version 1.5.3; previous versions are affected as well.
