mcNews is a set of scripts for allowing users to post news stories on a webpage. It will run on most Linux and Unix variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.

mcNews does not sufficiently filter dot-dot-slash (../) sequences from URL parameters. As a result, a remote attacker can disclose the contents of arbitrary web-readable files that exist on a host running the vulnerable software.
