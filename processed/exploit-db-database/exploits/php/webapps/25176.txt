PBLang is reported prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. It is reported that the issue exists due to a lack of sufficient sanitization performed on user-supplied input.

A remote attacker may exploit this condition to reveal the contents of web server readable files. Reports indicate that this will allow a remote attacker to reveal account information for target users including the password hash.
