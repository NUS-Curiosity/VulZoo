Tunez is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities.

The application is affected by an SQL injection vulnerability and a cross-site scripting issue.

Successful exploitation of the SQL injection issue could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

The cross-site scripting issue may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.
