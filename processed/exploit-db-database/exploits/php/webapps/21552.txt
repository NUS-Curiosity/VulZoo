PHP Classifieds has been reported to be prone to cross-site scripting attacks. Attackers may inject arbitrary HTML or script code into URI parameters in a malicious link. When the malicious link is visited, the attacker's script code will be executed in the web client of the user browsing the link, in the security context of the website hosting the vulnerable software.
