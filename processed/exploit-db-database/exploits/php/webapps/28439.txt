HLstats is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Version 1.34 is reportedly affected by this issue; other versions may also be affected.
