CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF vulnerability in Multisite Post Duplicator could allow an attacker to do almost anything an admin user can do

Vulnerability
================
Contains a CSRF vulnerability which can copy content from one site of a multisite installation to another.
This could be used to add arbitrary HTML to the front-end of the site (which could be used for defacement, harvesting login credentials from authenticated users, or could be used to do virtually anything a logged-in admin user can do).
This could also be used to view content not meant to be published.

Proof of concept
================
Some of these values may need adjusting depending on the post IDs, blog IDs, etc.
