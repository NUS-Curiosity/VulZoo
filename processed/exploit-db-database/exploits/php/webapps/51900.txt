## Title: WEBIGniter v28.7.23 XSS
## Author: RedTeamer IT Security, Mesut Cetin
## Date: 09/04/2023
## Vendor: https://webigniter.net/
## Software: https://webigniter.net/demo
## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/stored

## Description:
During the user creation process, the 'your_name' parameter fails to adequately validate user input, rendering the system vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

## PoC
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "your_name" parameter under https://webigniter.net/create-account during the user creation process. This code, when embedded within an image tag like this: <img src onerror="prompt(8)">, can be executed when the user navigates to the "users" page under their profile.

## Mitigation
To mitigate this risk, the "your_name" parameter should be subjected to rigorous input validation and encoding to ensure that all user input is sanitized and rendered harmless.
