Planet Script is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This can allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Planet Script 1.3 and prior are vulnerable.
