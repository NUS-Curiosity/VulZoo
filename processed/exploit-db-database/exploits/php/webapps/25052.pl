Siteman is reported prone to a vulnerability that may allow users to gain elevated privileges. This issue results from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data.

Apparently, an attacker can supply additional lines to the stream used to write to the user database file through a URI parameter. This can allow the attacker to corrupt the user database file and potentially gain administrative privileges to the Siteman application.

Siteman 1.1.10 and prior versions are affected by this vulnerability.
