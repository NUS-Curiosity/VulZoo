Open Constructor is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Open Constructor 3.12.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
