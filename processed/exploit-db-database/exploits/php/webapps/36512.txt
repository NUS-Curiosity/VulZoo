eFront is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Successfully exploiting the issue may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

eFront 3.6.10 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
