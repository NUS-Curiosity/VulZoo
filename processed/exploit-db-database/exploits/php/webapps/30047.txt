vBulletin is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Note that the attacker must have authenticated access to the affected application.

This issue is reported to affect vBulletin 3.6.6 and prior versions.
