A SQL injection vulnerability has been reported for phpBB systems.

phpBB, in some cases, does not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input, which is used when constructing SQL queries to execute on the underlying database. As a result, it is possible to manipulate SQL queries. This may allow a remote attacker to modify query logic or potentially corrupt the database.

SQL injection attacks may also potentially be used to exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
