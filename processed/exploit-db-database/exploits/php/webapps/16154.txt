# Version: Horde 3.3.2
# Tested on: linux
# CVE : CVE-2009-0932

The original disclosure was done by Gunnar Wrobel from Horde team.. it was
found in a code audit (january 2009).
It's an old vuln(2009) but still unpublished in exploit-db. There is a lot
of vulnerables sites out there. Just try google =)


Vuln description:
The version of Horde, Horde Groupware, or Horde Groupware Webmail Edition
installed on the remote host fails to filter input to the 'driver' argument
of the  'Horde_Image::factory' method before using it to include PHP code in
'lib/Horde/Image.php'.  Regardless of PHP's 'register_globals' and
'magic_quotes_gpc' settings, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this
issue to view arbitrary files or possibly to execute arbitrary PHP code on
the remote host, subject to the privileges of the web server user id.


Fix:
If using Horde, upgrade to version 3.3.3 / 3.2.4 or later. If using Horde
Groupware, upgrade to version 1.2.2 / 1.1.5 or later. If using Horde
Groupware Webmail Edition, upgrade to version 1.2.2/1.1.5 or later.
