AOblogger is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

- compromise the application
- access, modify, or create data
- steal cookie-based authentication credentials.

An attacker may also be able to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation and to launch other attacks.

Version 2.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
