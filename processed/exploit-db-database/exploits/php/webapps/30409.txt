Date published: 2013-12-05
Date of last update: 2013-12-05
Vendors contacted: SonarQube and Jenkins CI
Discovered by: Christian Catalano
Severity: High


2. ###  Vulnerability Information ###

CVE reference     : CVE-2013-5676
CVSS v2 Base Score: 9.0
CVSS v2 Vector    : (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Class             : plain text password


3. ### Introduction ###

Jenkins CI is an extendable open source continuous integration server
http://jenkins-ci.org.

Jenkins SonarQube Plugin  allows you to trigger SonarQube analysis
from Jenkins CI using either a:

- Post-build action to trigger the analysis with Maven

http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Jenkins+Plugin


4. ### Vulnerability Description ###

The default installation and configuration of Jenkins SonarQube Plugin
in Jenkins CI is prone to a security vulnerability.

This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote attacker (a jenkins
malicious user with Manage Jenkins enabled) to obtain the SonarQube's
credentials.


5. ### Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code ###

Below is a harmless test that can be executed to check if a Jenkins
SonarQube Plugin installation is vulnerable.

Using a browser with a web proxy go to the following URL:

https://jenkinsserver:9444/jenkins/configure

check the parameter "sonar.sonarPassword" in Sonar installations section.

A vulnerable installation will show the password in plain text.


6. ### Business Impact ###

An attacker (a jenkins malicious user with Manage Jenkins enabled) can
obtain the SonarQube's credentials.


7. ### Systems Affected ###

This vulnerability was tested against:
Jenkins CI v1.523 and SonarQube Plugin v3.7
Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


8. ### Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds ###

There is the ability to encrypt the "sonar.password" property with the
SonarQube encryption mechanism:

http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Settings+Encryption

The sonar.password property is only encryptable since SonarQube v3.7
