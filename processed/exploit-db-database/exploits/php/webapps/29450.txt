Ezboxx is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. The vulnerabilities include an SQL-injection issue, multiple cross-site scripting issues, and a path-disclosure issue.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, retrieve sensitive information, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerability in the underlying database implementation.

Ezboxx Portal System Beta v 0.7.6 and prior versions are vulnerable.

An attacker can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user into following a malicious URI.

The following proof-of-concept URIs are available:
http://www.example.com/ezboxx/custom/piczoom.asp?pic=[XSS]
http://www.example.com/ezboxx/boxx/user-upload.asp?nocatname=[XSS] - Login required
http://www.example.com/ezboxx/indexes/newscomments.asp?iid=[XSS]
