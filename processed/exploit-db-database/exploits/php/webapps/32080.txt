CreaCMS is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues can allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

CreaCMS 1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
