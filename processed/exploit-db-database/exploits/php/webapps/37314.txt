The Yellow Duck Framework is prone to a local file-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to adequately validate user-supplied input.

Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from local files on computers running the vulnerable application. This may aid in further attacks.

Yellow Duck Framework Beta1 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
