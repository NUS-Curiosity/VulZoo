It is reported that VoteBox is affected by a remote PHP file include vulnerability. This issue is due in part to the application failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'votebox.php' script.

Remote attackers could potentially exploit this issue to include and execute a remote malicious PHP script.

This issue reportedly affects VoteBox version 2.0, previous versions might also be affected.
