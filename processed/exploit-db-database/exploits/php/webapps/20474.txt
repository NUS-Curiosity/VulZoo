=====================
Vulnerability Details
=====================

The RSVP form does not properly sanitize input fields, allowing for XSS.

     Example:

          <script>alert(/xss/)</script>

Plugin appears to escape apostrophes and quotes, but this can easily be circumvented.

XSS will fire when the admin views the event's attendance list in the RSVP report section.
