CommuniGate Pro is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to run HTML and script code in the context of the affected site, to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to CommuniGate Pro 5.2.15 are vulnerable.
