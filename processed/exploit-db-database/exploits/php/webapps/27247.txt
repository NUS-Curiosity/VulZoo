The e107 content management system (CMS) Chatbox Plugin is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be executed in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing for the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Place the following into the Chatbox:

<script>alert("xss vuln found by ssteam")</script>
