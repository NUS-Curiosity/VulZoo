Wiki Web Help is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code could run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

Wiki Web Help 0.2.7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example URI and input are available:

Cross-site scripting:

http://www.example.com/revert.php?rev=%3Cscript%3Ealert(0)%3C/script%3E

HTML Injection:

<div onmouseover="alert(0)" style="margin:-500px;width:9999px;height:9999px;position:absolute;"></div>
