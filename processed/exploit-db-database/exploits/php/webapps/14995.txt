# Exploit Title: Joomla Component Mosets Tree 2.1.5 Shell Upload
Vulnerability
# Date: 6 September 2010
# Author: jdc
# Software Link: http://www.mosets.com/tree/
# Version: 2.1.5
# Patched: 2.1.6
# Tested on: PHP5, MySQL5

Mosets Tree suffers from a shell upload vulnerabilty caused by
improperly checking the filetype of uploaded images.

Tools used:
-----------
1. Firefox web browser
2. Firebug extension
3. GIMP image editor

Steps to Reproduce:
-------------------
1. Open GIMP, create a new image.
2. Save image as a GIF file, with the shell as the comment (surrounded
by <?php ?> tags).
3. Rename GIF to shell.gif.php
4. Create an account on the target site
5. Navigate to the mtree entry form
6. Fill out all mandatory form fields
7. At the bottom of the form you should be able to add images. Add your
shell.
8. Open Firebug and navigate to the Console tab
9. At the bottom of the console, type this in & hit enter:

(document.getElementById('adminForm')).submit();

10. After the form submits, you should be on your user listing page
11. Navigate to
http://{target}/components/com_mtree/img/listings/o/{id}.php where {id}
is the id number of your new entry

Caveats:
--------
* Requires a registered account
* The shell will have GIF garbage before the PHP code, so headers will
already be sent...
* Works if image processing is set to GD or ImageMagick. NetPbm untested.
