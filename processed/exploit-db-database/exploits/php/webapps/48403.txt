# Version: 1.0
# Tested On: Windows 10 Pro 1909 (x64_86) + XAMPP 7.4.4
# Vulnerability Info:
#   Online Scheduling System v1.0 suffers from an authenticated persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability. This Proof of Concept (PoC) will cause all users of the system,  with read access to the courses, to execute arbitrary client-side code when viewing the 'Home' and 'List' tabs within the web application. The application fails to sanitize arguments supplied by the user before inserting them into the SQL database.

# Vulnerable Source Code
## /add.cor.php
 14  $Course_Code = $_POST['corcode'];
 15  $Course_name = $_POST['corname'];
 16
 17  $sql = "INSERT INTO course (Course_Code, Course_name) VALUES ('$Course_Code', '$Course_name')";

# Malicious POST Request
