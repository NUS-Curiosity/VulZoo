PhotoGal is prone to a remote file include vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation of this issue will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the Web server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access.

Reports indicate that this issue may have been addressed in version 1.0, but this has not been confirmed.
