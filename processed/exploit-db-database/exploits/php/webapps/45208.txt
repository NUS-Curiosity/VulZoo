Vendor description:
-------------------
"Pimcore is an award-winning consolidated open source enterprise platform for
master data management (PIM/MDM), user experience management (CMS/UX), digital
asset management (DAM) and eCommerce."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch for most identified issues, but XSS will not be fixed
according to the vendor.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is highly
advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1. SQL Injection (CVE-2018-14058)
Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities have been identified in the REST web
service API. An attacker who obtains a valid API key that is granted a
necessary permission could successfully perform an attack to extract
information from the database.

2. Stored Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2018-14059)
Multiple stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been identified
across multiple functions in the application, which allows an authenticated
attacker to insert arbitrary JavaScript code in virtually all text fields and
data entries in the application.

3. Cross-site Request Forgery (CVE-2018-14057)
Multiple functions in the application are not protected by the existing
anti-CSRF token, which allows an attacker to perform a cross-site request
forgery attack to at least add, update or delete entries, among other actions.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1. SQL Injection (CVE-2018-14058)
The following URLs demonstrate the issue:
http://<host>/webservice/rest/asset-count?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/asset-inquire?apikey=[...]&id=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/asset-list?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/document-count?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/document-inquire?apikey=[...]&id=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/document-list?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/object-count?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/object-inquire?apikey=[...]&id=<SQL Injection>
http://<host>/webservice/rest/object-list?apikey=[...]&condition=<SQL Injection>

Note that a valid API key that is granted at least either "Assets", "Documents"
or "Objects" permission is required to perform an SQL injection attack against
associated API endpoints successfully.


2. Stored Cross-site Scripting (CVE-2018-14059)
Most of the text fields in pop-up dialogs and data entries in the application
are vulnerable to the cross-site scripting vulnerability, which can be
exploited by an authenticated attacker. For example, the attacker could insert
an attack payload while performing at least the following actions:

1) Edit a user account's first name/last name/e-mail address.
2) Edit a Document Types/Predefined Properties/Predefined Asset Metadata/
Quantity Value/Static Routes entry value in the table.
3) Rename an Assets/Data Objects/Video Thumbnails/Image Thumbnails/
Field-Collections/Objectbrick/Classification Store item.


The vendor stated that many identified XSS issues only affect administrative
functions and hence the issues will not be fixed:
"They are only affecting administrative functionalities (higher privileges
required) - so this isn't used by non-trusted users - a check just adds
additional overhead without any benefits for security."

SEC Consult argued multiple times that XSS can still be exploited e.g. when a
higher privileged user gets attacked and the issues should be fixed nevertheless.


3. Cross-site Request Forgery (CVE-2018-14057)
The existing anti-CSRF token in the HTTP request header named
"X-pimcore-csrf-token" was found to be validated only in the "Settings >
Users / Roles" function. Therefore, an attacker could perform a cross-site
request forgery attack against virtually all other functions in order to
at least add, update and delete data without having to submit the anti-CSRF
token.

The non-exhaustive list of affected requests are listed below:
POST /admin/asset/add-asset
POST /admin/asset/add-asset-compatibility
GET /admin/asset/delete
GET /admin/asset/import-server
GET /admin/asset/import-server-files
GET /admin/asset/import-url
POST /admin/asset/import-zip
POST /admin/asset/update
GET /admin/document/add
GET /admin/document/delete
POST /admin/document/doc-types
POST /admin/email/blacklist
POST /admin/email/email-logs
POST /admin/email/save
POST /admin/hardlink/save
POST /admin/link/save
POST /admin/newsletter/save
GET /admin/object/add
POST /admin/object/save
GET /admin/object/delete
POST /admin/page/save
POST /admin/settings/metadata
POST /admin/settings/properties
POST /admin/settings/set-system
POST /admin/settings/website-settings
POST /admin/snippet/save


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been identified in Pimcore version 5.2.3 which was the
most current version at the time of discovery.
