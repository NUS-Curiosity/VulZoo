Jetbox CMS is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to include an arbitrary remote file containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Jetbox CMS version 2.1 is reported vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

This issue is undergoing further investigation to determine the validity of the vulnerability. This BID will be updated as more information becomes available.
