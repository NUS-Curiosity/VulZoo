qEngine is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before being used to include files.

An attacker can exploit this issue using directory-traversal strings to view files and execute local script code in the context of the web server process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application; other attacks are also possible.

qEngine 6.0.0 and 4.1.6 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
