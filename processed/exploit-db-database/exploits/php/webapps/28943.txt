FreeWebShop is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including a cross-site scripting issue and a local file-include issue.

An attacker can exploit these issues to view files, execute local scripts, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and launch other attacks.

FreeWebShop 2.2 and prior versions are vulnerable to these issues.
