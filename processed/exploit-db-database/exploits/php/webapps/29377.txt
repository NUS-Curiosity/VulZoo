AShop Deluxe and AShop Administration Panel are prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because they fail to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.
