Injader is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities and an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage the HTML-injection issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is viewed, and launch other attacks.

The attacker may exploit the SQL-injection issue to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Versions prior to Injader 2.1.2 are vulnerable.
