AWAuctionScript CMS is prone to the following remote vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data:

1. A remote SQL-injection vulnerability.
2. A remote file-upload vulnerability.
3. An HTML-injection vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code, upload arbitrary files, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

AWAuctionScript 1.0 is vulnerable; other version may also be affected.
