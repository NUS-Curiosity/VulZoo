Coppermine Photo Gallery has been reported prone to PHP code injection attacks.

Due to a lack of sufficient sanitization performed on user-supplied filenames that are uploaded into the Photo Gallery, an attacker may upload a malicious JPEG. The attacker may craft it in such a way that PHP code execution will occur when the image is viewed.

This attack may result in arbitrary PHP code execution in the security context of the web server that is hosting the vulnerable application.
