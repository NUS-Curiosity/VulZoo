Bitweaver is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input including multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities, and an SQL-injection vulnerability.

A successful exploit of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database. Other attacks are also possible.

Bitweaver 2.0.0 and prior versions are vulnerable to these issues.
