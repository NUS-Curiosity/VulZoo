Vulnerability title: Stored XSS vulnerability in Collabtive application
(CVE-2014-3247)
CVE: CVE-2014-3247(coordinated with cve assigning team and vendor)
Vendor: Collabtive
Product: Collabtive (Open Source Project Management Software)
Affected version: 1.12
Fixed version: 2.0
Reported by: Deepak Rathore
Severity: Critical
URL: http://[domain]/collabtive-12/admin.php?action=addpro
Affected Users: Authenticated users
Affected parameter(s): desc

Issue details: The value of the desc request parameter is copied into the
HTML document as plain text between tags. The payload 1c91c<img%20src%3da
%20onerror%3dalert(1) >cc245622da6 was submitted in the desc parameter.
This input was echoed as 1c91c<img src=a onerror=alert(1) >cc245622da6 in
the application's response.  This proof-of-concept attack demonstrates that
it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application's
response. The proof-of-concept attack demonstrated uses an event handler to
introduce arbitrary JavaScript into the document.

HTTP request:

Steps to replicate:
1. Login into application
2. Go to "Desktop" tab and click on "Add project"
3. Fill the project details in the project form and click on "Add" button
4. Intercept request by interception proxy i.e. OWASP Zap, Burp Suite etc
5. Replace "desc" parameter value with "1c91c<img%20src%3da
%20onerror%3dalert(1) >cc245622da6"
6. Forward manipulated request to server and wait for response in browser
7. A popup with alert message will come that is the proof of vulnerability.

Tools used: Burp Suite proxy, Mozilla Firefox browser
