CMS Touch is prone to multiple SQL-injection and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

Successful exploits could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

CMS Touch 2.01 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
