PECL Alternative PHP Cache is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

Alternative PHP Cache 3.1.1 and 3.0.19 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

A malicious user with local write access (such as an FTP user on shared
hosting environments) may create two directories
  </
  a><script>alert("XSS")</
and create a file named
  script>.php
in the latter directory, then access this file via HTTP.
