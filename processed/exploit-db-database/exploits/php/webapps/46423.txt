# SQL Injection
Links:
  - https://site.com/location.php?type=byId&id=[INT]&childLevel=[INT]&level=[SQLi]
  - https://site.com/sitemgr/login.php?key=[SQLi]

# Administrator Login Bypass
The login SQL injection can be useful for us to make a union SQL injection to avoid the administrator authentication and get access to the dashboard correctly. Sometimes you get a "Invalid key error", but the web application set to you correctly the cookie, if you got that error press F5 and you will be authenticated as an administrator

# File Disclosure (authenticated)
Note: only files with .php extension, but don't forget try null-byte in old php versions
