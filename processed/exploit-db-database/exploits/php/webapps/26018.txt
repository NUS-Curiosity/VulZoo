A cross-site scripting vulnerability affects Pyrox Search. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI input that will be output in dynamically generated Web pages.

An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.
