PhpAlbum.net is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability because it fails to properly validate user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the vulnerable process.

PhpAlbum.net 0.4.1-14_fix06 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
