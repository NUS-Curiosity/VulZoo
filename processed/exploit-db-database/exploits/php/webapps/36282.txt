eFront is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the software fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

eFront 3.6.10 build 11944 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
