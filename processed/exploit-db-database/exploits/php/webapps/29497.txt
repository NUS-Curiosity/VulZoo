Easebay Resources Paypal Subscription Manager is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. The vulnerabilities include an SQL-injection issue and a cross-site scripting issue.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, retrieve sensitive information, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerability in the underlying database implementation.
