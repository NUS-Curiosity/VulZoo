cPanel BoxTrapper is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

cPanel 11 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
