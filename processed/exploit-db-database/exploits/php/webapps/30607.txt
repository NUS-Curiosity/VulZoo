The 'bcoos' Arcade module is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

This issue affects bcoos Arcade module 1.0.10; other versions may also be affected.
