----[]- Persistent XSS: -[]----
Create a new agent account, log in and press the blue «Plus» button under
the main menu («Add Your Property» text will pop-up on hover) - you will be
redirected to https://zoner.demo-website.com/?add-property=XXXX page. Use
your payload inside «Address» input field («Local information» block),
press on the «Create Property» button and check your payload on the
https://zoner.demo-website.com/author/agentm0ze/?profile-page=my_properties
page. Your new property must be approved by admin, so this is a good point
to steal some cookies :)

Payload Sample: "><img src=x onerror=alert('Greetings from m0ze')>

PoC: log in as agentm0ze:WhgZbOUH (login/password) and go to the
https://zoner.demo-website.com/author/agentm0ze/?profile-page=my_properties
page.

Create a new agent account, log in and create a new property. Then go to
the
https://zoner.fruitfulcode.com/author/aaaagent/?profile-page=my_properties
page and pay attention to the trash icon under your property info. Open the
developers console and check out this code: <a title="Delete Property"
href="#" data-toggle="modal" class="delete-property"
data-propertyid="XXX"><i class="delete fa fa-trash-o"></i></a>. Edit the
data-propertyid="XXX" attribute by typing instead of XXX desired post or
page ID which you want to delete (you can get post/page ID on the <body>
tag class -> postid-494, so attribute for post with ID 494 will be
data-propertyid="494"). After you edit the ID, click on the trash icon and
confirm deletion (POST
https://zoner.fruitfulcode.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=delete_property_act&property_id=494&security=1304db23f0).
Funny fact that you can delete ANY post & page (!) you want, security key
is not unique for each requests so it's possible to erase all pages and
posts within a few minutes.
