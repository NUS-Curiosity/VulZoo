The 'wwwstats' program is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to execute HTML and script code in the context of the affected site, to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to wwwstats 3.22 are vulnerable.
