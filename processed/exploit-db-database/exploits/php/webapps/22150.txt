A file disclosure vulnerability has been reported for W-Agora. It has been reported that W-Agora does not adequately sanitize some user-supplied input.

An attacker can construct a URL consisting of dot-dot-slash (../) character sequences to obtain access to files outside of the document root. It should be noted that only files accessible by the web server will be disclosed to the attacker.
