PHP-Nuke is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

PHP-Nuke 8.0.0.3.3b is vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.
