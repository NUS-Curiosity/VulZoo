# CVE : CVE-2022-47875


Introduction
=================
A Directory Traversal vulnerability in /be/erpc.php allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must have the permissions to upload files.


Write-Up
=================
See [Docs Syslifters](https://docs.syslifters.com/) for a detailed write-up on how to exploit vulnerability.


Proof of Concept
=================
1) This vulnerability can be exploited by first uploading a file using one of the existing file upload mechanisms (e.g. Import in Designer). When uploading a file, the web application returns the file system path in the JSON body of the HTTP response (look for `fspath`).

2) Upload a PHP file and note the file system path (`fspath`)

3) Get RCE via Directory Traversal

	PATH: /be/erpc.php?c=../../../../../fspath/of/uploaded/file/rce.php
	METHOD: POST
