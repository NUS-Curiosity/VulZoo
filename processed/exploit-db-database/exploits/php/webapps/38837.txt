1. Description

Any registered user can execute remote javascript code by sending a
private message to another user. The malicious JS code has to
be written in the title of the message, and the receiver must have
enabled the notifications when a new message is delivered.
Note that the code will be directly executed as soon as the notification
appear. (The receiver doesn't even need to check his
inbox).

2. Proof of Concept

Register on the forum (IP.Board) of a website as a regular user, and
send a message to any user having the message notifications
enabled. In the title field (and only here), a simple
<script>alert(1)</script> will show a dialog box to the victim.

3. Solution:

Patch the vulnerability with the (incoming) associated patch.
