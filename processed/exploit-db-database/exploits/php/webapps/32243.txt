Nukeviet is prone to an authentication-bypass vulnerability because it fails to adequately verify user-supplied input used for cookie-based authentication.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrative access to the affected application.

Nukeviet 2.0 Beta is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
