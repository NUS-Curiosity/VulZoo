Achievo is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to Achievo 1.4.0 are affected.
