Virtual Hosting Control System is prone to cross-site scripting attacks.

The vulnerability arises when error messages are rendered and could let an attacker inject hostile HTML and script code into the browser session of another user in the context of the site hosting the application. This could allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.
