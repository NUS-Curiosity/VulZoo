The AutartiTarot component for Joomla! is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting the issue may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

NOTE: Successful exploitation requires having 'Public Back-end' group credentials.
