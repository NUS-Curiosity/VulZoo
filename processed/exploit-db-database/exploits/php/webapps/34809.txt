Tausch Ticket Script is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Tausch Ticket Script 3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
