AzDG Dating Gold is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute an arbitrary remote file containing malicious script code in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system. Other attacks are also possible.

AzDG Dating Gold 3.0.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
