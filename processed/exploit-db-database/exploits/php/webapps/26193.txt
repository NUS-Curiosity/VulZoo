SaveWebPortal is prone to multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a loss of confidentiality and integrity. Information obtained may aid in further attacks against the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

An attacker can also execute arbitrary local PHP files through exploitation of this vulnerability. The impact of this will depend on the PHP files available.
