Anantasoft Gazelle CMS is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Anantasoft Gazelle CMS 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
