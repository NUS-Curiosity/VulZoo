Open Source SIEM (OSSIM) is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue can allow an attacker to gain access to arbitrary system files. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

Open Source SIEM (OSSIM) 4.3.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
