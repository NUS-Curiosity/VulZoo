GL-SH Deaf Forum is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks. The attacker can exploit the file-upload issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the webserver.

GL-SH Deaf Forum 6.5.5 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
