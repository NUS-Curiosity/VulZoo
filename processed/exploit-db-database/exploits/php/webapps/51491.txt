## Exploit Title: SCRMS 2023-05-27 1.0 - Multiple SQLi
## Author: nu11secur1ty
## Date: 05.27.2023
## Vendor: https://github.com/oretnom23
## Software: https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15895/simple-customer-relationship-management-crm-system-using-php-free-source-coude.html
## Reference: https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection

## Description:
The `email` parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection
attacks. The test payloads 45141002' or 6429=6429-- and 37491017' or
5206=5213-- were each submitted in the email parameter. These two
requests resulted in different responses, indicating that the input is
being incorporated into a SQL query in an unsafe way. The attacker can
easily steal all users and their passwords for access to the system.
Even if they are strongly encrypted this will get some time, but this
is not a problem for an attacker to decrypt if, if they are not enough
strongly encrypted.

STATUS: HIGH Vulnerability
