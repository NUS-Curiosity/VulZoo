Mantis is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues involve cross-site scripting, HTML injection and variable poisoning, and are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to have arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.

Successful exploitation of the HTML injection issue could result in having attacker-supplied HTML and script code executed in the context of the affected Web site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

The variable poisoning issue could result in unauthorized access and denial of service attacks.
