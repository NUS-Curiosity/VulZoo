Multiple vulnerabilities were reported to exist in PostNuke Phoenix. The following specific vulnerabilities were reported:

- Multiple path disclosure vulnerabilities that occur when a user directly requests scripts in the "/includes/blocks/" and "pnadodb" directories. This issue also affects scripts that are associated in multiple modules.

- Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were reported in the Downloads and Web_Links modules as well as the openwindow.php script. These issues may permit remote attackers to cause hostile HTML and script code to be interpreted by a victim user's browser.
