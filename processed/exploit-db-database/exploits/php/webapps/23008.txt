DCForum+ is prone to an HTML injection vulnerability. An attacker may exploit this issue by including hostile HTML and script code in the subject field of posts to the bulletin board. This is because the script that processes posts does not sufficiently sanitize user input, allowing attackers to embed HTML and script commands within the post. This code may be rendered in the web browser of a user who views these areas of the site. This would occur in the security context of the site hosting DCForum+.
