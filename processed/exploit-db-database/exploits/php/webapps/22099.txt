Introduction:
=============
CMSQLite is a small, fast, flexible and complete Content-Management-System (CMS). It s perfect for freelancers, self-employeds,
clubs and associations and small companies. CMSQLite is a CMS, basing on PHP and SQLite. That has many advantages! Comfortable Editor.

language, too. Simple Handling CMSQLite is especially developed for users, who don t want to learn much about CMS. The backend structure
is simple and a few menu items make work easy and simple.

Abstract:
=========
An independent Laboratory Researcher discovered multiple web vulnerabilities  in the CMSQLITE v1.3.2 Content Management System.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-10-18:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
A local file include vulnerability is detected in the CMSQLITE v1.3.2 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows a local privileged user account to include and load local system files. The vulnerability
is located in the mediaAdmin.php file with the bound vulnerable d parameter request. Successful exploitation of the
vulnerability results in a web server compromise via file load (webshell) or information disclosure via local system file include.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] mediaAdmin.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] d=


1.2
A client side cross site scripting vulnerability is detected in the CMSQLITE v1.3.2 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) to hijack customer/moderator/admin sessions with medium required
user inter action. The security vulnerability is located in the mediaAdmin.php file with the bound vulnerable
d parameter request. Successful exploitation can result in account steal, client side phishing attacks, client
side malware load, external redirects or stable client side module context manipulation.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                [+] mediaAdmin.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
                                [+] ?id=


1.3
Multiple client side cross site request forgery vulnerabilities are detected in the CMSQLITE v1.3.2 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) to form malicious webpages to execute application functions on client side requests
with not expired application session. The security vulnerabilities are located in the deleteMenu, deleteCategory, deleteArticle,
addMenu, addCategory & addArticle modules. Successful exploitation can result in forced account add/delete and category/article
add/delete via not expired application session.


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The local file include vulnerability can be exploited by local privileged user account without required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

http://cmsqlite.127.0.0.1:8080/cmsqlite/admin/mediaAdmin.php?d=darius.php+$[NEW PATH]%00



1.2
The client side cross site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account
and with low or medium required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.3
The client side cross site request forgery vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged application user account
and with medium or high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Affected Delete Element(s): 	javascript:deleteMenu, javascript:deleteCategory & javascript:deleteArticle
Affected Add Element(s): 	javascript:addMenu, javascript:addCategory & javascript:addArticle

http://cmsqlite.127.0.0.1:8080/cmsqlite/admin/helper/deleteCategory.php


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the local file include vulnerability is estimated as high(-).

1.2
The security risk of the client site cross site scripting vulnerability is estimated as medium(-).

1.3
The security risk of the client site cross site request forgery vulnerabilties are estimated as low(+).
