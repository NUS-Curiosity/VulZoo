Xoops is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the 'myheader.php' script included in the mylinks module. A remote attacker could exploit this issue by embedding hostile HTML and script code in a malicious link to the vulnerable script. Exploitation could allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

This issue was reported in Xoops 2.0.5.1. It is likely that other versions are also affected.
