Hello Bugtraq!

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in E107. Which I
found at 31.01.2009 and disclosed recently.

XSS:

At page for sending news to email (http://site/email.php?news.1) it's
possible to conduct XSS attack via Referer header. Particularly it can be
done via flash.

Referer: '><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

Vulnerable are E107 0.7.16 and previous versions (all versions).

I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/3528/).

Best wishes & regards,
