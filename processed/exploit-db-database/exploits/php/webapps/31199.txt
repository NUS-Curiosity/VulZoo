Dokeos is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities including five SQL-injection issues, one HTML-injection issue, three cross-site scripting issues, and one arbitrary-file-upload issue.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the webserver, compromise the application, steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users of the site, modify the way the site is rendered, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Versions prior to Dokeos 1.8.4 SP2 are affected.
