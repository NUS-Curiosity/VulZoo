AFCommerce is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to obtain potentially sensitive information or to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web server process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.
