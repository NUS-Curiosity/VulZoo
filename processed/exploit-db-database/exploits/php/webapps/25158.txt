OOApp Guestbook is reportedly affected by multiple HTML injection vulnerabilities. These issues occur because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

The attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be able to access properties of the site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user, other attacks are also possible.
