OpenBiblio is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data. The issues include SQL-injection, cross-site scripting, HTML-injection, and local file-include vulnerabilities.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, execute arbitrary local scripts, retrieve potentially sensitive information, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

These issues affect Openbiblio 0.5.2-pre4 and prior versions.
