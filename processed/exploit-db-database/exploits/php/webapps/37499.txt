Phonalisa is prone to multiple HTML-injection, cross-site-scripting, and arbitrary code-execution vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code in the context of the web server, compromise the affected application, or steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users of the site. Other attacks are also possible.

Phonalisa 5.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
