It is reported that Fusion News is affected by an administrator command execution vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly validate access to administrative commands.

This issue permits a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link or embed a malicious URI between bbCode image tags, which includes hostile HTML and script code. If an unsuspecting forum administrator activates this URI, the attacker-supplied command would be carried out with the administrator's privileges. This occurs in the security context of the affected web site and would cause various administrator actions to be taken.

Version 3.6.1 and prior are reported to be affected by this vulnerability.
