Bigace is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to include arbitrary remote PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process.

A successful exploit may lead to a compromise of the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Version 1.8.2 of Bigace is known to be vulnerable; previous versions may be affected as well.
