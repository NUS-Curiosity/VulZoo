## Description:
The location_id parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection
attacks. A single quote was submitted in the location_id parameter,
and a database error message was returned. Two single quotes were then
submitted and the error message disappeared.
The attacker easily can steal all information from the database of
this web application!
WARNING! All of you: Be careful what you buy! This will be your responsibility!
