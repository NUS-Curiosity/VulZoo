Pretty Link Lite plugin for WordPress is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits will allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Pretty Link Lite 1.5.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
