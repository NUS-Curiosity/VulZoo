It has been reported that LedForums is prone to a HTML injection vulnerability that may allow an attacker to execute HTML code in a user's browser. The issue is reported to be present in the 'top_message' and 'topic' fields. This problem is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

LedForums Beta 1 has been reported to be vulnerable to this issue.
