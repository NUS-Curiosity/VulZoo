PBLang is prone to multiple HTML injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be executed in the context of the affected Web site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Other similar HTML injection issues have been documented for PBLang version 4.65. This issue may be related to those documented in the following BIDs:
- 14728, PBLang Bulletin Board System Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities
- 14766, PBLang Bulletin Board System HTML Injection Vulnerability
