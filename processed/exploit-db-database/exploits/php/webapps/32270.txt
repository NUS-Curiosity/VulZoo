Freeway is prone to multiple local file-include vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities using directory-traversal strings to view local files in the context of the webserver process. This may aid in further attacks.

Freeway 1.4.1.171 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
