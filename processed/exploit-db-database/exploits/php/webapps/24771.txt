A vulnerability is reported in the KorWeblog software that may allow a remote user to disclose directory listings.

The problem presents itself when a malicious user crafts an URI request containing directory traversal sequences. When properly formatted, the request will present the malicious user with a listing of the contents of a specified server directory located outside of the web root.

An attacker may leverage this issue to gain access to sensitive information by disclosing directory listings; information disclosed in this way could lead to further attacks against the target system.
