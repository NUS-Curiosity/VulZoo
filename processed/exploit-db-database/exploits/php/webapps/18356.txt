Introduction:

Tine 2.0 is an open source project which combines groupware and CRM in
one consistent interface. Tine 2.0 is web-based
and optimises collaboration and organisation of groups in a lasting
manner. Tine 2.0 unites all the advantages of open
source software with an extraordinarily high level of usability and an
equally high standard of professional software
development. This is what makes the difference between Tine 2.0 and
many other existing groupware solutions.
Tine 2.0 includes address book, calendar, email, tasks, time tracking
and CRM. Intelligent functions and links make
collaboration in Tine 2.0 a true pleasure and include:

    Synchronising mobile telephones, such as iPhone, Android, Nokia
and Windows Mobile
