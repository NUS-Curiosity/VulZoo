1)  You need permissions to publish a post from the public interface:

    The submission form is not well sanitized and will result in stored xss
    in admin pages:

    * Name field is not sanitized and it's injectable with a payload
      which will be stored in the pending submission page in admin panel
      POC: myname'"><script>window.alert(document.cookie)</script>

    * Email field is not sanitized but can it will check for a valid email address
      so the maximum result will be a reflected xss
      POC: my@mail.com'"><script>window.alert(document.cookie)</script>

    * Post Title is not sanitized and it's injectable with a payload
      which will be stored in the pending submissions page in admin panel
      POC: title'"><script>window.alert(document.cookie)</script>
