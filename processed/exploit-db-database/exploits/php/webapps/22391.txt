It has been reported that osCommerce does not sufficiently filter URI parameters supplied to multiple osCommerce scripts.

As a result of this deficiency, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user. All code will be executed within the context of the website running osCommerce.

This may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.

This vulnerability was reported to affect osCommerce version 2.2ms1, prior versions are reportedly affected.
