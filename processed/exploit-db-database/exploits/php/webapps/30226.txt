eNdonesia is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify sensitive data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

eNdonesia 8.4 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
