Amateur Photographer's Image Gallery is prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, a cross-site scripting vulnerability, and an arbitrary file-disclosure vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database, and obtain sensitive information from local files on computers running the vulnerable application.

Amateur Photographer's Image Gallery 0.9a is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
