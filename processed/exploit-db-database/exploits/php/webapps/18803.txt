Abstract:
=========
A Vulnerability Laboratory Researcher Team discovered multiple Web Vulnerabilities in Opial v2 Content Management
System.



Report-Timeline:
================
2012-04-27:     Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
A remote SQL Injection vulnerability is detectedin Opial v2 Content Management System. The vulnerability allows
an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands on the affected
application dbms.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                        [+] /albumdetail.php?albumid=
                                        [+] /admin/albumsedit.php?id=
                                        [+] /admin/albumscommentdetail.php?albumid=
                                        [+] /admin/artistsedit.php?id=
                                        [+] /admin/editmusic.php?id=
                                        [+] /admin/genresedit.php?id=


1.2
A persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in Opial v2 Content Management System. The bugs allow remote
attackers
to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent). Successful exploitation of the
vulnerability can
lead to session hijacking (manager/admin) or stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user
inter action.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                        [+] /topsearches.php?genres_parent - inject any html code in the search and
then go to top searches
                                        [+] /admin/artistsedit.php?id=9 - artist name
                                        [+] /admin/albumsedit.php?id=23 - album name
                                        [+] /admin/editmusic.php?id=39 - songs name
                                        [+] /admin/genresedit.php?id=10 - Genres name
1.3
An arbitrary file upload are detected in Opial v2 Content Management System. The bugs allow remote attackers to
upload any files that he wants. The attacker might upload malicious files, such as webshells in php.

Vulnerable Module(s):
                                        [+] /admin/artistsedit.php?id=9 - artist cover
                                        [+] /admin/albumsedit.php?id=23 - album cover
                                        [+] /admin/editmusic.php?id=39 - songs cover
                                        [+] /admin/genresedit.php?id=10 = Genres cover


Proof of Concept:
=================
The sql injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1
http://www.xxx.com/opia/albumdetail.php?albumid=-23+union+select+1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,
13,14,group_concat(admin_username,0x3a,admin_password),16+from+adminuserdetails-- -

http://www.xxx.net/opial /admin/albumsedit.php?id=23[SQL-INJECTION]


1.2
The issue can be exploited by an injection in the search  box with script code as value.
The result is the persistent execution out of the web application context. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:

"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script><div style="1


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of full SQL injection vulnerability is estimated as critical.

1.2
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as medium.

1.3
The security risk of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability is estimated as high.
