DataLife Engine is prone to multiple remote file-include vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit these issues to include an arbitrary remote file containing malicious PHP code and execute it in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

NOTE: Further information reveals that the reported vulnerable parameter is actually a constant, not a variable, so it cannot be controlled by an attacker. Since the application is not vulnerable, this BID is being retired.
