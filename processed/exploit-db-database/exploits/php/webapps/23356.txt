Mark Stanislav - mark.stanislav@gmail.com


I. DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------
portable-phpMyAdmin doesn't verify an existing WordPress session (privileged or not) when accessing the plugin file path directly. Because of how this plugin works, a default installation will provide a full phpMyAdmin console with the privilege level of the MySQL configuration of WordPress.


II. TESTED VERSION
---------------------------------------
1.3.0


III. PoC EXPLOIT
---------------------------------------
Navigate to http://host/wp-content/plugins/portable-phpmyadmin/wp-pma-mod and you will be presented with the full portable-phpMyAdmin web interface without the requirement of a session or any credential.


IV. SOLUTION
---------------------------------------
Upgrade to version 1.3.1
