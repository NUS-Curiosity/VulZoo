Geeklog is prone to HTML injection attacks.

The user account 'Homepage' field is not sufficiently sanitized of HTML and script code. As a result, a malicious user may inject malicious HTML and script code into this field. When the malicious user's account information is displayed to other web users, the attacker-supplied code will be interpreted in their web client in the security context of the site hosting the vulnerable software.
