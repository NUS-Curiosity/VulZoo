AIOCP (All In One Control Panel) is prone to a remote file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to compromise the application and the computer; other attacks are also possible.

AIOCP 1.4.001 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
