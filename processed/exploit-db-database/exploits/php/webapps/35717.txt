Exponent CMS is prone to a local file-include vulnerability and an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit these issues to upload arbitrary files onto the webserver, execute arbitrary local files within the context of the webserver, and obtain sensitive information.

Exponent CMS 2.0.0 beta 1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
