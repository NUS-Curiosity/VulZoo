Web Hosting Manager is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Version 3.1.0 is vulnerable to these issue; other versions may also be affected.

Note that to exploit these issues, an attacker must have authenticated access to the affected application.
