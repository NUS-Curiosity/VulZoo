It is reported that CuteNews is affected by multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI input.

The problems present themselves when malicious HTML and script code is sent to the application through the 'id' parameter of the multiple scripts.

These issues could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link that includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user.
