-- Description --

This stored XSS vulnerability allows any logged in user
to inject malicious code in the comments section:
e.g. "><body onLoad=confirm("XSS")>

The vulnerability exists because the user input is not properly sanitized
and this can lead to malicious code injection that will be executed on the
targetâ€™s browser

-- Proof of Concept --

1. The attacker posts a new comment which contains our payload:
"><body onLoad=confirm("XSS")>

2. The stored XSS can be triggered when any user visits the link of the
uploaded content

-- Solution --

The vendor has fixed the issue in the version 4.21
