PHP-Nuke is a website creation/maintainence tool written in PHP3.

A PHP-Nuke feature supporting cycling ad banners is subject to interference from a remote user.

A querystring can be submitted to an unpatched server which allows the remote user to specify a new destination URL to be opened in a visitor's browser upon clicking a PHP-nuke site's ad banner.

By changing the click-through destination of a banner ad, an attacker could interfere with the target's ad-based revenue generation.

To change the url of the first banner you should enter in your browser

http://target/banners.php?op=Change&bid=bannerid&url=http://where.to

if we want to change the banner number 1 to redir to

www.you_are_redir

we write

http://www.example.com/banners.php?op=Change&bid=1&url=http://you.are.redir

(where www.example.com is the server running php-nuke)
