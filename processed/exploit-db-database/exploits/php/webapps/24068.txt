It has been reported that SquirrelMail is affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the handling of folder name displays. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to including it in dynamic web content.

This issue may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.
