Fusion News is prone to an access validation error allowing a user to add arbitrary user/administrator accounts through manipulating URI parameters.

Successful exploitation of this error may allow a user to compromise a vulnerable system by gaining administrative privileges.

The problem is reported to be present in Fusion News 3.3, however older versions may be vulnerable as well.
