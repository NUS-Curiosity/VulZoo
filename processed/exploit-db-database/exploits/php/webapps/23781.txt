MyBB <1.6.9 is vulnerable to Stored, Error based, SQL Injection.

Vulnerable code:

/editpost.php

===
Line 398
===
$posthash_query = "posthash='{$posthash}' OR ";
===


It can be done by using Tamper Data(Or Live HTTP Headers), and when
submitting a post, edit the 'posthash' POST parameter to your payload,
submitting, then going to edit your post.
