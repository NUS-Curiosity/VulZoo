Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities  are detected in the Event Script PHP v1.1 Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an attacker (remote) or local low privileged user account to inject/execute own sql commands
on the affected application dbms without user inter action. The vulnerabilities are located in the eventscript.php
file and the bound parameters p & id. The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without
user inter action & without privileged user account. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in dbms
& application compromise.


Vulnerable File(s):
        [+] eventscript.php

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
        [+] ?p=
        [+] ?id=


Proof of Concept:
=================
The sql injection vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without user inter action & without
privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

PoC:
http://127.0.0.1:1338/eventscriptphp/eventscript.php?id=-1'[SQL-INJECTION]--
http://127.0.0.1:1338/eventscriptphp/eventscript.php?p=-1'[SQL-INJECTION]--


Risk:
