MKPortal is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

This issue affects MKPortal M1.1 RC1; other versions may also be vulnerable.
