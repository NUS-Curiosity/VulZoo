today i found some major security problem. the issue can be found at all integramod 1.4.x versions.
explanation of the issue:

all integramod versions do have a backup folder where the daily database backups are stored. the coders
of integramod forgott to secure this folder.

example:
just head to the official page of integramod www.integramod.com. you are being redirected
to http://www.integramod.com/forum/ . now just head into the backup folder: http://www.integramod.com/forum/backup.
As you can see you have full access to all database backups!
-> www.pagename/installpath/backup/ directly leads to the database backups!
notice: some versions do have a index.html in the folder but it is easy to get the backups any way
bacause they are alway stored in the dame format:
backup-yyyy-dd-mm.sql
