Facil Helpdesk is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including a cross-site scripting vulnerability, a local file-include vulnerability, and a remote file-include vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, obtain potentially sensitive information, execute local script code in the context of the application, or to execute arbitrary code within the context of the webserver process; other attacks are also possible.

Facil Helpdesk 2.3 Lite is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
