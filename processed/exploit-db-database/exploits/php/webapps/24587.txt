Reportedly the PostNuke Modules Factory Subjects module is affected by a remote SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI parameters.

An attacker might exploit this issue to manipulate SQL queries carried out against the database; it may be possible to disclose sensitive information such as the administrator password hash, as well as corrupt arbitrary data. SQL injection issues may also facilitate attacks against latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
