VOXTRONIC Voxlog Professional is prone to a file-disclosure vulnerability and multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An remote attacker can exploit these issues to obtain potentially sensitive information from local files on computers running the vulnerable application, or modify the logic of SQL queries. A successful exploit may allow the attacker to compromise the software, retrieve information, or modify data; These may aid in further attacks.

VOXTRONIC Voxlog Professional 3.7.2.729 and 3.7.0.633 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
