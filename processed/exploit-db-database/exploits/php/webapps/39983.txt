[+] ISR: APPARITIONSEC


Vendor:
====================
www.getsymphony.com


Product:
==================

Download:

Symphony is a XSLT-powered open source content management system.


Vulnerability Type:
===================
Session Fixation


CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2016-4309


Vulnerability Details:
=====================

Symphony CMS is prone to "Session Fixation" allowing attackers to preset a
users PHPSESSID "Session Identifier".
If the application is deployed using an insecure setup with PHP.INI
"session.use_only_cookies" not enabled, attackers can then send
victims a link to the vulnerable application with the "PHPSESSID" already
initialized as Symphony does not use or call
"session_regenerate_id()" upon successful user authentication.

Note: as per php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php
"session.use_only_cookies=1" is default since PHP 4.3.0.

e.g.

"http://localhost/symphony/?PHPSESSID=APPARITION666".

As Symphonys Session ID is not regenerated it can result in arbitrary
Session ID being 'Fixated' to a user, if that user authenticates using
this attacker supplied session fixated link, the attacker can now access
the affected application from a different Computer/Browser
and have the same level of access to that of the victim. Default Cookie
lifetime for Symphony CMS is up to two weeks.



Reproduction steps:
=====================

Edit PHP.INI and change following settings to 'session.use_only_cookies=0'
if applicable, as POC test.


1) Telnet localhost 80

2) make HTTP request with a prefixed PHPSESSID

GET /symphony-2.6.7/symphony/?PHPSESSID=PWN3D666 HTTP/1.1
