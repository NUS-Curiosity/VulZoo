phpLiteAdmin is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

phpLiteAdmin 1.8.x and 1.9.x are vulnerable.
