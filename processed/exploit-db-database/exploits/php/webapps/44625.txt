# Exploit Author: Mattia Furlani
# CVE: CVE-2018-7465
# Category: webapps

# 1. Description
# An XSS issue was discovered in VirtueMart before 3.2.14. All the textareas in the admin area of the plugin can be closed by simply adding </textarea> to the value and saving the product/config. By editing back the product/config, the editor's browser will execute everything after the </textarea>, leading to a possible XSS.

# 2. Proof of Concept
Having the permissions to edit the config/products, you can simply write </textarea><script>alert(1)</script> inside a textarea, when someone will edit it back the alert will execute on the editor's browser

# 3. Solution: Upgrade to 3.2.14
