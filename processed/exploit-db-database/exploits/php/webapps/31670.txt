WordPress is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting the issue may allow an attacker to access sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

WordPress 2.3.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
