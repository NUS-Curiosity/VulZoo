I. ABOUT THE APPLICATION

Miniweb 2.0 is designed for those who want to transform  a
brochure  site  into  a dynamic Web 2.0 site that attracts
tons of traffic and sales.


II. DESCRIPTION

Preamble: I  don't  consider this argument a real security
flaw but it may be useful in some cases.

The value of the module parameter passed to index.php page
is  included  using  the  PHP main function. This may be a
principle  of  local file inclusion  vulnerability  but in
this  case  the  final  NULL  byte is  properly sanitised.
However an invalid module name produces a  warning message
with the full path of the interested page.


III. ANALYSIS

In  order  to  "exploit"  this  vulnerability,  you  don't
require anything.


IV. SAMPLE CODE

V. FIX

Use @main() instead of main()
