SchoolAlumni portal is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. These issues include a local file-include vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access sensitive information, execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and launch other attacks.

Version 2.26 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
