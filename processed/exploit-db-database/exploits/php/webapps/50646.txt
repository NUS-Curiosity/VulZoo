*SQL Injection*
SQL injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to it's database. Online Railway Reservation System v1.0 is vulnerable to SQL injection via the 'id' parameter on the Reservation Form.

*Attack Vector*
An attacker can compromise the database of the application using some automated(or manual) tools like SQLmap.

*Steps of reproduce:*
Step-1: Navigate to 'Schedule' > go to 'Book' or 'Revervation Form' page using the following URL:
http://localhost/orrs/?page=reserve&sid=1

Step-2: Put the SQL Injection payloads in 'id' field.
In this we used time-based blind payload: /orrs/?page=reserve&sid=1') AND (SELECT 6842 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))UsWr) AND ('WBCm'='WBCm

Step-3: Now, the Server target accepted our payload and the response got delayed by 5 seconds.
