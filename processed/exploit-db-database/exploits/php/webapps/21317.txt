Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
1.1
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in the NeoBill v0.8 Alpha Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers or local low privileged user account to inject/implement malicious persistent script
code on application side of the neobill v0.8 web application. The vulnerability is located in the user account module with
the bound vulnerable contactname or username parameters. Attackers can inject via register account or update profile malicious
persistent script codes as companyname and username. The code will be persistent executed in the administration backend when processing
to watching the user account listings. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in persistent session hijacking attacks,
persistent phishing requests & stable persistent module context manipulation.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] User Accounts - Management [Admin Backend]

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Contactname
				[+] Username


1.2
Multiple client side cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in the NeoBill v0.8 Alpha Content Management System.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker to manipulate client side application requests with medium or high required user
inter action.  The vulnerabilities are located in the unsanitized output of the Uncaught SWException & Invalid Object Exception
web application modules. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in client side session hijacking, non-persistent
phishing requests & non-persistent module context manipulation.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] 2 x Exception Handling

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Uncaught SWException Handling
				[+] Invalid Object Exception Handling


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The persistent web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with low privileged application user account and low
required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.2
The non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers without low privileged application
user account with medium or high required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerability is estimated as high.

1.2
The security risk of the non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are estimated as low(+)|(-)medium.
