Content2Web is affected by multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this lack of sanitization to perform SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting attacks and include local PHP files. It may also be possible to include remote PHP files as well; this has not been confirmed.

The consequences of these attacks vary from a compromise of the system, the execution of arbitrary code and the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, all in the context of the Web server process.
