Exploit:

Authentication is needed for this exploit. An attacker needs to login to Sitecore 8.0 revision 150802's Admin section.
When choosing to Serializeusers or domains in the admin UI, calls to /sitecore/shell/~/xaml/Sitecore.Shell.Applications.Dialogs.Progress.aspx will include a CSRFTOKEN parameter.
By replacing this parameter with a URL-encoded, base64-encoded crafted payload from ysoserial.net, an RCE is successful.
