1- Directory traversal vulnerability : For example to download the
web.config file we can send a request as the following:
http://www.example.com/Checkbox/Upload.ashx?f=..\..\web.config&n=web.config

2- Direct Object Reference :
attachments to surveys can be accessed directly without login as the
following:
https://www.victim.com/Checkbox/ViewContent.aspx?contentId=5001
I created a script that can bruteforce the numbers to find ID's that will
download the attachment and you can easily write one on your own ;).

3- Open redirection in login page for example:
https://www.victim.com/Checkbox/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=http://www.google.com

If you can't see why an open redirection is a problem in login page please
