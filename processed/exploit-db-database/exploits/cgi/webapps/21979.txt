A vulnerability has been discovered in ION Script.

By sending a malicious HTTP request to a webserver running the vulnerable ION Script package, it is possible for a remote attacker to disclose arbitrary webserver readable files. As webservers are often run with high privileges, it may be possible to disclose sensitive system files.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to gain information required to launch further attacks against the target system.

ION Script for UNIX has also been confirmed vulnerable to this issue.

It is not yet known which ION Script packages are vulnerable to this issue.
