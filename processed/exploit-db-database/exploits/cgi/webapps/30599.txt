WebBatch is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and an information-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

The attacker may leverage the information-disclosure issue to obtain potentially sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

Reports indicate that WebBatch 2007D is not affected by the cross-site scripting issue.
