Avaya Intuity Audix LX is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities, including:

1. Multiple remote command-execution vulnerabilities
2. A cross-site request-forgery vulnerability
3. A cross-site scripting vulnerability

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of 'vexvm' on the underlying system, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, execute arbitrary script code, and perform administrative tasks. Other attacks are also possible.
