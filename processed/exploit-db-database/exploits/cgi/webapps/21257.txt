Search.CGI is a component of the HTMLsearch Search Engine software distributed by AHG. The software is available for the Unix, Linux, and Microsoft platforms.

The search.cgi script included with the AHG Search Engine does not adequately filter input. Due to lack of sufficient input sanitization, it is possible for a remote user to pass semi-colon (;) and pipe (|) characters through a search request. This can result in the commands encapsulated between the symbols being executed with the privileges of the web server.
