A potential remote command execution vulnerability has been discovered in the cPanel application. This issue occurs due to insufficient sanitization of externally supplied data to the login script. An attacker may exploit this problem by crafting a malicious URI request for the affected script; the attacker may then supply shell metacharacters and arbitrary commands as a value for the affected variable.
