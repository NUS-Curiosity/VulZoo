The Zeus Web Server contains a web based administration interface that is vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks.

Due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, it is possible for an attacker to construct a malicious link which contains arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in the web client of a user who visits the malicious link. It should be noted that the user must authenticate with the administrative interface for the attack to succeed.

The vendor has stated that cookies are not used to store usernames and passwords.
