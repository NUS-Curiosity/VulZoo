It has been reported that Divine Content Server is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. The problem exists in the 'pagename' attribute in the error page of the software. This issue may allow a remote attacker to execute HTML or script code in user's browser.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks may well be possible.

Divine Content Server version 5.0 may be vulnerable to this issue, however this information cannot be confirmed at the moment.
