LemonLDAP:NG is prone to a user-enumeration weakness and a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

A remote attacker can exploit the user-enumeration weakness to enumerate valid usernames and then perform brute-force attacks; other attacks are also possible.

The attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Versions prior to LemonLDAP::NG 0.9.3.2 are vulnerable.
