Gossamer Threads Links is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.

Links versions 2.x, and 2.2.x, as well as Links-SQL version 3.0 are all reported vulnerable to this issue.
