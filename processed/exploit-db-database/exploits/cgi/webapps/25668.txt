Sigma ISP Manager is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to using it in an SQL query.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
