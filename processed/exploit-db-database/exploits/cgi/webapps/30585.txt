Axis Communications 207W Network Camera is prone to multiple vulnerabilities in the web interface. Three issues were reported: a cross-site scripting vulnerability, a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability, and a denial-of-service vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to compromise the device or to prevent other users from using the device.
