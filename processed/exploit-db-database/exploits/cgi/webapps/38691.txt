Kwok Information Server is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Kwok Information Server 2.7.3 and 2.8.4 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
