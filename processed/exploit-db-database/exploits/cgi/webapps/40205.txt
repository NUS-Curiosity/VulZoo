Title: Unauthenticated admin password change
Product: Davolink modem
Tested model: DV-2051
Vulnerability Type: Missing Function Level Access Control [CWE-306]
Risk Level: High
Solution Status: No fix available
Discovered and Provided: Eric Flokstra
===================================================================

[-] About the Product:

The Davolink DV-2051 is an ADSL modem with 4 Fast Ethernet ports,
Wireless Access Point and VoIP (2 times FXS).

[-] Advisory Details:

Basic authentication is in place to authenticate the administrative user
against the web application. To change the administrator password the
old password must be provided, which is validated by JavaScript. By
intercepting a successful password reset request the JavaScript
validation can be bypassed. It was also noticed authorisation checks are
missing on the password reset functionality. Combining these
vulnerabilities enable unauthenticated users to change the admin
password with a single request.

[-] Proof of Concept:

The following request can be used to change the admin password to the
value ’FooBar’:

192.168.1.1/password.cgi?usrPassword=FooBar

Title: Lack of CSRF protection
Product: Davolink modem
Tested model: DV-2051
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Request Forgery [CWE-352]
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: No fix available
Discovered and Provided: Eric Flokstra
========================================================

[-] About the Product:

The Davolink DV-2051 is a an ADSL modem with 4 Fast Ethernet ports,
Wireless Access Point and VoIP (2 times FXS).

[-] Advisory Details:

The web application enables users to set a password in order for clients
to connect to the SSID. Currently no measures against Cross-Site Request
Forgery have been implemented and therefore users can be tricked into
submitting requests without their knowledge or consent. From the
application's point of view these requests are legitimate requests from
the user and they will be processed as such. This can result in for
example changing the WPA2 password.

[-] Proof of Concept:

The following link can be used to trick a logged in user to set the WPA2
Pre Shared Key to ‘FooBar01’.

192.168.1.1/wlsecurity.wl?wlAuthMode=psk2&wlAuth=0&wlWpaPsk=FooBar01&wlWpaGtkRekey=0&wlNetReauth=36000&wlWep=disabled&wlWpa=tkip+aes&wlKeyBit=0&wlPreauth=0

Title: Multiple persistent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities
Product: Davolink modem
Tested model: DV-2051
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting [CWE-79]
Risk Level: Medium
Solution Status: No fix available
Discovered and Provided: Eric Flokstra
===============================================================

[-] About the Product:

The Davolink DV-2051 is a an ADSL modem with 4 Fast Ethernet ports,
Wireless Access Point and VoIP (2 times FXS).

[-] Advisory Details:

The web application enables users to add virtual servers to direct
incoming traffic from WAN side to an internal server with a private IP
address on the LAN side. It was noticed insufficient validation is
performed on several places such as the ‘srvName’ parameter which is
sent with the request when adding a new virtual server. This
vulnerability makes it possible to remotely execute arbitrary scripting
code in the target user's web browser by adding a persistent JavaScript
payload to the application.

[-] Proof of Concept:

The following request can be used as POC, it opens port 4444 to an
internal IP address. An iframe is added to the ‘srvName’ field and
displays a pop-up box.

192.168.1.1/scvrtsrv.cmd?action=add&srvName=FooBar<iframe%20onload=alert(0)>&srvAddr=192.168.1.100&proto=1,&eStart=4444,&eEnd=4444,iStart=4444,&iEnd=4444,
