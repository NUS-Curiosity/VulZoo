A vulnerability has been discovered in GNU Mailman. It has been reported that Mailman is prone to cross site scripting attacks. This is due to insufficient santization of URI parameters.


As a result, attackers may embed malicious script code or HTML into a link to a site running the vulnerable software. If such a link is followed, the attacker-supplied code will be interpreted in the web browser of the victim of the attack. It may be possible to steal the unsuspecting user's cookie-based authentication credentials, as well as other sensitive information. Other attacks are also possible.
