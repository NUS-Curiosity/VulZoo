MPKI 6.0 is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to spoof the results of certificate-validation operations in the browser of an unsuspecting user with the same certificate trust level as that of the affected site. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.
