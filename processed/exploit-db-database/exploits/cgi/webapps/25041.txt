It is reported that e_Board is vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

By including '../' directory traversal sequences and a NULL (%00) in the affected URI argument, attackers may reportedly cause the contents of arbitrary, potentially sensitive web-server readable files to be included in the output of the requested page.
