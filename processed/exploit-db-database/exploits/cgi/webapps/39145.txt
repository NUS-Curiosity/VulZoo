Xangati XSR And XNR are prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the affected application.

Xangati XSR prior to 11 and XNR prior to 7 are vulnerable.
