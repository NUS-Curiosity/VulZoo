It is reported that Linksys Web Camera software is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or carry out other attacks.

The problem presents itself when an attacker passes malicious HTML or script code to the application via the 'next_file' parameter of the 'main.cgi' script.

Linksys Web Camera software version 2.10 is reportedly prone to this issue, however, it is possible that other versions are affected as well.
