EditTag is prone to multiple directory-traversal vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues may allow a remote attacker to access any file on the affected webserver.

Version 1.2 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
