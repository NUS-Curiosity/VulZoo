Cart32 is reported prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue presents itself due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data.

A remote attacker can exploit this issue by creating a malicious link to the vulnerable application that includes hostile HTML and script code. If a user follows this link, the hostile code renders in the web browser of the victim user. Theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks is possible.

Cart32 version 5.0 and prior are considered prone to this issue.
