It is reported that LinuxStat is vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

By including '../' directory traversal sequences in the affected URI argument, attackers may reportedly cause the contents of arbitrary, potentially sensitive web-server readable files to be included in the output of the requested page. The resulting information disclosure may aid malicious users in further attacks.

Versions prior to 2.3.1 are reported to be affected by this vulnerability.
