Product & Service Introduction:
========================
Mailspect is the email security and archiving brand of RAE Internet Inc., Tarrytown, New York.   The Mailspect product suite was launched
in 2005 as a Control Panel for Open Source antispam and antivirus scanning engines such as Clamd and Spamassassin.

Mailspect Defense offered easy-to-use configuration and update tools and an integrated Quaratine Solution and Mail Filter.  Subsequently,
the Control Panel has expanded to include commercial scanning engines such as Cloudmark, ESET, F-FROT, Mailshell, and Sophos and built-in
content filers and reputation engines.

Exploitation Technique:
==================
RCE:	Remote, Authenticated
AFR:	Remote, Authenticated
XSS:	Remote, Unauthenticated

Severity Level:
===========
High

Technical Details & Description:
========================
1. Sending a POST request to "/system_module.cgi" with config_version_cmd parameter's value set to a linux command group like "whoami >
/tmp/who; /usr/local/MPP/mppd -v" causes the former command's execution by sending a GET request (or simply visiting) to
"status_info.cgi?group=default" page.
Other parameters with the suffix "_cmd" are probably vulnerable.

2. Sending a GET request to "/monitor_logs_ctl.cgi" with log_dir parameter's value set to "/" and log_file's value set to an arbitrary
file name like "/etc/passwd" will cause the file's content's disclosure.

3. Sending a POST request to "/monitor_manage_logs.cgi" with log_file parameter's value set to an arbitrary file name like "/etc/passwd"
will cause the file's content's disclosure.

4. Sending a POST request to "/monitor_manage_logs.cgi" with login parameter's value set to "></script>js to be executed<script/> leads
the Javascript code's execution.
