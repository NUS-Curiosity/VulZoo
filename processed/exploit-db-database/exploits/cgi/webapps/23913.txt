It has been reported that FTGate is prone to multiple remote input validation vulnerabilities; a cross-site scripting issue and an HTML injection vulnerability. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user supplied input before using it in dynamic web content.

The cross-site scripting issue could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious link to the vulnerable application that includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the security context of the affected web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

An attacker may exploit the HTML injection vulnerability to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user. It may be possible to steal the unsuspecting user's cookie-based authentication credentials, as well as other sensitive information. Other attacks may also be possible.
