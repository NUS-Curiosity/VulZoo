CGIScript.net provides various webmaster related tools and is maintained by Mike Barone and Andy Angrick.

A vulnerability has been reported in the csPassword.cgi script developed by CGIScript.net. It is possible for an authenticated user to add directives and make changes to the generated .htaccess file.

javascript:void(document.form1.title.outerHTML="<textarea name=title>&lt;/textarea&gt;");

Adding the javascript as part of the URL will change the text field into a textbox allowing users to enter newlines and other characters.
