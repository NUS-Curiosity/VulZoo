Portfolio Netpublish Server is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to retrieve arbitrary files in the context of the affected application. Information obtained may aid in further attacks against the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

Netpublish Server 7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
