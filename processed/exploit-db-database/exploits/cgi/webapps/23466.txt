It has been reported that QuikStore Shopping Cart may be prone to an information disclosure vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data through the 'store' parameter of the 'quikstore.cgi' script. An attacker may dislcose the installation path of a file by making a malformed request and passing a single quote "'" character to generate an error message. The error message is reported to contain sensitive information such as the installation path.

Specific vulnerable versions of the software were not identified in the report; therefore it is assumed that the current version QuikStore Shopping Cart v2.12 is vulnerable to this issue.
