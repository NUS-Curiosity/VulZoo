Gattaca Server 2003 is reported prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue presents itself due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data.

A remote attacker can exploit this issue by creating a malicious link to the vulnerable application that includes hostile HTML and script code. If a user follows this link, the hostile code renders in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the security context of the web server and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

Cattaca Server 2003 version 1.1.10.0 is reported prone to this issue. Other versions may also be vulnerable.
