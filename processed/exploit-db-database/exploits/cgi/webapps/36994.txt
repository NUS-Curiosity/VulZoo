WebGlimpse is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Remote attackers can use specially crafted requests with directory-traversal sequences ('../') to retrieve arbitrary files in the context of the application.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

WebGlimpse 2.18.7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
