Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been reported in L-Soft Listserv. An attacker may exploit these issues by embedding hostile HTML and script code in a link to a site hosting the software. This could permit theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks. These issues could also provide an attack vector for latent vulnerabilities in web browser software.
