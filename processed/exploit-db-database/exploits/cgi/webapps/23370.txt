nCUBE Server Manager has been reported prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. The issue presents itself likely due to a lack of sufficient sanitization performed on URI parameters. A remote attacker may exploit this condition by supplying directory traversal sequences as a value for the affected URI parameter passed to a Server Manager script. Ultimately this may allow the attacker to break out of the webserver root and view arbitrary directory listings and potentially arbitrary files on the vulnerable system.
