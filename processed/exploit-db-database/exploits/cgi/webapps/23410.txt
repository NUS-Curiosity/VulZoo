IBM Directory Server is prone to cross-site scripting attacks via the web administrative interface. An attacker may be able to embed hostile HTML and script code in a malicious link to the server, which when followed will be rendered in the victim user's browser. This could allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to launch other attacks.

This issue was reported in Directory Server 4.1. Other versions may also be affected.
