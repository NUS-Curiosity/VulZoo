Tivoli Access Manager Plugin for Web Servers is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the webserver process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks; other attacks are also possible.

Note that the attacker must be an authenticated user to exploit this vulnerability.

Versions 5.1.0.10 and 6.0.0 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
