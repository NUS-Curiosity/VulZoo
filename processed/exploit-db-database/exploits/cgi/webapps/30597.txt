The LevelOne WBR3404TX Broadband Router is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the software fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. These issues occurs in the web management panel.

Exploiting these vulnerabilities may allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks on unsuspecting users in the context of the affected site. As a result, the attacker may be able to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

LevelOne WBR3404TX firmware version R1.94p0vTIG is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
