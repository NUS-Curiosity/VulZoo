Google Desktop is prone to a cross-site scripting weakness because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful attacks must exploit this weakness in conjunction with a latent cross-site scripting vulnerability in the 'google.com' domain.

Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow attackers to access the contents of the Google Desktop search index or potentially to execute arbitrary code.
