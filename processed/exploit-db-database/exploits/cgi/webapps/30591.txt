Alcatel-Lucent OmniPCX Enterprise is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the 'httpd' user. Successful attacks may facilitate a compromise of the application and underlying webserver; other attacks are also possible.

Alcatel-Lucent OmniPCX Enterprise R7.1 and prior versions are vulnerable to this issue.
