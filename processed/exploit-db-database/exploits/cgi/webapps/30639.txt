Cart32 is prone to an arbitrary-file-download vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to download arbitrary files within the context of the webserver process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks.

This issue affects Cart32 6.3; prior versions are also vulnerable.
