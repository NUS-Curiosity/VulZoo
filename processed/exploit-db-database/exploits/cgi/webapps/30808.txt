GWExtranet is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code could execute in the context of the affected website, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

GWExtranet 3.0 is affected by these issues; other versions may also be vulnerable.
