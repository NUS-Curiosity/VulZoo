IT has been reported that Happymall E-Commerce is prone to a file disclosure vulnerability. The problem occurs due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied URI parameters. As a result, it may be possible for an attacker to view the contents of sensitive system files. Files viewed in this manner would be accessed with the privileges of the Happymall process.
