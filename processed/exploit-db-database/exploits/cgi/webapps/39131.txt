Beheer Systeem is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the affected application.

Beheer Systeem 6.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
