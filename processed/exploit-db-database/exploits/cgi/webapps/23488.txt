It has been reported that BulletScript MailList may be prone to an information disclosure vulnerability that may allow remote attackers to gain access to sensitive information. The issue is reported to be present in the 'action' parameter of bsml.pl script. Information gathered via these attacks may aid an attacker in mounting further attacks against a vulnerable system and the affected users.

Due to a lack of information, further details cannot be outlined at the moment. This BID will be updated as more information becomes available.
