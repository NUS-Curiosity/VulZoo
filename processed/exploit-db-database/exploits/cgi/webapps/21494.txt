CGIScript.net provides various webmaster related tools and is maintained by Mike Barone and Andy Angrick.

A vulnerability has been reported in the csPassword.cgi script developed by CGIScript.net that discloses potentially sensitive information to a user. When an error occurs with the csPassword.cgi script, it displays an error message with a lot of debugging information.

http://target/csPassword.cgi?command=remove

This will cause csPassword to execute the remove() function. This function is not defined and thus will cause an error page to be displayed.
