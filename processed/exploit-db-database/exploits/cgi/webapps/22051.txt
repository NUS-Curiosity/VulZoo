Reportedly, ImageFolio is prone to cross site scripting attacks due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. The vulnerability exists in various cgi scripts included with ImageFolio.

As a result, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code which will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user, in the context of the website running Bugzilla.

This issue may be exploited to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users of the website running the vulnerable software.
