Super Site Searcher is prone to remote command execution. Shell metacharacters are not adequately filtered from query string parameters in a request to the vulnerable search engine script. The parameters are then used in a function which passes commands directly through the shell.

A remote attacker may exploit this condition to execute arbitrary commands on the shell with the privileges of the webserver process.

Simple Site Searcher, released by the same vendor, is also prone to this issue.
