SQL-Ledger and LedgerSMB are prone to a remote directory-traversal vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to include arbitrary files located on the vulnerable computer in the context of the webserver process.

The attacker may be able to use the application's built-in text editor to alter a local file and exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code. This may facilitate a compromise of the vulnerable computer.

SQL-Ledger version 2.6.18 and LedgerSMB version 1.0.0 are vulnerable to this issue.
