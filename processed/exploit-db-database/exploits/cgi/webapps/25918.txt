imTRBBS is affected by a remote command execution vulnerability.

Specifically, an attacker can supply arbitrary commands prefixed with the '|' character through the 'im_trbbs.cgi' script that will be executed in the context of the Web server running the application.

This issue is reported to affect imTRBBS version 1.02; other versions may also be vulnerable.
