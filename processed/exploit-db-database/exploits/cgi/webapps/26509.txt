Walla TeleSite is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These are due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.

Walla TeleSite is prone to information and path disclosure, file enumeration, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting attacks within the context of the victim's Web browser and the affected computer.

Other attacks are also possible.

Walla Telesite version 3.0 is affected; earlier versions are also affected.
