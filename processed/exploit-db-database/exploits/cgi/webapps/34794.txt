Intellicom Netbiter webSCADA products are prone to multiple remote security vulnerabilities, including a directory-traversal vulnerability, an information-disclosure vulnerability, and an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit these issues to upload and execute arbitrary script code on an affected computer with the privileges of the webserver process, view arbitrary local files, or obtain sensitive data that can aid in further attacks.

Netbiter webSCADA WS100 and Netbiter webSCADA WS200 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
