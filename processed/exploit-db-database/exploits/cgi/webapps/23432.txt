RemotelyAnywhere has been reported prone to a logout message injection weakness. It has been reported that this issue presents itself due to a lack of sufficient restrictions performed by RemotelyAnywhere on user supplied 'reason' URI parameters. If a target user followed a malicious link, an attacker could potentially abuse this weakness, to include arbitrary messages in logout screens. This may aid in social engineering type attacks against the target user.
