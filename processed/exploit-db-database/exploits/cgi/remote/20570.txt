'dumpenv.pl' is a utility that will display environment information on which the server resides, this information could include the server software version being used, directory settings and path information.

The default authentication credentials for the administrator account in a Sambar Server is Username: admin with the password left blank. Once a remote user has gained knowledge of the path to log into the admin account, it is possible for the user to login to the server via an http request. This unauthorized access is gained providing that the default settings have not been changed.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to complete compromise of the host
