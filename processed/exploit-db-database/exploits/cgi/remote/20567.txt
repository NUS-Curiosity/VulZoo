PHP/FI is an software suite designed to offer enhanced features to sites served via the World Wide Web. It is open source, freely available, and maintained by the PHP development team.

A problem with the software could allow remote users access to restricted resources. Due to a design problem in the software package, the PHP/FI software package allows a remote user to browse directories and view files stored on the local host. It is possible to view only those files which the UID of the local httpd process has access to read. A user with malicious intent could use this vulnerability to gather information on the local host, and possibly gain remote access to encrypted user passwords on a system not using the shadow password suite.
