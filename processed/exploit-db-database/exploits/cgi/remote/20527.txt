Informix Webdriver, the web-to-DB interface used by Informix database products, may permit unauthorized remote access to the system's administration functions.

Under very specific circumstances, if webdriver is called directly, without any additional parameters included in the URL submitted to the server, the response will take the form of a remote administration page which can permit a malicious non-local user to modify or delete database information.

John Wright <john@dryfish.org> notes that this vulnerability will only be exploitable under a particular misconfiguration, and that by default, the above-described URL will result only in a "404 Asset not found", etc, and not in the display of a remote administration page.
