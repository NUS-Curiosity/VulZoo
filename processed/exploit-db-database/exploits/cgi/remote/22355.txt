Thunderstone TEXIS is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability.

Under certain circumstances, an attacker may pass command-line switches as URI parameters to the TEXIS executable. This action may cause the vulnerable server to return sensitive information in the form of a webpage to the attacker's browser.

Information obtained may be used in further attacks against the system.

Versions prior to Texis 4.02.1047934696 20030317 are vulnerable.
