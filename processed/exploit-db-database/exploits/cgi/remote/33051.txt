Nagios is prone to a remote command-injection vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input data.

Remote attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running the application.

NOTE: For an exploit to succeed, access to the WAP interface's ping feature must be allowed.

Versions prior to Nagios 3.1.1 are vulnerable.
