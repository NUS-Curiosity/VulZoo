Web+ is an e-commerce server designed to run under a webserver, to provide web storefronts. The various scripts that are required to do this are specified to the webpsvr daemon via a 'script' variable passed to the webplus CGI. This CGI can be passed a path to any file via the script variable, resulting in arbitrary files being displayed to the browser. This vulnerability is limited to files that are known to the user and that the webpsvr daemon has read access to.
