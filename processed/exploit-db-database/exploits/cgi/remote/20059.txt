Poll It is a Perl CGI application used to create and maintain opinion polls on websites. The program relies on a number of internal variables. These variables can be overwritten by any remote user by specifying the new value as a variable in the GET request. This is due to the fact that Poll It overwrites variables to user-supplied values after it sets them to the internally-specified defaults.

This can lead to unauthorized file reads, as well as potentially other compromises.
