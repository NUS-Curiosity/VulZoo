Regardless of privilege level, any remote user can modify the administrative password for CGI Script Centers' Account Manager. In order to accomplish this, a user would access the following URL with a POST command:

http://target/cgibin/amadmin.pl?setpasswd

This would grant the user full administrative privileges which includes the capability of granting and revoking user access to secured areas of the target website.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w

## This exploit let's you change the administrator
