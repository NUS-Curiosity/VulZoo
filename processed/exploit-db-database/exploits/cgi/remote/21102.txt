Power Up HTML is a set of HTML-like commands that can be placed into web pages. It provides a central routing point to simplify programming and customization of CGI scripts.

A vulnerability exists in Power Up HTML which allows directory traversal through the web server using ../ strings in a CGI request. This directory traversal can be used to view or execute arbitrary files on the webserver to which the web service has permissions. Failure to filter metacharacters from HTTP requests can allow user-supplied values to run.
