Miva's htmlscript CGI program provides a unique scripting language with HTML type tags. (Note that htmlscript is an older product no longer distributed by Miva under that name.) Versions of the htmlscript interpreter (a CGI script) prior to 2.9932 are vulnerable to a file reading directory traversal attack using relative paths (eg., "../../../../../../etc/passwd"). An attacker need only append this path as a variable passed to the script via a URL. The contents of any file to which the web server process has read access can be retrieved using this method.
