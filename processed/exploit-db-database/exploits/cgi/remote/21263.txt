FAQ-O-Matic is a freely available, open-source FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) manager. It is intended to run on Linux and Unix variants.

FAQ-O-Matic does not sufficiently filter script code from URL parameters. It is possible to create a malicious link containing arbitrary script code. When a legitimate user browses the malicious link, the script code will be executed in the user's browser in the context of the website running Faq-O-Matic.

As a result, it may be possible for a remote attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from a legitimate user of the service.
