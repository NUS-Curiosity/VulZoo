The 'cached_feed' CGI script supplied by newsfeed vendor Moreover.com contains a file-disclosure vulnerability. The script's 'obtain_file' function, designed to return the contents of a specified file for display in the browser, fails to adequately filter ".." character sequences in user-supplied input. As a result, a carefully formed URL that is submitted to the script can result in the disclosure of files (readable by HTTP user) outside of the CGI script's "allowed" area.

Version 1.0 of the product is affected. The vendor repaired the script and released version 2.0 before this vulnerability was published.
