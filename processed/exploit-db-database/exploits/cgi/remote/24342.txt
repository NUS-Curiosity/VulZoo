Reportedly Webcam Corp Webcam Watchdog is affected by a remote cross-site scripting vulnerability in the sresult.exe binary. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to including it in dynamically generated web content.

As a result of this vulnerability, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user. Specifically the attacker can pass malicious HTML code as a value for the affected URI parameter supplied to 'sresult.exe'. All code will be executed within the context of the website running the vulnerable software.
