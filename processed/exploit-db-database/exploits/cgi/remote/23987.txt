SurgeLDAP is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability in one of the scripts included with the built-in web administrative server, potentially resulting in disclosure of files.

A remote attacker could exploit this issue to gain access to system files outside of the web root directory of the built-in web server. Files that are readable by the web server could be disclosed via this issue.
