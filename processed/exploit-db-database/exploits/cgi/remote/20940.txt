Tarantella Enterprise 3 is a tool for centralized management of data and applications. It is operated via a web interface. It will run on a number of Unix and Linux distributions.

ttawebtop.cgi is a CGI script included with the Tarantella, formerly SCO. ttawebtop.cgi is designed as management tool, designed to allow a user clicking a link to display and resume an application at any time.

ttawebtop.cgi does not sufficiently validate input. In not doing so, it's possible for a remote user to traverse the directory structure, and view any file that is readable by the webserver process.
