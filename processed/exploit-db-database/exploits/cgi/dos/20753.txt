Net.Commerce is part of the Websphere platform of products distributed by IBM. Net.Commerce provides several versatile features to facilitate e-commerce, and features in performance and reliability.

A problem in the Net.Commerce package could allow a remote user to deny service to legitimate users of the service hosted by the Websphere server. This is due to the handling of long strings by the macro.d2w cgi included with a Net.Commerce installation. By supplying a long string of "%0a" characters to the CGI, the Websphere server ceases operation.

A remote user may use this vulnerability to crash the Websphere server, thus denying service to legitimate users.
