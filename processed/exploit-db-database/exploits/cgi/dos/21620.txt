A vulnerability has been reported for Oddsock Song Requester 2.1.

The vulnerability occurs when an attacker makes a request to 'request.cgi' using a long value for the 'listpos' parameter. It is possible to cause Song Requester and WinAmp to crash. As this condition may be due to a buffer overflow, code execution should be considered a possibility.

Note: it was reported that the value for the 'psearch' parameter also causes a crash, however this could not be reproduced by SecurityFocus.
