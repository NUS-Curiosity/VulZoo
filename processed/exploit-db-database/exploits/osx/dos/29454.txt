Apple Mac OS X is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability when handling a DMG image containing a specially crafted HFS+ filesystem.

A successful exploit can allow an attacker to cause a kernel panic, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

Mac OS X 10.4.8 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
