Apple Mac OS X is prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability that is caused by a race condition.

Exploiting this issue allows local, unprivileged users to crash affected kernels, denying further service to legitimate users.

/*
  Mac OS X 10.5.6/10.5.7 ptrace() mutex handling DoS
  ==================================================
  This code should be run in a loop and due to problems
  with mutex handling in ptrace a DoS can occur when a
  destroyed mutex is attempted to be interlocked by OSX
  kernel giving rise to a race condition. You may need
  to run this code multiple times.

  - Tested against 10.5.6
  - Tested against 10.5.7

  while `true`;do ./prdelka-vs-APPLE-ptracepanic;done

  This code is dedicated to a friend who I met in this
  place. Long live the exploit scene. R.I.P str0ke.
