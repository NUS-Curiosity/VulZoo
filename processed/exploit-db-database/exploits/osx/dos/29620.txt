Apple Mac OS X ImageIO is prone to an integer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to handle specially crafted image files.

A remote attacker can exploit this issue to cause denial-of-service conditions and potentially to execute code, but this has not been confirmed.

This issue affects Mac OS X 10.4.8; previous versions may also be affected.




Release Date:
February 19th, 2007

Severity:
High

Vendor:
Apple

Versions Affected:
OSX 10.4.8

Overview:
An integer overflow vulnerability exists within ImageIO when processing a malformed .gif file. This allows for an attacker to cause the application to crash, and or to execute arbitrary code on the targeted host.

Technical Details:
When decompressing a specially crafted .gif file, the gifGetBandProc function within ImageIO incorrectly parses the malformed data causing the application to segmentation fault.

Below the crash is triggered on OS X 10.4.8 using Safari:

Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
Reason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0x3991b000
0x918f2dc5 in gifGetBandProc ()
