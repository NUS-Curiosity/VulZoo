Apple Mac OS X is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability when handling specially crafted UDTO disk image files.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote users to crash affected computers, denying service to legitimate users. Attackers may also be able to exploit this issue for remote code execution, but this is reportedly unlikely.

Mac OS X 10.4.8 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
