Multiple products for Mac OS X are prone to multiple remote format-string vulnerabilities. The affected applications include Help Viewer, Safari, iPhoto, and iMovie.

Exploiting these issues can allow attacker-supplied data to be written to arbitrary memory locations, which can facilitate the execution of arbitrary machine code with the privileges of a targeted application. Failed exploit attempts will likely crash the application.

Help Viewer 3.0.0, Safari 2.0.4, iMovie HD 6.0.3, and iPhoto 6.0.5 are reported affected; other versions may be vulnerable as well.
