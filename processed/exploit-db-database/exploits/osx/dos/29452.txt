Apple Mac OS X is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability. This issue occurs when the UFS filesystem handler fails to handle specially crafted DMG images.

A successful exploit can allow a remote attacker to cause kernel panic, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

Mac OS X 10.4.8 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
