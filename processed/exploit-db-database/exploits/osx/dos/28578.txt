Apple Mac OS X kextload is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it to a finite-sized memory buffer.

This issue is not exploitable by itself, because kextload is not installed as a setuid-superuser application by default. To exploit this issue, an attacker must use another program running with elevated privileges to directly manipulate the arguments passed to kextload.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary machine code with superuser privileges. A successful exploit may result in the complete compromise of the affect computer.

Example kextload buffer-overflow vulnerability affecting TDIXsupport:

netragard-test:$ sudo ktrace -di ./TDIXSupport `perl -e 'print "A" x 1000'`/TDIXController.kext
