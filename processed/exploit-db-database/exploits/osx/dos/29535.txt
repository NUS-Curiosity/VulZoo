Flip4Mac is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability.

Flip4Mac is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability because the application fails to properly handle malformed WMV files.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application or to trigger a denial-of-service condition.

Flip4Mac Windows Media Components for QuickTime version 2.1.0.33 is reported vulnerable; other versions may be affected as well.
