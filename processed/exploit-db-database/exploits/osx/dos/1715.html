Release Date:
April 23th, 2006

Vendor:
Apple Computer Inc.

Tested on:
iBook G4 1.2 GHz with Mac OS X 10.4.5 (Build 8H14) + all Updates from Apple except "10.4.6 Update"

Versions affected:

Safari 2.0.3 (417.9.2) latest version under 10.4.6 (Build 8I127) and perhaps prior versions

Overview:
A vulnerabilitiy exists in Safari 2.0.3 (417.9.2) and perhaps in
prior versions which causes the operating system to slow down SRCOD
(Spinning Rainbow Cursor Of Death), and therefore, it's not possible
to launch any applications like Terminal to kill the process. After
several minutes Safari crashes.
