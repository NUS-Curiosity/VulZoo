Apple Mac OS X is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability when handling specially crafted UDIF disk image files.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote users to crash affected computers, denying service to legitimate users.

Mac OS X version 10.4.8 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.

Note: Further information from Alastair Houghton reports that this issue cannot be exploited to execute arbitrary code. See the references for details.
