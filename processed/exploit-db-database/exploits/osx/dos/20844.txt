Apple Personal Web Sharing is a utility that allows users to extend file-sharing abilities across a small intranet. It is shipped with MacOS 9.

A user may craft a URL which contains excess characters to cause the file-sharing system to shut down.

The file sharing system must then be restarted to regain its functionality once again.
