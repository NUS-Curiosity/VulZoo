It turns out that the spoofed no-more-senders notification bug when applied to iokit objects
was actually just a more complicated way to hit ::clientClose in parallel. We can in fact
do this very simply by calling IOServiceClose on two threads :)

Like the spoofed notifications this leads to many bugs in many userclients, the exact nature
of which depends on the semantics of the clientClose implementation.

In this particular case we hit a kernel UaF.

Tested on El Capitan 10.10.1 15b42 on MacBookAir 5,2

repro: while true; do ./ioparallel_close; done
