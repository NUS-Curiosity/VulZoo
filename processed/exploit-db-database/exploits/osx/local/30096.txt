Apple Mac OS X's VPN service daemon is prone to a format-string vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before passing it as the format specifier to a formatted-printing function.

Attackers may exploit this issue to crash the application or execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges. Successful exploits can result in a complete compromise of vulnerable computers.

Apple Mac OS X Server 10.4.9 and prior versions are vulnerable to this issue.

This issue was originally included in BID 24144 (Apple Mac OS X 2007-005 Multiple Security Vulnerabilities), but has been given its own record.
