Apple Mac OS X 'kextload' is prone to a format-string vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

This issue is not exploitable by itself, because kextload is not installed as a setuid-superuser application by default. To exploit this issue, an attacker must use another application running with elevated privileges in order to directly manipulate the arguments passed to kextload.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary machine code with superuser privileges. A successful exploit may result in the complete compromise of the affect computer.

Example of kextload format-string vulnerability affecting TDIXSupport:

netragard-test:$ ./TDIXSupport %x%x%x%x%x%x%/TDIXController.kext
kextload: /Library/Application Support/Roxio/90b4b6ca1c6973747365206578682062756e646c65/TDIXController.kext: no such bundle file exists can't add kernel extension %x%x%x%x%x%x%/TDIXController.kext (file access/permissions) (run kextload on this kext with -t for diagnostic output)
