At Ease 5.0 will allow a user to access any user's volume on the server through a web browser.

The tested configuration is as follows:

MacOS 7.6.1 (should work with anything greater than 7)
At Ease 5.0.2
AppleShare IP 5.0.3
Netscape 4.0.7 (No reason it shouldn't work from .99 to 4.5)

Log in as any user that has access to Netscape Communicator, and type in
f i l e://Macintosh%20HD/System%20Folder/
and you are able to access the disk.

Do the same thing, except use
f i l e://At%20Ease%20Volume%20Name/At%20Ease%20%Docs/username
and it's quite easy to browse through anyones files.

It is possible to download files from that users directory. I have been unable to actually open any of the files once they are downloaded, however in an educational setting, just viewing names in a certian directory could constitute some serious problems (such as if a teacher works with Special Education studends, and has a list of documents to their parents).
