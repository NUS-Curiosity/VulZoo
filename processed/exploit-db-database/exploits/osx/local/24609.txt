RsyncX is reported to contain an insecure temporary file creation vulnerability. The result of this is that temporary files created by the application may use predictable filenames.

A local attacker may exploit this vulnerability to execute symbolic link file overwrite attacks.

When using the scheduler component of RsyncX, /tmp/cron_rsyncxtmp
is insecurely used. A user can create a dir /tmp/blahdir,
then
ln -s /tmp/blahdir/file /tmp/cron.rsyncxtmp

After RsyncX scheduler is used by an admin, /etc/crontab
will become a symlink pointing to /tmp/blahdir/file.
