Apple Mac OS X is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability. Since the software fails to sufficiently sanitize input, a remote attacker could use the Bluetooth file- and object-exchange services to access files outside the default file-exchange directory.

This issue was initially reported in BID 13480 (Apple Mac OS X Multiple Vulnerabilities). Due to the availability of more information, this issue is being assigned a new BID.
