The Apple Mac OS X AirPort wireless driver is prone to multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because it fails to perform sufficient bounds checking before copying data to finite-sized buffers.

An attacker can exploit these issues to have arbitrary machine code execute with kernel-level privileges. One of the issues allows code execution in the context of an application using the wireless API. This may lead to denial-of-service conditions or the complete compromise of the affected computer.
