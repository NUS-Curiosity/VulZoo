The PoC triggers a pool buffer overflow in win32k!vSolidFillRect. When using Special Pool we get the crash immediately on the overwrite. Without Special Pool we often get a crash in the same function, but sometimes it crashes in a different function (similar to another issue, however with a different offset). This might be a result of the memory corruption or an out-of-memory condition before the overflow is triggered. Debugger output for all three different crashes attached.
