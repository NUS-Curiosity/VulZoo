The attached PoC demonstrate a use-after-free condition that occurs when operating on a DeferWindowPos object from multiple threads. The DeferWindowPos() call will trigger and block on the execution of a window procedure in a separate thread from which we call EndDeferWindowPos on the same handle. specialpool.txt contains the debugger output with Session Pool enabled, crash.txt the debugger output without Session Pool.
