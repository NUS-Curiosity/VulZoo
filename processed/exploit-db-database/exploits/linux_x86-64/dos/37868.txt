The attached sample, signal_sigsegv_7ffff603deef_1525_268381c02bc3b05c84578ebaeafc02f0.swf, typically crashes in this way on my Linux x64 build (Flash v17.0.0.188):

=> 0x00007f693155bf58:	mov    (%rdi),%rbx
rdi            0x23c	572

At first glance this might appear to be a NULL dereference but sometimes it crashes trying to access 0xc8 and different builds have shown crashes at much wilder addresses, so there is probably a use-after-free or other non-deterministic condition going on. For example, our fuzzing cluster saw a crash at 0x400000001.

The base sample from which the fuzz case is derived is also attached.
