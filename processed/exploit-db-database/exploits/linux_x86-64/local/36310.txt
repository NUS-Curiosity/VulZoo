This is a proof-of-concept exploit that is able to gain kernel
privileges on machines that are susceptible to the DRAM "rowhammer"
problem.  It runs as an unprivileged userland process on x86-64 Linux.
It works by inducing bit flips in page table entries (PTEs).

For development purposes, the exploit program has a test mode in which
it induces a bit flip by writing to /dev/mem.  qemu_runner.py will run
the exploit program in test mode in a QEMU VM.  It assumes that
"bzImage" (in the current directory) is a Linux kernel image that was
built with /dev/mem enabled (specifically, with the the
CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM option disabled).
