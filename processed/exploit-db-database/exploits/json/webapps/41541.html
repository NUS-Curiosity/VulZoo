<!--
Remote code execution via CSRF vulnerability in the web UI of Deluge 1.3.13

Kyle Neideck, February 2017


Product
-------

Deluge is a BitTorrent client available from http://deluge-torrent.org.

Fix
---

Fixed in the (public) source code, but not in binary releases yet. See
http://git.deluge-torrent.org/deluge/commit/?h=develop&id=11e8957deaf0c76fdfbac62d99c8b6c61cfdddf9
and
http://git.deluge-torrent.org/deluge/commit/?h=1.3-stable&id=318ab179865e0707d7945edc3a13a464a108d583

Install from source or use the web UI from an incognito/private window until
new binaries are released.

Summary
-------

Deluge version 1.3.13 is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery in the Web UI
plug-in resulting in remote code execution. Requests made to the /json endpoint
are not checked for CSRF. See the "render" function of the "JSON" class in
deluge/ui/web/json_api.py.

The Web UI plug-in is installed, but not enabled, by default. If the user has
enabled the Web UI plug-in and logged into it, a malicious web page can use
forged requests to make Deluge download and install a Deluge plug-in provided
by the attacker. The plug-in can then execute arbitrary code as the user
running Deluge (usually the local user account).

To Reproduce
------------

 - Create/find a Deluge plug-in to be installed on the victim machine. For
   example, create an empty plug-in with
       python deluge/scripts/create_plugin.py --name malicious --basepath . \
           --author-name "n" --author-email "e"
   (see
   http://git.deluge-torrent.org/deluge/tree/deluge/scripts/create_plugin.py?h=1.3-stable&id=318ab179865e0707d7945edc3a13a464a108d583)
   and add a line to its __init__.py to launch calc.exe.
 - Build the plug-in as a .egg (if necessary):
       python malicious/setup.py bdist_egg
 - Make a torrent containing the .egg and seed it somewhere.
 - Create a Magnet link for the torrent.
 - In the proof-of-concept page below, update the PLUGIN_NAME, PLUGIN_FILE and
   MAGNET_LINK constants.
 - Put the PoC on a web server somewhere. Serving it locally is fine.
 - In Deluge, open Preferences, go to the Plugins category and enable the Web
   UI plug-in.
 - Go to the WebUi preferences section and check "Enable web interface". The
   port should be set to 8112 by default.
 - If you're serving the PoC over HTTPS, check "Enable SSL" so its requests
   don't get blocked as mixed content. If you're not, SSL can be enabled or
   disabled.
 - Go to localhost:8112 in a browser on the victim machine and log in.
 - Open the PoC in the same browser.

The PoC sends requests to localhost:8112 that include cookies. The first
request adds the torrent, which downloads the .egg (the plug-in) to /tmp. It
then sends repeated requests to install the .egg and enable it. The attacker's
code in the plug-in runs when the plug-in is enabled.

For the attack to be successful, the PoC page must be left open until the
malicious plug-in finishes downloading. An attacker could avoid that limitation
by using the Execute plug-in, which is installed by default, but Deluge has to
be restarted before the Execute plug-in can be used. I don't think that can be
done from the web UI, so the attacker's code would only execute after the
victim restarted Deluge and then added/removed/completed a torrent.

The PoC adds the plug-in torrent using a Magnet link because it would need to
read the web UI's responses to add a .torrent file, which CORS prevents.
