Vulnerability Details
Vulnerability Name : Persistent Cross Site Scripting
Affected Parameter(s) : fname & lname

Steps to reproduce
Step 1 : Login to the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.

Step 2 : Navigate to Performance Tuning module, Username will be displayed as below :-
				Last Edited By <USERNAME>
	Note :- Modify the configuration for example and check the Last Edited By - Username. Any user (Admin or Non admin) who have privileges to change the configuration can act like an attacker.

Step 3 : Navigate to My Account and update first name and last name.

Step 4: Intercept the request using burp suite and insert the <Video><source onerror=”alert(1)”> payload & <Video><source onerror=”alert(2)”> payload in fname and lname parameter.

Step 5 : It has been observed that My account module is not vulnerable to XSS but Performance Tuning tab under Operations -> Performance is vulnerable, as the Performance Tuning tab displays the user’s first name and last name separately as “Last Edited By USERNAME”.

Step 6 : Now navigate to Performance Tuning module. It is seen that the application is vulnerable to Persistent Cross Site Scripting.

Note : It has been observed that any user who has access to Performance Tuning tab will be vulnerable and the same javascript payload will execute for them as well.
