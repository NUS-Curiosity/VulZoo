[CVE Reference]
CVE-2020-7030
ASA-2020-077


[Security Issue]
A sensitive information disclosure vulnerability exists in the web interface component of IP Office that
may potentially allow a local user to gain unauthorized access to the component.

The request URL on port 7071 and the web socket component requests on port 7070 used by Atmosphere-Framework
within Avaya IP Office, pass Base64 encoded credentials as part of the URL query string.

Base64 credentials: QWRtaW5pc3RyYXRvcjpBZG1pbmlzdHJhdG9y
