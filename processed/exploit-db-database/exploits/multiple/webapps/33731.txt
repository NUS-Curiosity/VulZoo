Friendly Technologies TR-069 ACS is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application, gain administrator access, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Friendly Technologies TR-069 ACS 2.8.9 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example data is available:

Username: ' or 1=1--
Password: ' or 1=1--
