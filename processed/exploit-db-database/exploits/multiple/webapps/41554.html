Business recommendation:
------------------------
During a quick security check, SEC Consult identified four vulnerabilities,
which are partially critical. As the time frame of the test was limited, it is
suspected that there are more vulnerabilities in the application.

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult to apply the patch resolving the
identified vulnerabilities before using Navetti PricePoint in an environment
with potential attackers.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) SQL Injection (Blind boolean based)
Navetti PricePoint is prone to SQL injection attacks. The attacks can be
executed by all privilege levels, ranging from the lowest privileged users to
the highest privileged users.

By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker gains access to all records
stored in the database with the privileges of the database user.

2) Multiple persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities
The web application suffers from multiple persistent cross site scripting issues.
Low privileged users as well as high privileged users, are able to inject
malicious JavaScript payloads persistently in the application. This
vulnerability is even more critical, because it can be used by a low privileged
user who wants to elevate his privileges. The low privileged attacker can
place a payload which creates a new superuser, or add his own account to the
superuser group. If a superuser logs in to the application, the JavaScript
payload is executed with the rights of the superuser and the new user is
created or added to the superuser group.

3) Multiple reflected cross site scripting vulnerabilities
Navetti PricePoint suffers from multiple reflected cross site scripting issues.
The code which is used to generate error messages inside of the application,
does not correctly escape/sanitize user input. Due to that all error messages
containing user input are prone to reflected cross site scripting attacks.
Furthermore the file upload dialog does not correctly sanitize the file name of
uploaded files. If a file name contains a JavaScript payload, it is executed in
the file upload dialog.

4) Cross Site Request Forgery
Navetti PricePoint doesn't implement any kind of cross site request forgery
protection. Attackers are able to execute arbitrary requests with the privileges
of any user. The only requirement is, that the victim clicks on a malicious
link. For example an administrator can be forced to execute unwanted actions.
Some of these actions are:

  -) Add users
  -) Delete users
  -) Add users to an arbitrary role
  -) Change internal settings of the application


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) SQL Injection (Blind boolean based)
The search function in the tree structure, which displays various groups, does
not properly validate user input, allowing an attacker with any privilege level
to  inject arbitrary SQL commands and read the contents of the whole database.

The following URL could be used to perform blind SQL injection attacks:
-) URL: /NBN.Host/PMWorkspace/PMWorkspace/FamilieTreeSearch
  (Parameter: searchString, Type: GET)

2) Multiple persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities
The following URL parameters have been identified to be vulnerable against
persistent cross site scripting:

-) URL: /NBN.Host/Component/Competitors/AddEdit (Parameter: name,POST)
-) URL: /NBN.Host/Component/ItemSearchGrid/EditData (Parameter: Quality105,POST)
-) URL: /NBN.Host/component/GroupInfo/SaveGroup (Parameter: name,POST)

The proof of concept shows just selected examples of cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities. Based on the conducted tests, SEC Consult identified that
proper input validation is lacking.
Due to the limited time frame of the test, it was not possible to verify every
single parameter of the application. Therefore, it can be assumed, that there
are similar flaws in other parts of the web application.

3) Multiple reflected cross site scripting vulnerabilities
The application is also prone to reflected cross site scripting attacks. The
vulnerabilities were observed in at least two main parts of the application.
Those two parts are error messages and the file upload functionality.

-) Error Messages
    Every user input which is reflected in error messages, is not correctly
    escaped and injection of malicious JavaScript code is possible.

-) File uploads
    The file upload functionality is not correctly escaping the filename of
    uploaded files. If a victim is forced to upload a special crafted file, an
    arbitrary JavaScript payload can be triggered and executed in the victim's
    context. An example for a working, but very obvious payload in the filename
    would be the following example:

    -) <img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookies)>.xlsx

4) Cross Site Request Forgery
The application is prone to cross site request forgery attacks because no
measures such as CSRF tokens or nounces, are in place. The following proof of
concept deletes the user account
with ID 18:
-->

<html>
<body>
 <script>
    function submitRequest()
    {
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open("POST", "https://($IP|$Domain)/NBN.Host/PermissionsManagement/
        PermissionsManagement/DeleteUsers", true);
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept", "*/*");
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Accept-Language", "en-US,en;q=0.5");
        xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", "text/plain");
        xhr.withCredentials = true;
        var body = "{\"DeleteAll\":false,\"UserIDs\":[\"18\"]}";
        var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length);
        for (var i = 0; i < aBody.length; i++)
                aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i);
        xhr.send(new Blob([aBody]));
    }
</script>
<form action="#">
 <input type="button" value="Submit request" onclick="submitRequest();" />
</form>
</body>
</html>

<!--
If a victim visits a website, which is hosted by an attacker, the script above
would be executed and the user with the userID 18 would be deleted. Due to the
complete absence of measures against cross site request forgery, it can be
assumed that the application is vulnerable for this
kind of attack.
