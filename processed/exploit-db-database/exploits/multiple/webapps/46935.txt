Phraseanet is an Open Source Digital Asset Management software distributed under GNU GPLV3 license.
Registered user (or even guest user, depends of configuration) can upload pictures, videos, pdfs or any other document.
A crafted file name for uploaded document leads to stored XSS. In simplest form the name of the file would be:
"><svg onload=alert(1)>.jpg
or:
"><svg onload=alert(document.cookie)>.jpg
Please notice that the file name should start from double quotation mark.
Once a picture will be uploaded it will pop up an alert window and keep popping up every time anybody will login to the website.
Another example of more malicious usage would be this file name:
"><svg onload=window.history.back()>.jpg
From now on every attempt to login will end up with redirection one step back - to login page.
Please be aware that this will not affect Chrome browser and other browsers built on chrome engine which has XSS filter built in.
