# Date: 16-02-2018
# Exploit Author: Marios Nicolaides - RUNESEC
# Reviewers: Simon Loizides and Nicolas Markitanis - RUNESEC
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.oracle.com
# Affected Software: Oracle Primavera P6 Enterprise Project Portfolio Management 8.3, 8.4, 15.1, 15.2, 16.1
# Tested on: Oracle Primavera P6 Enterprise Project Portfolio Management (Build: 15.1.0.0 (B0163) 14.03.2015.1305) / Oracle WebLogic 12.1.3.0.0
# CVE: CVE-2017-10046
# Category: Web Application

Overview
--------

The Oracle Primavera Project Portfolio Management application is vulnerable to HTTP
Response Splitting.

The application takes the user's input from the languageCode parameter and includes
it in the ORA-PWEB_LANGUAGE_1111 cookie value within the "Set-Cookie" HTTP Response
header. The application allows an attacker to inject LF (line feed) characters and
break out of the headers into the message body and write arbitrary content into the
application's response.

As a result, this could enable an attacker to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks
(XSS), redirect victims to malicious websites, and poison web and browser caches.


Details
-------

The exploit can be demonstrated as follows:
    1. A malicious attacker crafts the following URL:
        /p6/LoginHandler?languageCode=runesec%0a%0a%0a<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>%0a
    2. The attacker sends the above URL to an Oracle Primavera Project Portfolio Management application user.
    3. The "malicious" JavaScript payload will execute in the victim's browser and display a popup box showing the victim's cookies.

Please note that the payload used above is for demonstration purposes only. A real attacker would try to steal the user's cookies
or perform other malicious actions.

The above exploit was tested against the following components:
    Application: Oracle Primavera (Build: 15.1.0.0 (B0163) 14.03.2015.1305)
    Underlying Infrastructure: Oracle WebLogic 12.1.3.0.0


Impact
------

An attacker might be able to steal the user's session cookie and/or credentials.
As a result, the attacker would be able to gain unauthorized access to the application.
Further, an attacker might be able to poison web and/or browser caches in an attempt
to perform a persistent attack.
