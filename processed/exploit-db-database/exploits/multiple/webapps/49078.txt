About TestBox
------------------------
TestBox is an open source testing framework for ColdFusion (CFML). It is written and maintained by Ortus Solutions, and can be
downloaded/installed as a stand-alone package as well as being distributed as part of Ortus' ColdBox CFML MVC framework (https://www.coldbox.org/).

TestBox is normally deployed in directories "/testbox" (or "/test") under the root of the corresponding ColdFusion/ColdBox application,
and allows users to run CFML unit tests and to generate reports.

As per the vendor, TestBox is meant for development & testing purposes only and should not be deployed to production environments.

Directory Traversal
------------------------
The TestBox "test-browser" page does not adequately sanitise the "path" QueryString parameter, allowing an attacker
to perform a directory traversal on the page by specifying the value "path=/../" (appending '../' all the way up to the
system root).

Sample URL:
http://<HOST>/testbox/test-browser/index.cfm?path=/../
