IBM BladeCenter Advanced Management Module is prone to the following remote vulnerabilities:

- An HTML-injection vulnerability
- A cross-site scripting vulnerability
- An information-disclosure vulnerability
- Multiple cross-site request-forgery vulnerabilities

An attacker can exploit these issues to obtain sensitive information, execute arbitrary script code, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and perform actions as an authenticated user of the application. Other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to BladeCenter Advanced Management Module 1.42U are vulnerable.
