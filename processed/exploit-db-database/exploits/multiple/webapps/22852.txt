Introduction:
=============
Tapeless Enterprise-Level Data Backup and Protection, Without the Price Tag. Automatic, real-time data backup for
servers, laptops and PCs. Features include file versioning, fast data recovery, and automatic offsite backup
capabilities to protect businesses against disasters. SonicWALL� Continuous Data Protection (CDP) v6 is a next-
generation data backup and disaster recovery solution that automatically preserves and protects business-relevant
data assets against loss from file, device, and location based disasters. With support for Windows�, Linux� and
Mac OS� through a single Web GUI, CDP provides granular, globally enforced policy controls over the entire backup
operation. Unmatched flexibility enables IT administrators to dictate what information to backup, what to exclude
and how the information should be maintained to adhere to recovery and compliance requirements. A sophisticated
new fileset backup methodology combined with agent-based data de-duplication moves and stores only unique data
blocks. This speeds the backup process and optimizes bandwidth usage while maintaining total information continuity
and the ability to flexibly restore multiple revisions. SonicWALL Continuous Data Protection v6 offers the
comprehensive data protection organizations demand and the power administrators need for vigilant data backup
and disaster recovery.

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent input validation vulnerabilities are detected in SonicWalls Continuous Data Protection v6.x  5040 appliance application.
The vulnerability allows an remote attacker or local low privileged user account to inject/implement malicious persistent script code
on application side of the appliance application.

The vulnerabilities are located in the network, accounts management and system settings modules with the bound vulnerable label
delAppl (name, username & servername) parameters. An attackers can inject script code as name, username or servername via add function
to manipulate the vulnerable module with malicious persistent web context. The persistent script code will be executed when the victim
is processing to watch the vulnerable module listing (output|index).

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in session hijacking (customer/manager/admin) or stable (persistent) module
context manipulation. Exploitation requires low user inter action and a low privileged web application user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Network > Settings [Name]
				[+] BMR > Accounts  [Username]
				[+] System > Settings [Server]

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] label delAppl - Name
				[+] label delAppl - Username
				[+] label delAppl - Servername


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with local low privileged user accounts and
low required user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+).
