# 1. Description
# Dicoogle is an open source medical imaging repository with an extensible
# indexing system and distributed mechanisms. In version 2.5.0, it is vulnerable
# to local file inclusion. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files that the
# web user has access to. Admin credentials aren't required. The ‘UID’ parameter
# via GET is vulnerable.

# 2. Proof of Concept
