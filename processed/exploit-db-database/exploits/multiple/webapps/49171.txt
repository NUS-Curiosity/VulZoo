#Vendor Homepage: https://churchcrm.io/
#Software Link: https://github.com/ChurchCRM/CRM
#Version: 4.2.0
#Payload:  =10+20+cmd|' /C calc'!A0

#Proof Of Concept:
CSV Injection (aka Excel Macro Injection or Formula Injection) exists in
List Event Types feature in ChurchCRM v4.2.0 via Name field that is
mistreated while exporting to a CSV file.
To exploit this vulnerability:

   1. Login to the application, goto 'Events' module and then "List Event
   Types"
   2. Edit any event and inject the payload =10+20+cmd|' /C calc'!A0 in the
   'Name' field
   3. Now goto 'List Event types' module and click CSV to download the CSV
   file
   4. Open the CSV file, allow all popups and our payload is executed
   (calculator is opened).
