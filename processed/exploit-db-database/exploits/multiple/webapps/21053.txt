 I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

Splunk <= 4.3.3 Reading Arbitrary Files Contents

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

Splunk[1][2][3] is a software to search, monitor and analyze
machine-generated data by applications, systems and IT infrastructure
at scale via a web-style interface.[4] Splunk captures, indexes and
correlates real-time data in a searchable repository from which it can
generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations.[5][6]

Splunk aims to make machine data accessible across an organization and
identifies data patterns[7], provides metrics, diagnoses problems and
provides intelligence for business operation. Splunk is a horizontal
technology used for application management, security and compliance,
as well as business and web analytics.[8] Splunk has over 3,700
licensed customers in 74 countries, including almost half of the
Fortune 100.[9]

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

Splunk 4.3.3 and prior versions has "Data Preview" functionality located at:

"Manager >> Data Inputs >> Files & Directories >> Data Preview"
which allows an authenticated user to read the content of arbitrary
files on the server it is running.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

1 - Go to the screen of functionality located at "Manager >> Data
Inputs >> Files & Directories >> Data Preview".
2 - Insert the path to file into "Path to file on server" field.
3 - Click on Continue.
4 - See the content of file.

The following screenshots illustrate reading the contents of /etc/shadow:

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

An authenticated attacker with admin privileges on splunk could
exploit the vulnerability to retrieve the contents of any sensitive
files in the server accessible by the operating system user the splunk
service is running as. If splunkd is running as root user, the
attacker can read the content of any file in the server, including
/etc/shadow and other sensitive configuration files. Thus, being an
admin in the splunk UI allows an attacker to obtain information that
may lead to escalation of privileges on the operating system where
splunk is installed.

The vendor was notified of this behavior, and declared not to consider
it either a defect or a vulnerability.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

Version 4.3.3 and prior versions are vulnerable.

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

N/A.
