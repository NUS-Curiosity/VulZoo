Technical Details & Description:
================================
A html inject web vulnerability has been discovered in the official ImportExportTools NG 10.0.4 for mozilla thunderbird.
The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject html payloads to compromise application data or session credentials.

The vulnerability is located in the html export function. Subject content on export is not sanitized like on exports in mozilla itself.
Thus allows a remote attacker to send malicious emails with malformed a html payloads that executes on preview after a html export by
the victim user.

Vulnerable Module(s):

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1. Install mozilla thunderbird
2. Install ImportExportTools NG v10.0.4
3. Use another email to write to the target inbox were the export takes place
Note: Inject into the subject any html test payload
4. Target user exports his content of the inbox in html were the payload executes
5. Successful reproduce of the encode validation vulnerability!

Note: We reported some years ago the same issue that was also present in keepass and kaspersky password manager on exports via html and has been successfully resolved.
