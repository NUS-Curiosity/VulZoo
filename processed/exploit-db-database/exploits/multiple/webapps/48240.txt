Summary: Imagine that you live in a house where everything happens by itself.
FIBARO Smart Home takes care of your everyday comfort and safety of all family
members and in the meantime, saves energy on every single occasion. All this is
possible thanks to Home Center 2 smart home HUB. Home Center 2 is an indispensable
part of the FIBARO System without which the rest devices of home automation would
be only beautiful objects. The smart home HUB collects and analyzes information
about devices, communicates them with each other and thus directs the operation
of the entire system and takes care of its security.

Desc: The smart home solution is vulnerable to a remote Cross-Site Scripting
triggered via a Remote File Inclusion issue by including arbitrary client-side
dynamic scripts (JavaScript, VBScript) due to the undocumented proxy API and its
url GET parameter. This allows hijacking the current session of the user or
changing the look of the page by changing the HTML.

Tested on: Apache/2.2.16 (Debian)
           nginx/1.9.5
           nginx/1.8.0
           lighttpd/1.4.41
