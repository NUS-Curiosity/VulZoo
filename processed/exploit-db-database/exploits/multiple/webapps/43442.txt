FTP Service Multiple Vulnerabilities

Vendor: Pablo Software Solutions
Product: FTP Service
Version: <= 1.2
Website: http://www.pablovandermeer.nl/ftp_service.html

BID: 7799 7801

Description:
FTPService.exe is a service-version of Pablo's FTP Server. This service enables you to have the FTP server active even when you're not logged into Windows.

Anonymous Access
The anonymous account is by default set to have download access to anything in the C:\ directory. While this can be disabled by simply deleting the anonymous account, it poses a serious threat for anyone not aware of the problem.

ftp://somewhere/windows/repair/sam

In conclusion this application is totally open to complete compromise by default. Vendor was notified and plans on releasing a fix soon.

Plaintext Password Weakness:
User info is stored in users.dat in plaintext. If the anonymous account is present (it is by default) the entire FTP server can be compromised

ftp://somewhere/program files/pablo's ftp service/users.dat

Solution:
Upgrade your version of Pablo FTP Service.
