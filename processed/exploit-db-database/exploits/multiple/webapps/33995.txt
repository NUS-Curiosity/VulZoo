Blaze Apps is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may exploit the HTML-injection issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is displayed, and launch other attacks.

The attacker may exploit the SQL-injection issues to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Blaze Apps 1.4.0.051909 and prior are vulnerable.
