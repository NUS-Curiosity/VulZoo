Keene Digital Media Server is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. These issues span multiple scripts. The source of the problem is that affected scripts do not sufficiently sanitize externally supplied data before rendering it to a client user. An attacker may exploit these issues by enticing a victim user to follow a malicious link.

These issues could be exploited to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or launch other attacks.
