FOREGROUND SECURITY, SECURITY ADVISORY 2011-002
- Original release date: September 21, 2011
- Discovered by: Jose Carlos de Arriba - Senior Security Analyst at Foreground Security
- Contact: (jcarriba (at) foregroundsecurity (dot) com, dade (at) painsec (dot) com)
- Severity: 9.7/10 (Base CVSS Score)
============================================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Authenex A-Key/ASAS Web Management Control 3.1.0.2 (latest) - Time-based SQL Injection.

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Authenex provides enterprises and enterprise IT managers and staff with a wide range of products that help keep both their networks and data secure. Authenex solutions enable users to securely and efficiently access network assets and personal, sensitive data anytime, anywhere. The Authenex suite of applications can be leveraged by a variety of USB and non-USB tokens.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
The Authenex Web Management Control allows users of Authenex A-Key (OTP Tokens for 2-factor authentication) and ASAS products to manage their OTP tokens and change user information (credentials, activate tokens, etc).

The Authenex Strong Authentication System (ASAS�) is a network security application that provides strong (two-factor) authentication for LAN, remote, VPN and web access. The ASASR System helps keep your networks secure by requiring your users to use their A-Key� tokens to authenticate via One-Time Password (OTP) whenever they want remote or LAN access to networks, web sites, portals, OWA servers, etc. The ASASR System utilizes an authentication server and database, as well as the A-Key� token as the basis for the most secure, easy to use, simple to administer and cost-effective two-factor authentication solution available today.

The A-Key� 4800 tokens are USB tokens that enable users to store data in encrypted memory (4 or 8 gigabytes) and safely take that data wherever they go. All data on an A-Key� token is safe from unauthorized use and from theft. The A-Key� token is password-protected and all data is encrypted. Also, the token has brute force penetration protection: if someone tries to log in to the token and fails a predefined number of times, the token will self-erase. This feature resides at the hardware level and cannot be altered.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

V. BUSINESS IMPACT

An attacker would be able access the Authenex database, dump all the OTP tokens, users information including credentials, etc.

Also, depending upon the database configuration the attacker would be able to access other databases or get a shell on the system.
