Vantage Point Security Advisory 2015-001
========================================

Title: Cisco Unified Communications Manager Multiple Vulnerabilities
Vendor: Cisco
Vendor URL: http://www.cisco.com/
Versions affected:  <9.2, <10.5.2, <11.0.1.
Severity: Low to medium
Vendor notified: Yes
Reported: Oct. 2014
Public release: Aug. 13th, 2015
Author: Bernhard Mueller <bernhard[at]vantagepoint[dot]sg>

Summary:
--------

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) offers services such as session
management, voice, video, messaging, mobility, and web conferencing.

During the last year, Vantage Point Security has reported four security
issues to Cisco as listed below.


1. Shellshock command injection
--------------------------------

Authenticated users of CUCM can access limited functionality via the web
interface and Cisco console (SSH on port 22). Because the SSH server is
configured to process several environment variables from the client and a
vulnerable version of bash is used, it is possible to exploit command
injection via specially crafted environment variables (CVE-2014-6271 a.k.a.
shellshock). This allows an attacker to spawn a shell running as the user
"admin".


Several environment variables can be used to exploit the issue. Example:


$ LC_PAPER="() { x;};/bin/sh" ssh Administrator@examplecucm.com


2. Local File Inclusion
-----------------------

The application allows users to view the contents of any locally accessible
files on the web server through a vulnerability known as LFI (Local File
Inclusion). LFI vulnerabilities are commonly used to download application
source code, configuration files and files containing sensitive information
such as passwords. Exploiting this issue requires a valid user account.

3. Unauthenticated access to ping command
-----------------------------------------

The pingExecute servlet allows unauthenticated users to execute pings to
arbitrary IP addresses. This could be used by an attacker to enumerate the
internal network. The following URL triggers a ping of the host 10.0.0.1:

https://cucm.example.com:8443/cmplatform/pingExecute?hostname=10.0.0.1&interval=1.0&packetsize=12&count=1000&secure=false


4. Magic session ID allows unauthenticated access to SOAP calls
---------------------------------------------------------------

Authentication for some methods in the EPAS SOAP interface can be bypassed
by using a hardcoded session ID. The methods "GetUserLoginInfoHandler" and
"GetLoggedinXMPPUserHandler" are affected.


Fix Information:
----------------

Upgrade to CUCM version 9.2, 10.5.2 or 11.0.1.
