 Details
=======

This is an authenticated Stored XSS, hence the user needs to be logged in
to exploit this issue.

A malicious user (admin/regular) can initiate a website scan in the Arachni
Web UI. After initiating the scan, there is an option of users to comment
onto it (with Markdown formatting). However using Markdown the malicious
user can craft a link that will execute arbitrary Javascript once clicked.

The proof of concept XSS comment: [XSS](javascript:alert('XSS'))

The above comment will roughly translate into: <a
href="javascript:alert('XSS');">XSS</a>. Hence creating an anchor with
user-supplied Javascript content.
