Progress is a commercial database for Microsoft Windows and Unix systems.

A buffer overflow has been reported in the sqlcpp program included with Progress, used as a SQL preprocessor. Execution of arbitrary code is possible.

This issue has been reported to affect Unix systems. This vulnerability may also exist under Windows, this has not however been confirmed.

/*
 * Yet another Progress Database exploit (version ??)
 *
 * The vulnerability was found by KF / Snosoft (http://www.snosoft.com)
 * Exploit coded up by The Itch / Promisc (http://www.promisc.org)
 *
 * This exploit was developed on the Snosoft vulnerability research machines
 * mail dotslash@snosoft.com if you are interested in contributing research time
 *
 * - The Itch
 * - itchie@promisc.org
 *
 * - Technical details concerning the exploit -
 *
 * 1). Buffer overflow occurs after writing more then 56 bytes into the buffer at the command line
 *     (56 to overwrite ebp, 60 to overwrite eip).
 * 2). If you write more then 65 bytes, other frames will be overwritten afterwards and will mess up
 *     your flow of arbitrary code execution.
