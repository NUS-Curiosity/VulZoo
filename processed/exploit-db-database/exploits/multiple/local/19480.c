INN versions 2.2 and earlier have a buffer overflow-related security condition in the inews program.

inews is a program used to inject new postings into the news system. It is used by many news reading programs and scripts. The default installation is with inews setgid to the news group and world executable. It's possible that exploiting the buffer overflow could give the attacker news group privileges, which could possibly be extended to root access.

/* inews exploit , gives you the inews egid .

*
* RET addresses change between RH 5.2 ,6.0 etc..
*
* RH 5.2 RET = 0xbffff6f0
* RH 6.0 RET = 0xbffff6e0 :> pretty hard to guess huhuhu..
