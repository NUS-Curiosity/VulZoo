IBM OmniFind is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

IBM OmniFind versions 8.5 and 9.0 are affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 44740 (IBM OmniFind Multiple Vulnerabilities) but has been given its own record to better document it.
