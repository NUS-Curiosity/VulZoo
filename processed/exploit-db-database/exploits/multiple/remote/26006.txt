Oracle Reports Server is susceptible to an unauthorized report execution vulnerability.

By placing a report file in a globally accessible location, users can trigger the execution of the report by issuing an HTTP GET request to the affected servlet containing the full path of the file.

Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands, or read/write arbitrary files with the privileges of the Oracle account under which the server is executing.

It should be noted that this issue may be remotely exploited if an attacker has means to write files to the serving computer (WebDAV, FTP, CIFS, etc.) without local access.
