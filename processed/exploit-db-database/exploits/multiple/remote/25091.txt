Multiple remote vulnerabilities reportedly affect RealNetworks RealArcade. The first issue allows for arbitrary file deletion due to an input validation issue. The second issue is an integer overflow issue resulting in code execution.

Both of these issues require an unsuspecting user to download and activate a malicious file for exploitation.

Successful exploitation of these issues will facilitate code execution and file deletion with the privileges of an unsuspecting user that activates a malicious RealArcade file.
