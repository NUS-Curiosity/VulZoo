SAP Internet Transaction Server (ITS) is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this issue would allow an attacker to steal cookie-based credentials and to launch other attacks.

Versions 6.1 and 6.2 are reportedly vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
