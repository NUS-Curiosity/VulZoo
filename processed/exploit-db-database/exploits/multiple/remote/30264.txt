Fujitsu ServerView is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the affected application. Successful attacks will compromise the application and underlying webserver; other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to Fujitsu ServerView 4.50.09 are vulnerable.
