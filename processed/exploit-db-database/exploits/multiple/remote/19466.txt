Under certain versions of Mini SQL, the w3-msql CGI script allows users to view directories which are set for private access via .htaccess files. W3-mSQL converts any form data passed to a script into global Lite variables and these variables can then be accessed by your script code.

When an HTML form is defined a field name is given to each element of the form. When the data is passed to W3-mSQL the field names are used as the variable names for the global variables. Once a set of variables has been created for each form element, the values being passed to the script are assigned to the variables. This is done automatically during start-up of the W3-mSQL program.
