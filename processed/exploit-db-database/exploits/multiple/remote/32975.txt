GlassFish Enterprise Server is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials.

GlassFish Enterprise Server 2.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
