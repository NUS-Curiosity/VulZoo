Apache Geronimo Application Server is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities:

- Multiple directory-traversal vulnerabilities
- A cross-site scripting vulnerability
- Multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities
- A cross-site request-forgery vulnerability

Attackers can exploit these issues to obtain sensitive information, upload arbitrary files, execute arbitrary script code, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and perform certain administrative actions.

Apache Geronimo 2.1 through 2.1.3 are vulnerable.
