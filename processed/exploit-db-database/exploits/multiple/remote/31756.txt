SonicWALL Email Security is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying URI address data in an error page.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

SonicWALL Email Security 6.1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

GET /blah.htm HTTP/1.1 Host: "><script>alert('XSS');</script>
