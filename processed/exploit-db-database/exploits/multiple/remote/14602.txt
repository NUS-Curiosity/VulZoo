An attacker can download any file that the owner of the Play! process can read.

Simply browse to:

http://127.0.0.1:9000/public/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd

The '/public' directory must be a directory with a 'staticDir' mapping in the 'conf/routes' configuration file.
Typically an images or css directory on the server.
