It has been reported that Null HTTPd is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability when displaying error pages that may allow an attacker to execute HTML or script code in a user's browser. The issue was previously reported and fixed (BID 5603), however an attacker may send a long HTTP request to the software, which may overwrite memory containing the fix for cross-site scripting issue. As a result, an attacker may bypass the check for cross-site scripting and construct a link containing malicious HTML and script code to be rendered in a user's browser upon visiting that link.

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

Null HTTPd version 0.5.1 and prior are reported to be prone to this issue.
