Spring Security is prone to a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers because it fails to sufficiently sanitize input.

By inserting arbitrary headers into an HTTP response, attackers may be able to launch various attacks, including cross-site request forgery, cross-site scripting, and HTTP-request smuggling.

The following versions are vulnerable:

Spring Security 2.0.0 through 2.0.6
Spring Security 3.0.0 through 3.0.5
