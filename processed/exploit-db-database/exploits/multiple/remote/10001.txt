CUPS is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the software fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may let the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

NOTE: This vulnerability was originally reported in BID 36956 (Apple Mac OS X 2009-006 Multiple Security Vulnerabilities), but has been given its own record to better document it.

This issue affects versions prior to CUPS 1.4.2.
