PostMaster has been reported prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The issue presents itself due to a lack of sufficient sanitization that is performed by the proxy service on user-supplied data. An attacker may construct a malicious HTTP request link that contains embedded HTML and script code. When this request is handled by the proxy service, the malicious HTML and script code contained in the request will be incorporated into an error page and in turn will be rendered in the browser of a user who follows the link.
