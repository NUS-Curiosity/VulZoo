Terminator 3 : War of the Machines server is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability that may permit remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system, this may facilitate unauthorized access. This issue arises because the application fails to perform boundary checks prior to copying user-supplied data into sensitive process buffers.

Terminator 3: War of the Machines version 1.16 is affected by this issue.
