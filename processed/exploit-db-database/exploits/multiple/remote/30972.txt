Camtasia Studio is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit will allow an attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

NOTE: This vulnerability was initially considered a cross-site scripting issue, but further analysis reveals that this is a remote code-execution vulnerability.
