Outpost Security Suite Pro is prone to a vulnerability that allows an unauthorized attacker to bypass antivirus and firewall rules. This issue occurs because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits can allow malicious data to evade expected detection rules, giving legitimate users a false sense of security. Other attacks may also be possible.

Outpost Security Suite Pro 2009 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
