IBM Java is prone to a security-bypass vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits can allow attackers to bypass filtering mechanisms; this may aid in further attacks.

Versions prior to IBM Java SDK 1.4.2 SR13-FP6, Java SE 5.0.0-SR12, and Java SE 6.0.0-SR9 are vulnerable.
