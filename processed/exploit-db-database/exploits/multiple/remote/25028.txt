It is reported that csv2xml is susceptible to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly bounds check user-supplied data prior to copying it into a fixed-size memory buffer.

This vulnerability allow remote attackers to alter the proper flow of execution of the application, potentially resulting in the execution of attacker-supplied machine code in the context of the application attempting to read malicious data.
