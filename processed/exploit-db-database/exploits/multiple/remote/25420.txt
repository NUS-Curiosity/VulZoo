A remote JSP source disclosure vulnerability reportedly affects the IBM WebSphere Application Server. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly handle various requests under certain circumstances.

It should be noted that this issue only arises when the Web serve and application server root directories reside in the same location; this is not the default configuration.

An attacker may leverage this issue to disclose JSP source code, facilitating code theft as well as potential further attacks.
