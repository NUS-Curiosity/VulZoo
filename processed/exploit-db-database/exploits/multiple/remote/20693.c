Apache HTTPD is the Apache Web Server, freely distributed and actively maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. It is a freely available and widely used software package, included with various implementations of the UNIX operating system and can be used on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

A problem in the package could allow directory indexing and path discovery. In a default configuration, Apache enables mod_dir, mod_autoindex, and mod_negotiation. However, by sending the Apache server a custom-crafted request consisting of a long path name created artificially by using numerous slashes, an attacker can cause these modules to misbehave, allowing the attacker to escape the error page and to gain a listing of the directory contents.

This vulnerability allows a malicious remote user to launch an information-gathering attack, which could potentially result in a compromise of the system. Additionally, this vulnerability affects all releases of Apache previous to 1.3.19.

/*
Program: apacheslash.c
Original Date: 2-21-02
Version: 1.0
Platform: Linux (compiled on SuSE 7.3)
c0der: st0ic
site: www.fsix.net
e-mail: st0ic@blackcodemail.com

Revised:
	NONE thus far

Description: This program tests an Apache installation for the "Apache Artificially Long Slash Path
Directory Listing Exploit."  See SecurityFocus.com BID 2503 - http://online.securityfocus.com/bid/2503

Compile: gcc apacheslash.c -o apacheslash

Stuff: I know theres already 3 Perl scripts that test this bug out, but there execution time is horrible
so I was bored and decided to recode it in C for execution speed sake. On my box, I think it took
about 8 mins to send 1000 /'s to apache with apache2.pl. It takes about 2 seconds with this program.
BTW, SuSE 7.3 comes with Apache 1.3.20, which is NOT vulnerable :-). Check out the securityfocus.com
BID 2503 to find out whats vulnerable and whats not.

I also included the comments from apache2.pl exploit which was modified
by Siberian of sentry-labs.com. Read below for the details:

#
# Note: This isn't the orginal exploit! This one was modified and partly rewritten.
#
# Changes:
#
# - help added (more user firendly :-) )
# - messages added
# - exploit is now able to be executed on WinNT or 2k.
# - uses perl version of BSD sockets (compatible to Windows)
#
# Rewriter's Note: I rewrote (I was bored to death that evening :-) ) some
# of the code and made it esaier to use and cross platform compatible.
# The old verion used a esaier but not that compaible way of socket stream communication.
# Any network code was replaced by cross platform compatible BSD sockets.
# (much better than any other stream method :-) )
#
# Tested with Perl 5.6 (Linux) and ActivePerl 5.6 (Win32)

# Name: Apache Artificially Long Slash Path Directory Listing Exploit
# Author: Matt Watchinski
# Ref: SecurityFocus BID 2503
#
# Affects: Apache 1.3.17 and below
# Tested on: Apache 1.3.12 running on Debian 2.2
#
# Info:  This exploit tricks apache into returning a Index of the a directory
#    even if an index.html file is present.  May not work on some OS's
#
# Details: http_request.c has a subroutine called ap_sub_req_lookup_file that in
#	   very specific cases would feed stat() a filename that was longer than
#	   stat() could handle.  This would result in a condition where stat()
#	   would return 0 and a directory index would be returned instead of the
#	   default index.html.
#
# Code Fragment: /src/main/http_request.c
#    if (strchr(new_file, '/') == NULL) {
#        char *udir = ap_make_dirstr_parent(rnew->pool, r->uri);
#
#        rnew->uri = ap_make_full_path(rnew->pool, udir, new_file);
#        rnew->filename = ap_make_full_path(rnew->pool, fdir, new_file);
#        ap_parse_uri(rnew, rnew->uri);    /* fill in parsed_uri values */	/*
#        if (stat(rnew->filename, &rnew->finfo) < 0) {   <-- Important part
#            rnew->finfo.st_mode = 0;
#        }
#
# Conditions: Mod_dir / Mod_autoindex / Mod_negotiation need to be enabled
#	      The directory must also have the following Options enabled:
#             Indexes and MultiView
#	      Some OS's have different conditions on the number of character
#	      you have to pass to stat to make this work.  If stat doesn't
#	      return 0 for path names less than 8192 or so internal apache
#	      buffer checks will stop this exploit from working.
#
# 	      Debian needed around 4060 /'s to make this work.
#
# Greets: Special thanks to natasha who added a lot of debug to apache for me
#	  while i was trying to figure out what had to be enabled to make this
#	  exploit work.  Also thanks to rfp for pointing out that MultiView
#	  needed to be enabled.
#
# More Greets:  Jeff for not shooting me :) <All your Cisco's belong to us>
#               Anne for being so sexy <I never though corporate espionage
#                   would be so fun>
#               All my homies at farm9
#               DJ Charles / DJ NoloN for the phat beats
#               Marty (go go gadget snort)
#               All my ex-bees
#               RnVjazpIaXZlcndvcmxk
#
# I think that wraps it up.  Have fun.
