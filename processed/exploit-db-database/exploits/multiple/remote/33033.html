WebKit is prone to a cross-domain scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly restrict the access of JavaScript code when loading new webpages.

A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the same-origin policy and obtain potentially sensitive information or to launch spoofing attacks against other sites. Other attacks are also possible.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 35260 (Apple Safari Prior to 4.0 Multiple Security Vulnerabilities), but has been assigned its own record to better document it.
