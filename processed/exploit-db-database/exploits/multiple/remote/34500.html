Flock Browser is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits will allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to Flock 3.0.0.4094 are vulnerable.
