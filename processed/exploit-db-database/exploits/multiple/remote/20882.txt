Freestyle Chat server from Faust Informatics incorporates interactive chat functionality into websites.

Versions of Freestyle Chat are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks. This can allow a remote user to request files from outside the normal webserver directory scope.

Properly exploited, this could provide information useful in further attacks on the vulnerable host.
