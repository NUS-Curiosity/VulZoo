A buffer overflow vulnerability in SmartDesk WebSuite 2.1 allows malicious remote users to crash the server, and may at worst allow them to execute arbitrary code.

WebSuite 2.1 will crash when the filename requested is overly long. Test showed the filename length that crashed the server varied from 250 to over 2,000 bytes long.

On Windows 98, append 150 to 1,000+ characters to the URL.

On Windows NT, append 250 to 2,000+ characters to the URL.

example:

http://hostname/00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
