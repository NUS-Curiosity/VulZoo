Axis StorPoint CD and Axis StorPoint CD/T are CD ROM servers (actual hardware units)sold by Axis Communications. Both of these appliances support remote management
via SNMP MIB-II and private enterprise MIB as well as from the web via a system-supplied webserver. In regards to the web based administration, users can completely bypass authentication (username and password) by using a specified URL. The actual login page is located at:

http://server/config/html/cnf_gi.htm

However, by using:

http://server/cd/../config/html/cnf_gi.htm

A user side steps the login page and gains administrative access to the appliance.
