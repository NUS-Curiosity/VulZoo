Adobe Flash Player is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue by tricking an unsuspecting victim into opening a malicious file.

A successful exploit will result in the execution of arbitrary attacker-supplied code in the context of the victim running the vulnerable application.

Adobe Flash Player 9.0.45.0 and earlier, 8.0.34.0 and earlier, and 7.0.69.0 and earlier are affected.
