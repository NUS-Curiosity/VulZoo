The APC Network Management Card is prone to multiple cross-site request-forgery and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit the cross-site request forgery issues to alter the settings on affected devices, which may lead to further network-based attacks.

The attacker can exploit the cross-site scripting issues to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to the following are vulnerable:

Network Management Card Firmware 3.7.2
Network Management Card Firmware 5.1.1
