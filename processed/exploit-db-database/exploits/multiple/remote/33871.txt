Tiny Java Web Server is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input. These vulnerabilities include a directory-traversal vulnerability, an open-redirection vulnerability, and a source code information-disclosure vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues can allow an attacker to retrieve arbitrary local files and view directories within the context of the webserver. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks. A successful exploit may aid in phishing attacks; other attacks may also be possible.

Tiny Java Web Server 1.71 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
