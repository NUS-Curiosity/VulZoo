foomatic-gui is prone to a remote arbitrary shell-command-execution vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary shell commands in the context of the application.

Versions prior to foomatic-gui 0.7.9.5 are vulnerable.
