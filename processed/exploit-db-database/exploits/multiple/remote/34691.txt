CollabNet Subversion Edge is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

CollabNet Subversion Edge 1.2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example request is available:
GET /csvn/login</pre><script>alert('pwndd!!!!');</script> HTTP/1.0
