Apache Mina 2.0.13 uses the OGNL library in the “IoSessionFinder” class. Its constructor takes into parameter one OGNL expression. Then this expression is executed when the method “find” is called. This class seems to be only used in the JMX MINA component “IoServiceMBean”. When the IOServiceMBean is exposed trough JMX it is possible to abuse the function to execute an arbitrary command on the server.
