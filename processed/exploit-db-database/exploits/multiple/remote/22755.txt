A weakness has been discovered in Aiglon Web Server, which may provide for the disclosure of sensitive information to remote attackers.

It has been reported that a remote attacker may cause the web server to disclose installation path details by making a malformed HTTP request. The remote attacker may potentially use the disclosed information to aid in further "intelligent" attacks against the host running the affected software.
