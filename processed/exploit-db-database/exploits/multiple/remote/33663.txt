IBM WebSphere Portal is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An authenticated attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

IBM WebSphere Portal 6.0.1.5 Build Level wp6015_008_01 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following code can trigger this issue:

" style="position:absolute; top:-100px; left:-100px; width:10000 px; height:10000px; z-index:999;" onmousemove="alert('XSS')"&gt;
