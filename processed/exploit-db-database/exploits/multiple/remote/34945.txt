Home File Share Server is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to view arbitrary local files within the context of the webserver. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

Home File Share Server 0.7.2.32 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
