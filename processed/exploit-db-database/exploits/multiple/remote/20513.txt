iCat Electronic Commerce Suite is an application which enables a user to create and manage web based catalogues.

A remote user may retrieve known files on a target system running iCat Electronic Commerce Suite. The Carbo Server component of the Electronic Commerce Suite does not properly validate HTTP requests for files and will grant access to any object residing on the system. For example, the following HTTP request will display the file specified:

http://target/carbo.dll?icatcommand=..\..\directory/filename.ext&catalogname=catalog

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may disclose sensitive information such as usernames and passwords and aid in the development of further attacks.

http://target/carbo.dll?icatcommand=..\..\directory/filename.ext&catalogname=catalog
