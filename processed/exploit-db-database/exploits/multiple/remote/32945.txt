010 Editor is prone to multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Successfully exploiting these issues may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed exploit attempts will cause denial-of-service conditions.

UPDATE (April 22, 2009): Since script files and templates may include script code used to automate editor functions, the privilege gained by a successful exploit is disputed. Please see the references for more information. We will update this BID as more information emerges.

Versions prior to 010 Editor 3.0.5 are vulnerable.
