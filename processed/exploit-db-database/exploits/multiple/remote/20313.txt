Allaire JRun is a web application development suite with JSP and Java Servlets.

Each web application directory contains a WEB-INF directory, this directory contains information on web application classes, pre-compiled JSP files, server side libraries, session information and files such as web.xml and webapp.properties.

JRun contains a vulnerability which allows remote user to view the contents of the WEB-INF directory. By requesting a malformed URL comprised of an additional '/' all of the directories below the WEB-INF directory will be revealed.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a remote attacker gaining read access to any file within the WEB-INF directory.

While this issue was addressed in earlier patches, it is still a problem if the attacker makes a raw specially crafted HTTP GET Request through a Microsoft IIS connector using a utility such as netcat or telnet.

The following request will disclose the contents of WEB-INF:

http://target//WEB-INF/

This may also be exploited by submitting the maliciously crafted URL via a HTTP GET request using utilities like netcat or telnet.
