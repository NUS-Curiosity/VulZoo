Mephistoles 'httpd' daemon fails to sanitize user-supplied input, making it vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to construct a malicious link containing HTML or script code that may be rendered in a user's browser upon visiting that link. This attack would occur in the security context of the affected server.
