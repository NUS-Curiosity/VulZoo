Oracle Forms Services is susceptible to an unauthorized form execution vulnerability.

Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Oracle account under which the server is executing.

It should be noted that this issue may be remotely exploited if an attacker has means to write files to the serving computer (WebDAV, FTP, CIFS, etc.) without local access.
