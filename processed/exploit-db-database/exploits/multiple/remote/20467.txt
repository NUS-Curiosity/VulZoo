A vulnerability exists in version 3.0 of Ultrseek server (aka Inktomi Search).

Due to a failure to properly validate user-supplied input, URLs submitted by a remote user of the form:

http://target:8765/somefile.html/

will return the source to 'somefile.html'.

As a result, it is possible for an attacker to obtain source code to any Ultraseek scripts, which could be used to support further attacks.
