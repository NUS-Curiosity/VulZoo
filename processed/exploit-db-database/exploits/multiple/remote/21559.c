When processing requests coded with the 'Chunked Encoding' mechanism, Apache fails to properly calculate required buffer sizes. This is believed to be due to improper (signed) interpretation of an unsigned integer value. Consequently, several conditions that have security implications may occur. Reportedly, a buffer overrun and signal race condition occur. Exploiting these conditions may allow arbitrary code to run.

**Update**: Reportedly, at least one worm is exploiting this vulnerability to propagate in the wild. The worm targets FreeBSD 4.5 systems running Apache 1.3.22-24 and 1.3.20. Other versions may also be affected.

 * Remote OpenBSD/Apache exploit for the "chunking" vulnerability. Kudos to
 * the OpenBSD developers (Theo, DugSong, jnathan, *@#!w00w00, ...) and
 * their crappy memcpy implementation that makes this 32-bit impossibility
 * very easy to accomplish. This vulnerability was recently rediscovered by a slew
 * of researchers.
 *
 * The "experts" have already concurred that this bug...
 *      -       Can not be exploited on 32-bit *nix variants
 *      -       Is only exploitable on win32 platforms
 *      -       Is only exploitable on certain 64-bit systems
 *
 * However, contrary to what ISS would have you believe, we have
 * successfully exploited this hole on the following operating systems:
 *
 *      Sun Solaris 6-8 (sparc/x86)
 *      FreeBSD 4.3-4.5 (x86)
 *      OpenBSD 2.6-3.1 (x86)
 *      Linux (GNU) 2.4 (x86)
 *
 * Don't get discouraged too quickly in your own research. It took us close
 * to two months to be able to exploit each of the above operating systems.
 * There is a peculiarity to be found for each operating system that makes the
 * exploitation possible.
 *
 * Don't email us asking for technical help or begging for warez. We are
 * busy working on many other wonderful things, including other remotely
 * exploitable holes in Apache. Perhaps The Great Pr0ix would like to inform
 * the community that those holes don't exist? We wonder who's paying her.
 *
 * This code is an early version from when we first began researching the
 * vulnerability. It should spawn a shell on any unpatched OpenBSD system
 * running the Apache webserver.
 *
 * We appreciate The Blue Boar's effort to allow us to post to his mailing
 * list once again. Because he finally allowed us to post, we now have this
 * very humble offering.
 *
 * This is a very serious vulnerability. After disclosing this exploit, we
 * hope to have gained immense fame and glory.
 *
 * Testbeds: synnergy.net, monkey.org, 9mm.com
 *
 * Abusing the right syscalls, any exploit against OpenBSD == root. Kernel
 * bugs are great.

 * --- you just know 28923034839303 admins out there running
 *     OpenBSD/Apache are going "ugh..not exploitable..ill do it after the
 *     weekend"
 * --- "Five years without a remote hole in the default install". default
 *      package = kernel. if theo knew that talkd was exploitable, he'd cry.
 * --- so funny how apache.org claims it's impossible to exploit this.
 * --- how many times were we told, "ANTISEC IS NOT FOR YOU" ?
 * --- I hope Theo doesn't kill himself
 * --- heh, this is a middle finger to all those open source, anti-"m$"
 *     idiots... slashdot hippies...
 * --- they rushed to release this exploit so they could update their ISS
 *     scanner to have a module for this vulnerability, but it doesnt even
 *     work... it's just looking for win32 apache versions
 * --- no one took us seriously when we mentioned this last year. we warned
 *     them that moderation == no pie.
 * --- now try it against synnergy :>
 * --- ANOTHER BUG BITE THE DUST... VROOOOM VRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOM
 *
 * xxxx  this thing is a major exploit. do you really wanna publish it?
 * oooo  i'm not afraid of whitehats
 * xxxx  the blackhats will kill you for posting that exploit
 * oooo  blackhats are a myth
 * oooo  so i'm not worried
 * oooo  i've never seen one
 * oooo  i guess it's sort of like having god in your life
 * oooo  i don't believe there's a god
 * oooo  but if i sat down and met him
 * oooo  i wouldn't walk away thinking
 * oooo  "that was one hell of a special effect"
 * oooo  so i suppose there very well could be a blackhat somewhere
