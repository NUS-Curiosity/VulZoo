Interbase is an open source relational database offered by Borland Inprise Corporation.

Interbase contains a backdoor user account and password called "LOCKSMITH". When accessed this account will eliminate all implemented security allowing full control of any database and contents within the database, this level of access will allow any function to be performed including modification of objects, root access and execution of arbitrary functions. "LOCKSMITH" is hard coded in the database engine and is located in the jrd/pwd.h header.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will lead to complete compromise of the host.
