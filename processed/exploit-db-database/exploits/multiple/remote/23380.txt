It has been reported that a cross-site scripting vulnerability may exist in WebWasher Classic that may allow remote attackers to execute HTML or script code in a user's browser. The issue is reported to occur due to error messages returned to the user. User-supplied data is not properly sanitized therefore allowing an attacker to a construct a malicious link containing HTML or script code that may be rendered in a user's browser.

WebWasher Classic versions 3.3 Build 44 and 2.2.1 are reported to be prone to this issue, however other versions may be affected as well.
