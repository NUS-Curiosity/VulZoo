WWW File Share Pro has been reported prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities.

The first reported issue is that a remote attacker may employ the "upload" functionality of the vulnerable software to overwrite arbitrary files that are writable by the WWW File Share Pro process.

The second issue reported, may allow a remote user to deny service to the affected software. It has been reported that if WWW File Share Pro handles a POST request that contains excessive data it will consume system resources and leave the affected system unresponsive.

The final issue that has been reported regards the access control routines used to control access to directories that are protected by WWW File Share Pro. It has been reported that a remote attacker may invoke a specially crafted HTTP request for the target protected resource and in doing so may bypass access controls.

    Exploit:
    - CPU up to 100%
    - CLOSE_WAIT for each connection, until cannot be allocated more sockets
    - eat all the memory the attacker wants
    - on some machines (Win for example) it "could" be a fast DoS because the
      sockets will be finished quickly

    Example of what happen to the system with 10 connections of 512 Kb:
    "10 --> 5242880" == webs allocates 5948 Kb of memory
