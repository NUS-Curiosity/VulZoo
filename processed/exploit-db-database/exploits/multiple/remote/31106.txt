WinComLPD Total is prone to multiple vulnerabilities, including buffer-overflow vulnerabilities and an authentication-bypass vulnerability.

Successfully exploiting these issues will allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely crash the application.

These issues affect WinComLPD Total 3.0.2.623; other versions may also be vulnerable.
