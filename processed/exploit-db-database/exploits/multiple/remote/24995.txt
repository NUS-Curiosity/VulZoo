A remote, client-side buffer overflow vulnerability reportedly affects the DXFscope utility. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to using it as the format specifier string in a formatted printing function.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges on an unsuspecting user that uses the vulnerable application to process a malicious DXF formatted file. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
