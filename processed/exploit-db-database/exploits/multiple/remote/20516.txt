BEA Systems WebLogic Server is an enterprise level web and wireless application server.

Unchecked buffers exist in a particular handler for URL requests that begin with two dots "..". Depending on the data entered into the buffer, WebLogic Server could be forced to crash or arbitrary code could be executed on the system in the security context of the web server.
