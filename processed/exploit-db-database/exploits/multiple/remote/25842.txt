JBoss is prone to a remote information-disclosure vulnerability. The issue occurs in the 'org.jboss.web.WebServer' class and is due to a lack of sufficient sanitization of user-supplied request data.

Information that attackers can harvest through leveraging this issue may aid in further attacks against the affected service.
