# cyrus-imapd pop3d exploit
# by bannedit
#
# 05/23/2006
#	This exploit takes advantage of a stack based overflow.
#	Once the stack corruption has occured it is possible
#	to overwrite a pointer which is later used for a memcpy
#	this gives us a write anything anywhere condition similar
#	to a format string vulnerability.
#
#	I choose to overwrite the GOT table with my shellcode and
#	return to it. This defeats the VA random patch and possibly
#	other stack protection features.
#
#	tested on gentoo-sources linux 2.6.16
