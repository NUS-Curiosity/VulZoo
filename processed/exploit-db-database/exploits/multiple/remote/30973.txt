InfoSoft FusionCharts is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute malicious script code in the context of the webserver process. This may allow the attacker to compromise the application and the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.
