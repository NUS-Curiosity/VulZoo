Oracle has released a Critical Patch Update advisory for January 2007 to address these vulnerabilities for supported releases. Earlier unsupported releases are likely to be affected by these issues as well.

The issues identified by the vendor affect all security properties of the Oracle products and present local and remote threats. Various levels of authorization are needed to leverage some of the issues, but other issues do not require any authorization. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could possibly expose affected computers to complete compromise.
