Glub Tech Secure FTP is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. This issue occurs in the FTP client.

Exploiting these issues will allow an attacker to write arbitrary files to locations outside of the application's current directory. This could help the attacker launch further attacks.

Secure FTP 2.5.15 for Microsoft Windows is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
