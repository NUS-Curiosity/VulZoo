RealServer is a popular streaming audio and video server from Real Networks.

A vulnerability exists in all versions of RealServer 7 and below that could allow a remote attacker to gain administrative rights and access to server information and data belonging to other user sessions. RealServer will pass random pieces of the server's runtime memory which may contain information on previous sessions including cookies, usernames, passwords and the port number where the administrative server listens. This can be achieved by passing a specific URL request to the server.


To gather exploitable information from the RealServer, issue the following URL request to the server:
