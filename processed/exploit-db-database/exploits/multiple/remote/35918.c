IBM DB2 is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers execute arbitrary code.

An attacker can exploit this issue to gain elevated privileges and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Successfully exploiting this issue will result in a complete compromise of the affected system.

IBM DB2 9.7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
