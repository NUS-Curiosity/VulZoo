Apache Tomcat Host Manager Servlet is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject HTML and script code into the browser of an unsuspecting victim. The attacker may then steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Apache Tomcat 5.5.0 through 5.5.24 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.13 are affected.
