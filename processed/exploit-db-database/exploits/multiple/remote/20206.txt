The web server supplied with the QNX Voyager demo disk contains several vulnerabilities.

First, Voyager will follow relative paths passed to it in requests. This includes ../ style paths, which will allow Voyager to serve pages outside of the "document root".
Another vulnerability is that the web server does not have sufficient security restrictions - this means that the web server can access any file, including protected files and special /dev entries.

As well, due to the integration of the web browser and web server, information used by the Photon GUI is easily exposed by requesting files under /.photon/. Additionally, html files generated by the web browser (error messages, for example) and the QNX configuration interface share the same directory as published html files.

While the Voyager web server is not intended to be used in a production environment, and is in fact intended only to be a demo of the QNX OS, users should be aware of these design errors.
