IBM Lotus Notes Traveler is prone to a URI-redirection vulnerability, multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Successful exploits will allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, to control how the site is rendered to the user and conduct phishing attacks. Other attacks are also possible.

IBM Lotus Notes Traveler 8.5.3 and prior are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
