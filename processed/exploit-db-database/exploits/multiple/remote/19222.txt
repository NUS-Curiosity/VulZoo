A vulnerability in Gordano's NTMail allows remote malicious users to steal local files.

Gordano's NTMail is a Windows NT mail server program. One of its features is allowing administrators to configure the server and users to read their email with a web browser via a built-in web server.

The web server fails to check whether requested files fall outside its document tree (by using ".." in the URL). Thus attackers can retrieve files in the same drives as that on which the software resides if they know or can get it's filename.
