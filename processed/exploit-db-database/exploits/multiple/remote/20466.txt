Apache Web Server is subject to disclose files to unauthorized users when used in conjunction with the PHP3 script language.

By requesting a specially crafted URL by way of php, it is possible for a remote user to gain read access to a known file that resides on the target host.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information and possibly assist in further attacks against the victim.
