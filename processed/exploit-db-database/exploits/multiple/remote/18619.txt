ISOWAREZ RELEASE
By KINGCOPE - YEAR 2012

-== Apache Tomcat Remote Exploit and Account Scanner ==-

the modified pnscan scanner utility scans a range of IPs to find open
apache tomcat servers
by trying the following login access combinations:

tomcat:tomcat
password:password
admin:admin
admin:password
admin:<nopassword>
tomcat:<nopassword>

the included perl script can be used to unlock apache tomcat servers
remotely by using the collected login combinations.
it will retrieve either a root or SYSTEM reverse shell depending on
the operating system
or the equivalent of a reverse shell as the current user tomcat is running as.
the exploit might contain metasploit logic (thanks to jduck).

Enjoy :>
