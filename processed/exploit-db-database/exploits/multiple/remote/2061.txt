Overview:
Apache Tomcat is the servlet container that is used in the official Reference Implementation
for the Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages technologies.

Vulnerabilities:
Apache Tomcat can be forced to reveal a complete directory listing for any directory by requesting
a mapped file extension prepended with a semicolon, a reserved character. The file does not need to exist.

Examples:
http://www.sitexyz.com/;index.jsp
http://www.sitexyz.com/help/;help.do
