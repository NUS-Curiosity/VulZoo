Lotus Domino Enterprise Server 5.0.1/5.0.2/5.0.3,Mail Server 5.0.1/5.0.2/5.0.3 Buffer Overflow

source: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1229/info

The code that handles the 'rcpt to' 'saml from' and 'soml from' commands in the ESMTP service of Lotus Domino Server has an unchecked buffer. If Lotus Domino Server receives an argument of more than 4 KB to the any of the listed commands, the system will crash and will require a reboot in order to regain normal functionality.
