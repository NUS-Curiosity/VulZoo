A vulnerability exists in version 3.0 of Ultrseek server (aka Inktomi Search).

Due to a failure to properly validate user-supplied input, URLs submitted by a remote user of the form:

http://target:8765/example/

will, if the file 'example' does not exist, return an error message which discloses sensitive path and server configuration information.

As a result, it is possible for an attacker to obtain information about the server's configuration and directory structure, which could be used to support further attacks.

This may be the result of a weak default configuration. Ultraseek Server returns detailed error information when requests are recieved from an administrative IP address. By default, administrative status is given to all addresses.
