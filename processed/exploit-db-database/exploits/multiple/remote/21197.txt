BSCW (Basic Support for Cooperative Work) is a web-based groupware application, allowing users to share a workspace via a web interface. It runs on Microsoft Windows NT/2000 systems, as well as a number of Unix variants.

The default installation allows users to self-register, potentially allowing untrusted users to access the service.

This may provide a window of opportunity for an untrusted, malicious user to access the service to exploit known issues. One example of an existing issue that may be exploited as a result of untrusted users being able to self-register is BugTraq ID 3776 "BSCW Remote Command Execution Vulnerability".
