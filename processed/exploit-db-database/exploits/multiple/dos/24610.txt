DNS4Me is reported to be susceptible to a denial of service vulnerability, and a cross-site scripting vulnerability. These vulnerabilities affect the built-in web server contained in the package.

The first vulnerability reportedly allows attackers to cause the web server to consume all available CPU resources, and eventually crash the application.

The second vulnerability is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI input. This issue could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link that includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were to be followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the security context of the affected web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

Although these vulnerabilities are reported to exist in version 3.0.0.4 of DNS4Me, other versions may also be affected.
