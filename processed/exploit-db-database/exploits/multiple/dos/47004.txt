CVE: CVE-2019-11705
CWE: 121

Advisory-URL: https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2019-003-thunderbird

Summary and Impact
==================
A stack-based buffer overflow has been identified in the Thunderbird email
client. The issue is present in the libical implementation, which was forked
from upstream libical version 0.47.
The issue can be triggered remotely, when an attacker sends an specially
crafted calendar attachment and does not require user interaction. It
might be used by a remote attacker to crash or gain remote code execution
in the client system.
X41 did not perform a full test or audit on the software.

Product Description
===================
Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring
client, that's easy to set up and customize.

Analysis
========
A stack-based buffer overflow in icalrecur.c icalrecur_add_bydayrules()
can be triggered while parsing a calendar attachment containing a malformed
or specially crafted string.
{% highlight c %}
static int icalrecuraddbydayrules(struct icalrecurparser *parser,
                                    const char *vals)
{
    short *array = parser->rt.byday;
    // ...
    while (n != 0) {
    // ...
        if (wd != ICALNOWEEKDAY) {
            array[i++] = (short) (sign * (wd + 8 * weekno));
            array[i] = ICALRECURRENCEARRAYMAX;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
Missing sanity checks in `icalrecuradd_bydayrules()can lead to
out of bounds write in aarraywhenweekno` takes an invalid value.
The issue manifests as an out-of-bounds write in a stack allocated
buffer overflow.
It is expected that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve
remote code execution when proper stack smashing mitigations are missing.

Proof of Concept
================
A reproducer eml file can be found in https://github.com/x41sec/advisories/tree/master/X41-2019-003

Workarounds
===========
A fix is available from upstream. Alternatively, libical can be replaced by icaljs,
a JavaScript implementation of ical parsing, by setting
calendar.icaljs = true in Thunderbird configuration.
