dsock <= 1.3 (buf) Remote Buffer Overflow PoC

Original Author:
Michael Adams <parasite [a] sdf.lonestar.org>

A buffer overflow in variable 'buf' exists due to insufficient validation
of variable 'name' in function tor_resolve line 218 of software at
http://www.monkey.org/~dugsong/dsocks/

At a quick glance, this looks like it could indeed be overflowed quite
trivially by passing an overlong name to any of the host lookup functions
proxied by dsocks.  It therefore seems that it could quite easily be
triggered remotely by, for example, a web page with an include/iframe using
an overlong URL.

 I would advise anyone currently using dsocks to click here:

and if they crash their dsocks-enabled web-browser, to stop using it very
quickly indeed.
