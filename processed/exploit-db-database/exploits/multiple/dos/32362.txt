Unreal Engine is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because of an error in memory allocation.

An attacker could exploit this issue to crash applications that use the vulnerable engine and deny service to legitimate users.

This issue affects Unreal Engine 3; other versions may also be affected.
