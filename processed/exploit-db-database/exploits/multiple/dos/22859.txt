Axis Print Server web interface could expose the device to a denial of service vulnerability.

It has been reported that an attacker may make a malicious HTTP request that will trigger an exception in the affected server, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

It is not known if the denial of service is limited to the web interface or the entire appliance.

It should be noted that while this vulnerability has been reported to affect the web interface of Axis Print Server 560 and 5600 running firmware versions 6.10, 6.15 and 6.20, other versions might also be affected.
