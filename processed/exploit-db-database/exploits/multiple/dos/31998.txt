S.T.A.L.K.E.R is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities:

- A stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability
- An integer-overflow vulnerability
- A denial-of-service vulnerability

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application or crash the application, denying service to legitimate users.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl 1.0006 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
