Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter (GRAW) is prone to an integer-overflow vulnerability and an array-indexing-overflow vulnerability.

Successful exploits may allow attackers to cause denial-of-service conditions. Due to the nature of these issues, code-execution may also be possible, but this has not been confirmed.

GRAW 1.35 and GRAW 2 1.05 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
