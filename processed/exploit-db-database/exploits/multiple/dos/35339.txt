  JourneyMap (http://journeymap.techbrew.net/) is a mapping mod for
Minecraft.  It comes included with some modpacks, and is enabled by
default in the popular Feed the Beast client.  JourneyMap opens a web
server on the client which is configured to listen on port 8080.  When
the client is running, a remote, unauthenticated user can have
JourneyMap save a screenshot of the game to the hard drive by accessing
a specific URL, consuming hard drive space.  Here's an example:

#!/bin/bash
   while true;
     do
     curl -o /dev/null 192.168.1.1:8080/action?type=savemap&mapType=day
   done

   This works even when the client has paused the game (by pressing
escape.)  We include mapType=day because the software should refuse to
save a screenshot if the client user is underground, and the game is set
on hardcore mode.

   Accessing the URL and triggering a screenshot will display a message
on the client's screen, which may somewhat lessen the severity of this
exploit.  Further, it takes a long time to fill up disk using this
technique.  JourneyMap allows depth and resolution to be specified in
the URL as well, though a few simple tests showed no change despite
altering these parameters.  If one were able to increase the depth and
resolution of the image, the drive would fill up faster.

   Tested with JourneyMap 5.0.0RC2 Ultimate Edition, but presumed to
work on other versions as well.
