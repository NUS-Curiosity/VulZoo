Softalk Mail Server is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users.
Given the nature of this issue, attackers may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

Softalk Mail Server 8.5.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
