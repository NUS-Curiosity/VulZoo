RemotelyAnywhere is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue will cause the server to copy data to a NULL pointer, which will crash the server, denying access to legitimate users.

This issue affects RemotelyAnywhere Server and Workstation 8.0.688; other versions may also be affected.
