Multiple remote vulnerabilities have been reported to affect Quake II. These issues are due to boundary condition checking failures, access validation failures and failures to handle exceptional conditions.

An attacker may leverage these issues to trigger a denial of service condition, execute arbitrary code, gain access to sensitive server files and rejoin a server that they have been banned from.
