This issue was uncovered with AFL (http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/)

The attached sample evokes a divide-by-zero error in the dissect_pbb_tlvblock() function at packet-packetbb.c:289.

The variable of interest seems to be 'c' which is set at packet-packetbb.c:285 using two other variables and an addition. When c is zero, the expression "length/c" at packet-packetbb.c:289 results in a divide-by-zero error.

Divide-by-zero has been observed when sample is parsed by tshark versions 1.12.8, 1.12.9, 1.12.10, 1.12.12, and 2.0.4 among others.
