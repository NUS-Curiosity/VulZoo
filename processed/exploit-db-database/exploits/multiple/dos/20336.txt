Unify eWave ServletExec is a Java/Java Servlet engine plug-in for major web servers such as Microsoft IIS, Apache, Netscape Enterprise Server, etc.

eWave ServletExec is susceptible to a denial of service attack if a URL invoking the ServletExec servlet preceded by /servlet is requested. The ServletExec engine will attempt to bind a server thread over port 80 and if the web server is currently running, a java.net.BindException error will result thus halting all operations on the ServletExec engine. The web server is not affected by this vulnerability. Restarting the application is required in order to regain normal functionality.
