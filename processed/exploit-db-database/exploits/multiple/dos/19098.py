# Apple iTunes 10.6.1.7 M3U Playlist File Walking Heap Buffer Overflow
#
#
# Vendor: Apple Inc.
# Product web page: http://www.apple.com
# Affected version: 10.6.1.7 and 10.6.0.40
#
# Summary: iTunes is a free application for your Mac or PC. It lets you
# organize and play digital music and video on your computer. It can
# automatically download new music, app, and book purchases across all
# your devices and computers. And itÂ’s a store that has everything you
# need to be entertained. Anywhere. Anytime.
#
# Desc: The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the processing
# of a playlist file, which can be exploited to cause a heap based buffer
# overflow when a user opens e.g. a specially crafted .M3U file. Successful
# exploitation could allow execution of arbitrary code on the affected node.
