Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey are prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability.

Successful exploits may allow an attacker to crash the affected browser, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. Given the nature of this issue, memory corruption or code execution might be possible, but has not been confirmed.

The issue affects Firefox 3.6.7 and SeaMonkey 2.0.1; other versions may also be affected.
