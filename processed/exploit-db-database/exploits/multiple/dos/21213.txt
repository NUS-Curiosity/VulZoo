Snort is a network intrusion detection system (IDS). It is originally written for Linux and Unix systems, although it has also been ported to run under Microsoft Windows. Snort is capable of flexible and powerful content analysis of network traffic, and can detect a large number of attack attempts.

An error exists in some versions of Snort. If a maliciously constructed ICMP packet is received, the daemon will crash. This is caused because Snort erroneously defines the minimum ICMP header size as 8 bytes. A restart will be required to regain normally functionality.
