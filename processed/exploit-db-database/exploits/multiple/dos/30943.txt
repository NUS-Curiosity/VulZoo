Libnemesi is prone to multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code in the context of applications that use the library. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Libnemesi 0.6.4-rc1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
