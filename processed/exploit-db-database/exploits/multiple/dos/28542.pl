Verso NetPerformer Frame Relay Access Device (FRAD) is prone to a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the telnet service.

A remote attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code on the affected device. Failed exploit attempts will likely crash the device, denying service to legitimate users.
