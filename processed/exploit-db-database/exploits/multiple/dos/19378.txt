The IMail ldap service has an unchecked buffer, resulting in a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. While it does not crash the service, it drives CPU utilization up rendering the system essentially unusable.

Telnet to target machine, port 389
Send: Y glob1
hit enter twice
Server Returns: 0
Send: Y glob2
hit enter

Where glob1 and glob2 are 2375 characters and Y is Y. The ldap service goes to 90 percent or so and idles there. Therefore using up most system resources.
