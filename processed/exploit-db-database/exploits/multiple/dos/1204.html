Mozilla Firefox <= 1.0.6 (Host:) Buffer Overflow DoS String
Formatted for your tesing /str0ke

Versions Affected:
Firefox Win32 1.0.6 and prior
Firefox Linux 1.0.6 and prior
Firefox 1.5 Beta 1 (Deer Park Alpha 2)

Technical Details:
The problem seems to be when a hostname which has all dashes causes the
NormalizeIDN call in nsStandardURL::BuildNormalizedSpec to return true,
but is sets encHost to an empty string.  Meaning, Firefox appends 0 to
approxLen and then appends the long string of dashes to the buffer
instead.  The following HTML code below will reproduce this issue:

String:
<A HREF=https:--------------------------------------------- >
