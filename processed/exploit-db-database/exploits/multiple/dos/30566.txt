Alien Arena 2007 is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities, including a denial-of-service vulnerability and a format-string vulnerability.

Successfully exploiting these issues will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application or to disconnect users from the game server.
