Vuln Classes:   stack buffer overwrite (CWE-121)
Origin:         remote
Min. Privs.:    post auth
CVE:            CVE-2016-2563

Summary

The putty SCP command-line utility (pscp) is missing a bounds-check for a stack buffer when processing the SCP-SINK file-size response to a SCP download request. This may allow a malicious server to overwrite the stack buffer within the client- application potentially leading to remote code execution.

PoC attached. patch attached.

Besides that, two minor issues have been reported in putty packet handling:

DoS condition in the parsing of SSH-Strings that lead to a nullptr read. (connect putty to poc.py and type x11exploit to trigger one of multiple occurrence of a crash, also works with x11forwarding disabled in putty)
DoS condition in the handling of unrequested forwarded-tcpip channels open requests that lead to a nullptr read. (connect putty to poc.py and type forwardedtcpipcrash to trigger crash)

Details

The vulnerable code is located in pscp.c [4] line 1498 (HEAD) and is based on an unbound sscanf string format descriptor storing an arbitrary length string in a 40byte fixed size stack buffer sizestr[40].
