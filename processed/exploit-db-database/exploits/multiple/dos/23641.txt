Chaser has been reported to be prone to a denial of service vulnerability. This issue is caused by a lack of input validation of a size parameter specified in UDP network communication packets. The process will attempt to read the amount of data specified by the packet, without regard to the amount of memory allocated. This will cause an attempt by the application to dereference unallocated memory, producing an exception and causing the process to crash.
