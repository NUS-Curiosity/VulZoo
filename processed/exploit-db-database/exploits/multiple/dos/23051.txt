WapServ has been reported prone to multiple remote denial of service vulnerabilities.

The issues present themselves when malicious data is received and processed over ports 9200 and 9201.

A remote attacker may exploit these conditions to trigger a denial of service of the WapServ server.

To Crash Wap Serv:
Send the following data over the specific listening ports:
a) 0x00 (or any single byte value) to port 9200 (Connection-less non WTLS)
or
b) 0x89, 0x77, 0x13, 0x86, 0x3d to port 9201 (Connection-orientated non WTLS)

To Cause Out Of Memory
Send the following over the specified listening ports:
a) 0xa6, 0x09, 0x5d to port 9201 (Connection-orientated non WTLS)
