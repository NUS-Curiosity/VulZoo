A denial-of-service vulnerability has been reported to affect several browsers. The vulnerability occurs when executing certain malformed JavaScript-enabled pages.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious JavaScript page that makes a call to certain methods. When an affected browser is used to view the malformed page, the Java Virtual Machine will crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

<script language="Javascript">
t = new Packages.sun.plugin.javascript.navig5.JSObject(1,1);
</script>
