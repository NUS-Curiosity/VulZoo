The DiGi WWW Server has been reported to contain a remote denial of service vulnerability. It has been reported that when the server receives a malformed HTTP GET request, the web server process will consume large amounts of CPU resources.

Since this is a web server application, this leads to a remotely exploitable denial of service vulnerability.

GET ///[660Kb of /]/// HTTP/1.1

to a vulnerable server would demonstrate the effect.
