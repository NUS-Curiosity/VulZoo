JanaServer 2 is a commercially available proxy server designed for the Microsoft Windows platform. It contains support for services such as HTTP, FTP, email, and RealPlayer streaming.

Multiple remote denial of service vulnerabilities affect JanaServer 2. These issues are due to a failure of the application to handle malformed network communications.

The first issue presents itself when malformed HTTP requests are made to the affected application. The second issue presents itself when the application attempts to process malformed RealPlayer streaming data.

An attacker may leverage these issues to cause the affected proxy server to hang, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
