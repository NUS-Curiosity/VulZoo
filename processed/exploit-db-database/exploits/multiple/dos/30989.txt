Pragma Systems FortressSSH is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to adequately handle certain exceptions when processing overly long user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit this issue to exhaust the maximum number of connections alotted for servers. Successful attacks will deny access to legitimate users.

FortressSSH 5.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
