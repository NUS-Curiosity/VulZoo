DConnect Daemon is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

This issue occurs because the application fails to handle null-pointer exceptions properly.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the server, causing a denial-of-service.

Version 0.7.0, CVS July 30th 2006 and prior versions are vulnerable to this issue.
