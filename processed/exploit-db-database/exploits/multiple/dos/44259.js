PoC:

    let tmp = opt.x;  // LdaNamedProperty
    for (;;) {
        arg;

What happened:
1. The LdaNamedProperty operation "opt.x" was lowered to a graph exit in the graph builder. This set the current environment to nullptr (BytecodeGraphBuilder::ApplyEarlyReduction).
2. The environment for the next block (for-loop) was supposed to be created from merging with the previous environment, but it had been set to nullptr at 1. So the context value remained as "undefined".
3. But GetSpecializationContext directly casted the context value to Context* which resulted in type confusion.
