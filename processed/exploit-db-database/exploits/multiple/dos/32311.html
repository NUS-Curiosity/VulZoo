Google Chrome is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to handle user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit this issue to make the application unresponsive, denying service to legitimate users.

Google Chrome 0.2.149.27 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

NOTE: Reports indicate that this issue may not be exploitable as described and may depend on a particular WebKit configuration.
