Wireshark is prone to multiple vulnerabilities, including an information-disclosure issue and denial-of-service issues.

Exploiting these issues may allow attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information, cause crashes, and deny service to legitimate users of the application. Attackers may be able to leverage some of these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

These issues affect Wireshark 0.9.5 up to and including 1.0.0.
