Oracle 10g is reportedly prone to a integer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to allocate a large enough data type to accommodate user-supplied input before using it in a query. This issue has not been confirmed.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application. Failed exploit attempts will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

Reports indicate that Oracle 10g R2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
