Anon Proxy Server is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently bounds-check user-supplied input.

Successful exploits allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application, facilitating the compromise of affected computers.

Versions prior to Anon Proxy Server 0.103 are vulnerable to this issue.
