Due to a faulty mechanism in the password parsing implementation in authentication requests, it is possible to launch a denial of service attack against Allaire ColdFusion 4.5.1 or previous by inputting a string of over 40 000 characters to the password field in the Administrator login page. CPU utilization could reach up to 100%, bringing the program to halt. The default form for the login page would prevent such an attack. However, a malicious user could download the form locally to their hard drive, modify HTML tag fields, and be able to submit the 40 000 character string to the ColdFusion Server.

Restarting the application would be required in order to regain normal functionality.


The Administrator login page can be typically accessed via:
http://target/cfide/administrator/index.cfm

Modify the field size and POST action in the HTML tags to allow for the input of a character string consisting of over 40 000 characters.
