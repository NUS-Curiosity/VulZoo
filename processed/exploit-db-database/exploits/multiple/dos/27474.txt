LibVC is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the library to perform proper bounds checks on user-supplied data before using it in a finite-sized buffer.

The issue occurs when the application handles excessive data supplied with a vcard file.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the affected library, effectively denying service. Arbitrary code execution is also possible, which may facilitate a compromise of the underlying system.

The following proof of concept is available:

BEGIN:VCARD
VERSION:3.0

N:;
END:VCARD
