VLC Media Player is prone to a memory-corruption vulnerability.

Attackers can exploit this issue to cause a denial-of-service condition. Due to the nature of this issue, arbitrary code execution may be possible but this has not been confirmed.

VLC Media Player 2.1.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
