Easy File Sharing Web Server is prone to a directory-traversal and multiple information-disclosure vulnerabilities.

Successfully exploiting these issues allows remote attackers to upload files to arbitrary locations and to access potentially sensitive information, which may aid in further attacks.

Easy File Sharing Web Server 4.5 is vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.
