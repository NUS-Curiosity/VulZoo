Dawn of Time MUD server is prone to multiple format-string vulnerabilities.

Exploiting these issues will allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of a user running the application. Failed attacks will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

These issues affect Dawn of Time 1.69s beta4 and 1.69r; other versions may also be affected.
