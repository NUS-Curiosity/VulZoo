Dual DHCP DNS Server is prone to a remote buffer overflow vulnerability.

The vulnerability presents itself when the server handles excessive data through the DHCP options field.

Successful exploitation can allow attackers to trigger a denial of service condition or execute arbitrary code to gain unauthorized remote access in the context of the affected server.

Dual DHCP DNS Server 1.0 is reported to be affected.
