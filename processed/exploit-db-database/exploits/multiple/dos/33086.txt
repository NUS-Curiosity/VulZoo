America's Army is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to properly handle invalid queries.

Exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to cause the application to crash, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

America's Army 3.0.4 and prior versions are vulnerable.
