Oracle Internet Directory is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability.

Exploits may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

Oracle Internet Directory 10.1.2.0.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

NOTE: This issue may be a duplicate of an existing BID and may have already been addressed by the vendor. We will update the BID if more information emerges.
