Mozilla Firefox is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability when running certain JavaScript commands on empty applets in an iframe.

Successful exploits can allow attackers to crash the affected browser, resulting in denial-of-service conditions. Given the nature of this issue, attackers may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

This issue affects Firefox 2.0.0.14; other versions may also be vulnerable.
