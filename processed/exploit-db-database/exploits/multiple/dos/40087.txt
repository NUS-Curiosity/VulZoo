The attached ATF file causes a heap overflow in ATF processing. To reproduce this issue, put LoadImage.swf and test.png on a remote server, and visit http://127.0.0.1/LoadImage.swf?img=test.png.

To differentiate this from other ATF issues, this is an overflow in decompressing alphas when an image has a height of 1 pixel.
