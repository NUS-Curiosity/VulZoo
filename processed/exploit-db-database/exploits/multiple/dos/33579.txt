Ingres Database is prone to a heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application or crash the affected application.

Ingres Database 9.3 on Unix is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
