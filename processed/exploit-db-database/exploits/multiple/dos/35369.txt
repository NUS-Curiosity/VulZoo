Battlefield 2 and 2142 are prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability due to a NULL-pointer dereference condition.

An attacker may exploit this issue to crash the application, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

Battlefield 2 version 1.50 and Battlefield 2142 version 1.51 are vulnerable. Other versions may also be affected.
