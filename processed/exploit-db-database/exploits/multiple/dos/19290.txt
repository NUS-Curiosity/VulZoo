Vendor description:
-------------------

Airlock is a Web application firewall (WAF) that offers a combination of
defence mechanisms for Web applications. It has been developed to meet the
security standards criteria of the payment card industry (PCI DSS), online
banking security and the protection of e-commerce, and provides sustainable,
easy to administrate and audit security for Web applications.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------

The Airlock WAF protection can be completely bypassed by using overlong UTF-8
character representations of the NUL character such as C0 80, E0 80 80 and F0
80 80 80. During the tests no internal knowledge of the WAF was known, but it
is suspected that the UTF-8 decoder fails to reject the overlong NUL byte
character representations and they get decoded as U+0000 later on. Further the
WAF would not perform any checks for attack patterns after the NUL byte.

Proof of concept:
-----------------

The WAF blocks requests based on patterns that it recognizes as a web
application attack, for instance:

allowed:
http://www.abc.com/file.ext?id=101'+union+select

forbidden:
http://www.abc.com/file.ext?id=101'+union+select+1+from+Dual+--+

If an overlong UTF-8 character representation of the NUL byte forgoes any web
application attack sequence, the WAF would fail to recognize the attack
pattern, for instance:

forbidden:
http://www.abc.com/file.ext?id=101'+union+select+col1,col2,col3+from+tab
le+--+

allowed:
http://www.abc.com/file.ext?id=101%C0%80'+union+select+col1,col2,col3+fr
om+table+--+
