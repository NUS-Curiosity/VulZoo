SUPERAntiSpyware and Super Ad Blocker are prone to multiple local vulnerabilities, including:

- Multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities
- Multiple local privilege-escalation vulnerabilities
- A security vulnerability that may allow attackers to read and write arbitrary files
- An information-disclosure vulnerability

An attacker can exploit these issues to gain elevated privileges on the affected computer, crash the affected computer, gain access to sensitive information, or overwrite arbitrary files. Other attacks are also possible.
