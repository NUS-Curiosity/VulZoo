Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following products are known to be affected by this vulnerability:

* GIMP <= 2.8.0 (Windows or Linux builds)

Products Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------
* GIMP 2.8.1

Details
=======

There is a file handling DoS in GIMP (the GNU Image Manipulation Program) for
the 'fit' file format affecting all versions (Windows and Linux) up to 2.8.0.
A file in the fit format with a malformed 'XTENSION' header will cause a crash
in the GIMP program. The flaw is triggered by opening a crafted 'fit' file or
allowing the file explorer dialog to preview the file.

A file in the fit format starting as follows will trigger the crash:
XTENSIONaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaHEADER2...

The vulnerable code is in the fits-io.c lines where the program attempts to
copy from a null pointer:

{
fdat = fits_decode_card (fits_search_card (hdr, "XTENSION"), typ_fstring);
strcpy (hdulist->xtension, fdat->fstring);
}

This code can be patched by changing it to the following (as GIMP 2.8.1):

fdat = fits_decode_card (fits_search_card (hdr, "XTENSION"), typ_fstring);
if(fdat != NULL) {
strcpy (hdulist->xtension, fdat->fstring);
} else {
strcpy (errmsg, "No valid XTENSION header found.");
goto err_return;
}

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in an application
crash and denial of service.

Solution
===========
The GIMP team have provided an update for this issue (release 2.8.1).

Workarounds
===========

The fits-io.c file can be patched as above.
