A set of vulnerabilities in the counter.exe web hit counter program enables denial of service attacks.

A malicious user can create a malformed like ",1" entry in the counter.log file by requesting a URL of the form "http://www.example.com/scripts/counter.exe?%0A". Any further attempt for request will result in an Access Violation in counter.exe.

A similar vulnerability exists if a user requests a URL of the form "http://www.example.com/scripts/counter.exe?AAAAA" with over 2200 A's.

All further requests for counter.exe are queued and are not processed until the error messages are cleared at the console. System memory may be decremented each time a request for counter.exe is queued.
