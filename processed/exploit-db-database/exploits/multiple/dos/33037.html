Apple QuickTime is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

Note that an attacker will exploit this issue through the Safari browser by enticing a user to visit a malicious site. This will crash the user's browser.

Successful exploits may allow the attacker to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users. Given the nature of this issue, the attacker may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.
