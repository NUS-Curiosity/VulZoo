Summary and Impact
==================
A heap-based buffer overflow has been identified in the Thunderbird email
client. The issue is present in the libical implementation, which was forked
from upstream libical version 0.47.
The issue can be triggered remotely, when an attacker sends an specially
crafted calendar attachment and does not require user interaction. It
might be used by a remote attacker to crash or gain remote code execution
in the client system.
This issue was initially reported by Brandon Perry here:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1281041
and fixed in libical upstream, but was never fixed in Thunderbird.
X41 did not perform a full test or audit on the software.

Product Description
===================
Thunderbird is a free and open source email, newsfeed, chat, and calendaring
client, that's easy to set up and customize.

Analysis
========
A heap-based buffer overflow in icalparser.c parser_get_next_char()
can be triggered while parsing a calendar attachment containing a malformed
or specially crafted string.
The issue initially manifests with out of bounds read, but we don't discard
it could later lead to out of bounds write.
It is expected that an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve
remote code execution.

Proof of Concept
================
A reproducer ical file can be found in https://github.com/x41sec/advisories/tree/master/X41-2019-002

Workarounds
===========
A fix is available from upstream. Alternatively, libical can be replaced by icaljs,
a JavaScript implementation of ical parsing, by setting
calendar.icaljs = true in Thunderbird configuration.
