Product Overview:

http://www.resiprocate.org/

reSIProcate is a SIP stack.  SIP is a protocol used for voice-over-IP
telephony. repro is a SIP proxy/registrar that uses the reSIProcate SIP stack.


Vulnerability Details:

A malformed INVITE or OPTIONS message to the repro SIP proxy/registrar can
crash the process. The crash is caused by an assertion failure that occurs
when the domain name in the request line URI is too long
(rutil/dns/DnsStub.cxx, line 493). For example, the URI may be
"sip:bob@example.comAAAAAAA...", where "sip:bob@example.com" is followed by
256 As. To cause the crash, the address in the To header must be a valid
target address.

Example invalid packet:
  OPTIONS sip:bob@example.comAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SIP/2.0
