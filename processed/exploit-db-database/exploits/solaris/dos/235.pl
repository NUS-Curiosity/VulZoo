# The problem is catman creates files in /tmp
# insecurly. They are based on the PID of the
# catman process, catman will happily clobber
# any files that  are symlinked to that file.
# The idea of this  script  is  to  watch the
# process  list  for  the catman process, get
# the pid and Create a symlink in /tmp to our
# file to be clobbered.  This exploit depends
# on  system  speed  and  process  load. This
# worked on a patched Solaris 2.7 box (August
# 2000 patch cluster)
# SunOS rootabega 5.7 Generic_106541-12 sun4u
# sparc SUNW,Ultra-1 lwc@vapid.betteros.org
