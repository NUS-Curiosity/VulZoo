A vulnerability in Solaris TCP/IP stack may allow remote users to panic the system.

If the nmap network mapping utility is used with the OS fingerprinting option ('-O') against an active listening port and the server listening on that port is then killed the system will panic because of recursive calls to mutex_enter within the TCP streams driver.
