Sun Solaris 10 is prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability. This issue affects the UFS filesystem-handling code.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the affected computer, denying service to legitimate users.

Solaris 10 on the ia32/x86 architecture has been reported vulnerable; previous versions may be affected as well, but Symantec has not confirmed this.
