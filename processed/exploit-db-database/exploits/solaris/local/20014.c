Solaris is a version of the UNIX Operating System distributed by Sun Microsystems.

Solaris ships with a filesystem utility called ufsrestore that is used for archive/backup retrieval. A problem with the utility could allow a local user to gain elevated privileges.

The ufsrestore utility is setuid root by default, and vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. The problem is an oversight in code that was put in place to try and correct/prevent this very type of vulnerability. In a function in ufsrestore, two strncat calls (libc functions that are used to concatenate two NULL terminated arrays) are used to construct a string. The programmer made an effort to prevent a buffer overflow by using the strncat functions, which allow you to specify a maximum byte length. The error is that an incorrect number of bytes are passed to the strncat calls as length. The number of bytes (the maximum that the function should copy) that are passed to the strncats are the size of the entire buffer (the one being constructed), meaning it is possible to overflow it via strncat.

This problem makes it possible for a local user execute arbitrary code, and gain root priviliges.

/*
 * ufsroot.c
 * Job de Haas
 * (c) ITSX bv 2000
 *
 * This program demonstrates an overflow problem in /usr/lib/fs/ufs/ufsrestore.
 * The exploit requires a file called 'dumpufs' created with the accompanying
 * 'ufsscript' in the directory /var/tmp. When successful it will execture the
 * command '/bin/touch /tmp/root_was_here'. This demonstration has only been
 * tested on sun4u Solaris 8.
 *
 * The problem is a programming error trying to fix an overflow bug.
 * The relevant code probably looks something like:
 *
 *      char output[BUFSIZ];
 *      ....
 *              (void) strncpy(output, curdir, BUFSIZ);
 *              (void) strncat(output, "/", BUFSIZ);
 *              (void) strncat(output, rawname, BUFSIZ);
 *              canon(output, name, size);
 *
 * This assumption is based on original restore source code as can been seen in
 * http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/src/sbin/restore/interactive.c?rev=1.5
 * and dissassembly of the relevant portion of /usr/lib/fs/ufs/ufsrestore.
 *
 * I toyed a bit with some code to position the shellcode at a well defined
 * location, independent of the platform at run time. It does not work very
 * well yet. No 64 bit detection yet and often exploits still need some tuning
 * of frame pointers or registers anyway.
 *
 * cc ufsroot.c -o ufsroot
