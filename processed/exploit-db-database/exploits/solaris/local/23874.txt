It has been reported that Sun Solaris may be prone to a local privilege escalation vulnerability that may allow an attacker to gain root access to a vulnerable system. The issue exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data via the vfs_getvfssw() function in the Solaris kernel. An attacker can load a user-specified kernel module by using directory traversal sequences and employing the mount() or sysfs() system calls.
