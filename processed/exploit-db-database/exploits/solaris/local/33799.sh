Sun Connection Update Manager for Solaris creates temporary files in an insecure manner.

An attacker with local access could potentially exploit these issues to perform symbolic-link attacks, overwriting arbitrary files in the context of the affected application.

Successfully mounting a symlink attack may allow the attacker to overwrite or corrupt sensitive files, which may result in a denial-of-service or privilege escalation. Other attacks may also be possible.

These issues affect unknown versions of the application. In addition, these issues may affect certain Solaris patch clusters or individual patch releases.
