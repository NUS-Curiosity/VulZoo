Apache Tomahawk MyFaces JSF Framework is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this vulnerability may allow an attacker to launch cross-site scripting attacks on unsuspecting users in the context of the affected website. As a result, the attacker may be able to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.
