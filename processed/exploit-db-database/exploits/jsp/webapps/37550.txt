DataWatch Monarch Business Intelligence is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities.

Successful exploits will allow an attacker to manipulate the XPath query logic to carry out unauthorized actions on the XML documents of the application. It will also allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.

DataWatch Monarch Business Intelligence 5.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
