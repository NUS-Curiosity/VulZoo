Desc: File path manipulation vulnerabilities arise when user-controllable data
is placed into a file or URL path that is used on the server to access
local resources, which may be within or outside the web root. An attacker can
modify the file path to access different resources, which may contain sensitive
information. Even where an attack is constrained within the web root, it is often
possible to retrieve items that are normally protected from direct access, such
as application configuration files, the source code for server-executable scripts,
or files with extensions that the web server is not configured to serve directly.
