Cyclades AlterPath Manager is a network device designed to facilitate remote administration of all network-accessible infrastructure resources.

Multiple remote vulnerabilities affect Cyclades AlterPath Manager. These issues are due to various design errors that affect the overall security of the vulnerable device.

The first issue is an information disclosure issue. The second would allow unauthorized access to restricted console resources. Finally the third issue will facilitate privilege escalation.

An attacker may leverage these issues to gain unauthorized access to network-based resources, to gain escalated privileges and to gain access to potentially sensitive information.

It should be noted that although only version 1.1.0 of the software is reported affected by these issues, it is likely earlier versions are affected as well.

To access a restricted console resource:
