This vulnerability is present in ZENworks Configuration Management
(ZCM) which is part of the ZENworks Suite.
A blast from the past? This is a similar vulnerability to ZDI-10-078 /
OSVDB-63412, but it abuses a different parameter of the same servlet.
However this time Novell:
- Did not bother issuing a security advisory to their customers.
- Did not credit me even though I did responsible disclosure.
- Refused to provide a CVE number for months.
- Did not update their ZENworks Suite Trial software with the fix (you
can download it now from their site, install and test the PoC /
Metasploit module).
- Does not list the fix in the ZCM 11.3.2 update information
(https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7015776).


>> Technical details:
Vulnerability: Remote code execution via file upload and directory traversal
CVE-2015-0779
Constraints: none; no authentication or any other information needed
Affected versions: ZENworks Configuration Management 11.3.1 and below

POST /zenworks/UploadServlet?uid=../../../opt/novell/zenworks/share/tomcat/webapps/&filename=payload.war
<WAR file payload in the body>

The WAR file will be automatically deployed to the server (on certain
Windows and Linux installations the path can be "../webapps/"). A
Metasploit module that exploits this vulnerability has been released.


>> Fix:
Upgrade to version ZENworks Configuration Management 11.3.2.
