Arbitrary file upload / remote code execution in ManageEngine Desktop Central / Desktop Central MSP
Discovered by Pedro Ribeiro (pedrib@gmail.com), Agile Information Security
=================================================================================

Background on the affected product:
"Desktop Central is an integrated desktop & mobile device management
software that helps in managing the servers, laptops, desktops,
smartphones and tablets from a central point. It automates your
regular desktop management routines like installing patches,
distributing software, managing your IT Assets, managing software
licenses, monitoring software usage statistics, managing USB device
usage, taking control of remote desktops, and more."

There are several vulnerable servers are out there if you know the
Google dorks. Quoting the author of the Internet Census 2012: "As a
rule of thumb, if you believe that "nobody would connect that to the
Internet, really nobody", there are at least 1000 people who did."
These vulnerabilities can be abused to achieve remote code execution
as SYSTEM in Windows. I've updated the desktopcentral_file_upload
Metasploit module to use the new statusUpdate technique. Needless to
say, owning a Desktop Central box will give you control of all the
computers and smartphones it manages.

incomplete and it is still possible to upload a shell with a valid
computerName, domainName and customerId.
