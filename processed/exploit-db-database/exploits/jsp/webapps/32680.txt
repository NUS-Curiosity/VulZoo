Openfire is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting the issue may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

Openfire 3.6.2 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
