Affected Product(s):
====================
DELL SonicWall
Product: GMS Networks Appliance Application 7.1


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the official DELL SonicWall GMS v7.1.x Appliance Web-Application.
The bug allows an attacker (remote) to implement/inject own malicious malicious script codes on the application-side (persistent).

The persistent vulnerability is located in the `valfield_1` & `value_1` value parameters of the `Alert Settings` module POST method request.
Remote attackers with low privileged application user account can inject own script codes to the POST method request of the createNewThreshold.jsp
appliance application file. After the inject the attacker is able to update and save the values to continue with the execute the main alert
settings module. The execute of the script code occurs in the ematStaticAlertTypes.jsp file context by the earlier manipulated vulnerable values.

To bypass the filter it is required to split the request by attaching a double frame for the script code execute. The restricted application itself
disallows the POST request of guest by usage of the unrestricted context POST method request attackers are able to bypass the filter & exception-handling.

The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as high(-) with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system)
count of 4.1(+). The coordinated disclosure procedure of the remote vulnerability has been navigated by the product manager Wilson Lee (DELL).
The hotfix and information has been provided in cooperation with the vulnerability-laboratory.

Exploitation of the persistent web vulnerability requires low user interaction and a local low privileged (guest) web application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (customers), account steal via persistent web attacks,
persistent phishing or persistent manipulation of vulnerable module context.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] DELL - SonicWall GMS v7.1.x Appliance Application

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Alert Settings > NewThreshold

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] createNewThreshold.jsp > ematStaticAlertTypes.jsp

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] valfield_1
				[+] value_1

Affected Module(s):
				[+] createNewThreshold
				[+] ematStaticAlertTypes
				[+] Alert Settings - Main Listing

Affected Product(s):
				[+] Dell SonicWALL GMS
				[+] Dell SonicWALL Analyzer
				[+] Dell SonicWALL UMA E5000


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged or restricted guest accounts and
low user interaction. For security demonstration or reproduce the vulnerability follow the information and steps below.


Location: Alert Settings
http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/panelManager?panelidz=1&level=1&typeOfUnits=0#

Inject via Add: Edit contents for alert type: Backed-Up Syslog Files
http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/ematStaticAlertTypes.jsp?

Execute: Create New Threshold
http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/createNewThreshold.jsp?

Affected:
http://gms.localhost:8080/sgms/auth



Manual steps to reproduce ...

1.  Open the Sonicwall GMS appliance application and login with full restrictions as guest
2.  Switch to the vulnerable Console > Events > Alert Settings section
3.  Click Add Alert and a new blank window of the application will be opened
4.  Click in the upcomings window in the Alert Types section the Edit Content link
5.  Now, a new window opens "Edit contents for alert type: Backup Sys-Log Files
6.  On top is a little plus button next to the Threshold value
9.  A new window opens with Elements box ... Inject your payload (script code) to the description eval in the operator fields
10. After the inject to the input fields the attacker only needs to click the Add Element button on the buttom of the page
11. The code will be directly executed and is persistent saved as element in the specific section
12. Save the input via update and go back to the alert settings main section were the code execute occurs in the same connected value
13. Successful reproduced!

Note: Please, feel free to read also the patch information provided in the solution section of the advisory document.


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse, prevention filter mechanism or clean encode of the vulnerable value_1 and valfield_1 parameters.
Also restrict and escape the affected input field and output listing in the connected modules.

Resolution (DELL SonicWall):
We recommend existing users of Dell SonicWALL GMS/Analyzer/UMA 7.1 to apply SP1 (if they have not already done so), and then apply Hotfix 134235 to prevent cross-site scripting by unauthorized users. 7.1 SP1 and the Hotfix are available for download from www.mysonicwall.com. Users should log into mySonicWALL and click on Downloads > Download Center in the navigation panel on the left, then select “GMS/Analyzer” in the Software Type drop down menu.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability with filter bypass is estimated as medium(+).
