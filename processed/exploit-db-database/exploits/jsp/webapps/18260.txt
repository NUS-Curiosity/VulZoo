Abstract:
=========
Vulnerability-lab Team discovered multiple Web  Vulnerabilities on Barracuda Control Center 620 appliance/application.

Affected Products:
==================

Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
1.1
Multiple persistent Input Validation vulnerabilities are detected on Barracudas Control Center 620. Local low privileged user account can
implement/inject malicious persistent script code. When exploited by an authenticated user, the identified vulnerabilities
can lead to information disclosure, access to intranet available servers, manipulated persistent content.

Vulnerable Module(s): (Persistent)
										[+] authdblookup -input

1.2
Multiple non-persistent Input Validation vulnerabilities are detected on Barracudas Control Center 620 appliance.
Attackers can form malicious client-side requests to hijack customer/admin sessions.
Successful exploitation requires user inter action & can lead to information disclosure, session
hijacking and access to servers in the intranet.

Vulnerable Module(s): (Non-Persistent)
										[+] editdevices
										[+] main

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerabilities can be exploited by low privileged user accounts or remote attacker via high required user inter action.
For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.1 Persistent
https://127.0.0.1:8080/bcc/authdblookup-input.jsp?selected-user=guest@barracuda.com&selected-node=

Manually reproduce ...
1. Login
2. Switch to the vulnerable authdblookup-input.jsp  add mask
3. Include your own malicious persistent script code (java-script or html) & save the input
4. The stored script code will be executed in main-bar as stable output result (persistent)

1.2  Non-Persistent
https://127.0.0.1:8080/bcc/editdevices.jsp?device-type=spyware&selected-node=1&containerid=[IVE]
https://127.0.0.1:8080/bcc/main.jsp?device-type=[IVE]


Solution:
=========
Barracuda implemented after the issues 2011 a validation mask to filter malicious & disallowed inputs.
The barracuda firmware of the filter has been update multiple times.


Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the discovered persistent vulnerabilities are estimated as medium(+) because of low required user inter action.

1.2
The security risk of the discovered non-persistent vulnerabilities are estimated as low because of high required user inter action.
