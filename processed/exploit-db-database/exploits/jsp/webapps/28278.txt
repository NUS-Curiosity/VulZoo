OpenCMS is prone to multiple unauthorized-access vulnerabilities because it fails to properly authenticate users when performing administrative tasks.

An attacker can exploit these issues to view, delete, and modify application data. This could aid in further attacks on the affected computer.

Versions 6.2.1, 6.2, 6.04, and 6.03 are vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
