Oracle Fusion Middleware is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability in BPEL Console.

The vulnerability can be exploited over the 'HTTP' protocol. For an exploit to succeed, the attacker must have 'Valid Session' privileges.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may let the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
Oracle BPEL Console 10.1.3.3.0 is vulnerable.
