Oracle Portal is prone to multiple HTTP response-splitting vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A remote attacker may exploit these vulnerabilities to influence or misrepresent how web content is served, cached, or interpreted. This could aid in various attacks that attempt to entice client users into a false sense of trust.

Versions 10g and 9.0.2 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
