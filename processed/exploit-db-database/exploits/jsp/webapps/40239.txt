[+] ISR: ApparitionSec


Vendor:
=============
www.wso2.com


Product:
============================
Wso2 Identity Server v5.1.0

As the industryâ€™s first enterprise identity bus (EIB), WSO2 Identity Server
is the central backbone
that connects and manages multiple identities across applications, APIs,
the cloud, mobile, and Internet
of Things devices, regardless of the standards on which they are based. The
multi-tenant WSO2 Identity Server
can be deployed directly on servers or in the cloud, and has the ability to
propagate identities across geographical
and enterprise borders in a connected business environment.


Vulnerability Type:
============================
XML External Entity / CSRF


CVE Reference(s):
===================
CVE-2016-4312 (XXE)
CVE-2016-4311 (CSRF)


Vulnerability Details:
=====================


WSO2IS XML parser is vulnerable to XXE attack in the XACML flow, this can
be exploited when XML input containing a reference to an
external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. The attack
leads to the disclosure and exfiltration of confidential
data and arbitrary system files, denial of service, server side request
forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine
where the parser is located (localhost), and other system impacts.

The exploit can be carried out locally by an internal malicious user or
remote via CSRF if an authenticated user clicks an attacker
supplied link or visits a evil webpage. In case of WSO2IS system files can
be read / exfiltrated to the remote attackers server
for safe keeping -_-
