JSPWiki is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including multiple cross-site scripting issues and an HTML-injection issue, because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code will run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Versions prior to JSPWiki 2.5.138-beta are vulnerable.
