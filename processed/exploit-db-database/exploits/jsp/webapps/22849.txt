It has been reported that Verity K2 Toolkit does not sufficiently filter user-supplied search parameters.

As a result of this reported deficiency, it may be possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user, if the link is followed.

This may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.
