DesktopCentral Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability
Affected versions: DesktopCentral versions < 80293

PDF: http://security-assessment.com/files/documents/advisory/DesktopCentral%20Arbitrary%20File%20Upload.pdf

+-----------+
|Description|
+-----------+

ManageEngine DesktopCentral 8.0.0 build 80293 and below suffer from an arbitrary file upload vulnerability that can be
leveraged to gain arbitrary code execution on the server. The code run on the server in this fashion will execute as
NT-AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.
The problem exists in the AgentLogUploadServlet. This servlet takes input from HTTP POST and constructs an output file
on the server without performing any sanitisation or even checking if the caller is authenticated. Due to the way the
path is constructed it is possible to traverse to the application web root and create a script file that will be
executed when called from a web browser.
