Vendor:
============
www.wso2.com


Product:
==================
Ws02Carbon v4.4.5

WSO2 Carbon is the core platform on which WSO2 middleware products are built. It is based on Java OSGi technology, which allows
components to be dynamically installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled, and it eliminates component version conflicts.
In Carbon, this capability translates into a solid core of common middleware enterprise components, including clustering, security,
logging, and monitoring, plus the ability to add components for specific features needed to solve a specific enterprise scenario.


Vulnerability Type:
=================================
Cross Site Request Forgery / DOS


CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2016-4315


Vulnerability Details:
=====================

The getSafeText() Function and conditional logic below processes the "action" parameter with no check for inbound CSRF attacks.

String cookie = (String) session.getAttribute(ServerConstants.ADMIN_SERVICE_COOKIE);
String action = CharacterEncoder.getSafeText(request.getParameter("action"));
ServerAdminClient client = new ServerAdminClient(ctx, backendServerURL, cookie, session);

try {
if ("restart".equals(action)) {
    client.restart();
 } else if ("restartGracefully".equals(action)) {
   client.restartGracefully();
 } else if ("shutdown".equals(action)) {
     client.shutdown();
  } else if ("shutdownGracefully".equals(action)) {
      client.shutdownGracefully();
    }
 } catch (Exception e) {
  response.sendError(500, e.getMessage());
   return;
 }
