Details.
GlassFish is an open source application server project led by Sun
Microsystems for the Java EE platform. The proprietary version is
called Sun GlassFish Enterprise Server. GlassFish supports all Java EE
API specifications, such as JDBC, RMI, e-mail, JMS, web services, XML,
etc, and defines how to coordinate them.

Stored:
The log viewer fails to securely output encode logged values. As a
result, an unauthenticated attacker can trigger the application to log
a malicious string by entering the values into the username field. This
will cause the application to log the incorrect login attempt and
results in a stored XSS vulnerability. When an administrator logs into
the application and views the log, the malicious code will be executed
in the client browser. As an example, navigate to:
http://[host]:4848

Enter the below into the login field:
'>\"><script>alert(3);</script>
When the user views the \"Search Log Files\" page, the above client-side
code will be executed in the client browser. The offending script is
http://[host]:4848/logViewer/logViewer.jsf

Reflected:
By modifying the windowTitle or helpFile variables of
/com_sun_webui_jsf/help/helpwindow.jsf it is possible to trigger a
reflected XSS vulnerability. An example is shown below:
/com_sun_webui_jsf/help/helpwindow.jsf?&windowTitle=Help+Window'>\">
<script>alert(1);</script>&helpFile=commontask.html
/com_sun_webui_jsf/help/helpwindow.jsf?&windowTitle=Help+Window&
helpFile=commontask.html'>\"><script>alert(1);</script>

Solution.
Apply the vendor patch.
