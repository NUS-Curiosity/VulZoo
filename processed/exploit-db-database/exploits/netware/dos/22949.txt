Novell Netware Enterprise Web Server cgi2perl.nlm has been reported prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The issue presents itself, likely due to insufficient bounds checking performed on user-supplied data. It has been reported that a remote attacker may send data in a manner sufficient to trigger the condition, and cause one or more server ABEND conditions.
