It has been reported that dtprintinfo, installed setuid root by default, is susceptible to a locally exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability. The condition is triggered when the value of the DISPLAY environment variable is set to a string exceeding 9777 bytes in length. The vulnerability may allow for local attackers to gain root privileges on the affected host.

export DISPLAY="`perl -e 'printf "A" x 9777'`"
