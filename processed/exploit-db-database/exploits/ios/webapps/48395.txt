Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2020-04-27: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
A directory traversal web vulnerability has been discovered in the Easy
Transfer Wifi Transfer v1.7 ios mobile application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to change the application path
in performed requests to compromise the local application
or file-system of a mobile device. Attackers are for example able to
request environment variables or a sensitive system path.

The directory-traversal web vulnerability is located in the main
application path request performed via GET method. Attackers are
able to request for example the local path variables of the web-server
by changing the local path in the performed request itself.
In a first request the attack changes the path, the host redirects to
complete the adress with "..". Then the attacker just
attaches /.. a final slash to its request and the path can be accessed
via web-browser to download or list local files.

Exploitation of the directory traversal web vulnerability requires no
privileged web-application user account or user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in information
leaking by unauthorized file access and mobile application compromise.


1.2
Multiple persistent cross site scripting vulnerability has been
discovered in the Easy Transfer Wifi Transfer v1.7 ios mobile application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector to compromise the mobile
web-application from the application-side.

The persistent vulnerabilities are located in the `Create Folder` and
`Move/Edit` functions. Attackers are able to inject own malicious
script codes to the `oldPath`, `newPath` and `path` parameters. The
request method to inject is POST and the attack vector is located on
the application-side.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session
hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirects
to malicious source and persistent manipulation of affected application
modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] Create Folder
[+] Move/Edit

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] oldPath
[+] newPath
[+] path


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
1.1
The directory traversal web vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers with wifi network access without user interaction.
