Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local file include web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Privacy Pro v1.2 iOS mobile web-application.
The local file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system
specific path commands to compromise the mobile web-application.

The web vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the `upload` module. Remote attackers are able to inject own files with
malicious `filename` values in the `upload` POST method request to compromise the mobile web-application. The local file/path include
execution occcurs not like regular in the index list but inside of the upload formular message filename context. The attacker is able
to inject the local file include request by usage of the `wifi interface`. The affected service inside of the application is only the
privacy manager `wifi revover data` module. (localhost:56380 -restore)

Remote attackers are also able to exploit the filename validation issue in combination with persistent injected script codes to execute
different local malicious attacks requests. The attack vector is on the application-side of the wifi service and the request method to
inject is POST.

The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system)
count of 6.6. Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction but a privileged web-application
user account with low user auth. Successful exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability results in mobile application or
connected device component compromise.

http://localhost:56380/upload		(Vulnerable File)


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure encode and parse of the upload notification message context and input value.
Restrict the upload input and validate the context next to the data restore.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the local file/path include web vulnerability is estimated as high(-).
