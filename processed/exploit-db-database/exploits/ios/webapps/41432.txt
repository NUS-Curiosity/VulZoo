Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Galaxy Studio (Mo Wellin)
Product: Lock Photos Album & Videos Safe - iOS Mobile (Web-Application) 4.3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A directory traversal vulnerability has been dsicovered in the official Galaxy Studio Lock Photos Album & Videos Safe v4.3 iOS mobile application.
The security vulnerability allows an attackers to unauthorized request and download local application files by usage of manipulated path parameters.

The directory traversal web vulnerability is located in the `PRE` parameter of the wifi web-server interface. Remote attackers are able to request
the local web-server during the sharing process to access unauthenticated application files. Attackers are able to request via form action path
variables to access, download or upload arbitrary files. Remote attackers are able to access the sql-lite database file that own the web-server
access credentials of the application. After the download the attacker is able to access the database management system file to use the credentials
for unauthorized access via protocol. The PRE request with the action form variable allows to inject any path of the local file system without check
for privileges or user access rights. Thus allows an attacker to bypass the local path restriction to compromise the mobile ios web-server application.
The request method to inject is GET and the attack vector is located on the client-side of the web-server web-application. Finally an attacker is able
to access with the credentials the service by using a client via http protocol.

The security risk of the directory traversal vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 7.8.
Exploitation of the web vulnerability requires no privilege web-application user account or user interaction. Successful exploitation of the
vulnerability results in information leaking, mobile application compromise by unauthorized and unauthenticated access.

Request Method(s):
[+] GET

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] PRE

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] form action

Affected Module(s):
[+] Web-Server File System


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The security vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without user interaction or privilege web-application user account.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The security vulnerability can be resolved by disallowing users to access the upper path for root privileges. Ensure that the form
action request denies to access web-server data or application configuration files. Parse and restrict the form action parameter to
prevent further directory traversal attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the directory traversal web vulnerability in the mobile web-server application is estimated as high. (CVSS 7.8)
