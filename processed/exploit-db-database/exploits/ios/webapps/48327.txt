Technical Details & Description:
================================
A directory traversal web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official File Transfer iFamily v2.1 ios mobile application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to change the application path
in performed requests to compromise the local application
or file-system of a mobile device. Attackers are for example able to
request environment variables or a sensitive system path.

The directory-traversal web vulnerability is located in the main
application path request performed via GET method. Attackers are
able to request for example the local ./etc/ path of the web-server by
changing the local path in the performed request itself.
In a first request the attack changes the path, the host redirects to
complete the adress with "..". Then the attacker just
attaches a final slash to its request and the path can be accessed via
web-browser to download local files.

Exploitation of the directory traversal web vulnerability requires no
privileged web-application user account or user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in information
leaking by unauthorized file access and mobile application compromise.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The directory traversal vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with
access to the wifi interface in a local network without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability
follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a restriction of the visible and
accessable ./etc/ path in the app container.
Disallow path changes in the client-side get method requests and
validate them securely.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the directory travsersal web vulnerability in the
ios mobile application is estimated as high.
