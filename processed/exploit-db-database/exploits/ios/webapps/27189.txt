Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
A remote command execution web vulnerability is detected in the WebDisk v3.0.2 application (Apple iOS - iPad & iPhone).
The vulnerability allows remote attacker to execute code inside of a vulnerable web application module to compromise the device.

The vulnerability is located in the afgetdir.ma file when processing to request manipulated path parameters. Remote attackers can
execute code from the main application index by using the upload input field. The code inside of the file upload field does not
require to choose a file for an upload but executes the context directly via GET variable. The result is a web application code
execution from the main index module. The code will be executed from the listing location under the upload input field of the
webdisk wifi application.

Exploitation of the vulnerability does not require user interaction or a privilege application user account.
Successful exploitation results webdisk web-application or apple device compromise via remote code execution.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Upload - Input Field

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] afgetdir.ma

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] p (path)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir Listing


Proof of Concept:
=================
The remote command execution vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privilege application user account or
user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Solution:
=========
To fix the command execution parse the p variable and encode the input on direct GET requests.
Parse and encode the output listing of the file input in the main file dir index module.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the remote command execution web application vulnerability is estimated as critical.
