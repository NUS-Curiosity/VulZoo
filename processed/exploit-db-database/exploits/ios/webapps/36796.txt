Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Linkus
Product: Photo Manager Pro - iOS Mobile Web Application (Wifi) 4.4.0


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local file include web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Linkus Photo Manager Pro v4.4.0 iOS mobile web-application.
The local file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system specific path
commands to compromise the mobile web-application.

The web vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the `upload.action` module. Remote attackers are able to inject own files with
malicious `filename` values in the `upload.action` POST method request to compromise the mobile web-application. The local file/path include
execution occcurs in the index dir listing of the wifi interface. The attacker is able to inject the local file include request by usage of
the `wifi interface` in connection with the vulnerable upload service module.

Remote attackers are also able to exploit the filename validation issue in combination with persistent injected script codes to execute unique
local malicious attack requests. The attack vector is located on the application-side of the wifi service and the request method to inject is POST.
To exploit the bug it is required to use the local device > wifi sync or (remote) the wifi gui.

The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.9.
Exploitation of the local file include vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account. Successful exploitation
of the local file include web vulnerability results in mobile application or device compromise.

Request Method(s):
					[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] upload.action

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
					[+] filename

Affected Module(s):
					[+] disp_photo.action


Proof of Concept (PoC):

http://localhost:8080/disp_photo.action?filename=


Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure validation of the filename value in the upload POST method request. Restrict the filename input and
disallow special chars. Ensure that not multiple file extensions are loaded in the filename value to prevent arbitrary file upload attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of thelocal file inelcude web vulnerability in the photo manager wifi service is estimated as high. (CVSS 6.9)
