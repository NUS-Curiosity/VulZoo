High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An arbitrary file upload web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Air Drive Plus v2.4 iOS web-application.
The arbitrary file upload web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests
or system specific path commands to compromise the mobile web-application.

The web vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the `Upload` module. Remote attackers are able to inject own files with
malicious `filename` values in the `Upload` POST method request to compromise the mobile web-application. The local file/path include
execution occcurs in the index file dir listing and sub folders of the wifi interface. The attacker is able to inject the lfi payload
by usage of the wifi interface or local file sync function.

Attackers are also able to exploit the filename issue in combination with persistent injected script code to execute different malicious
attack requests. The attack vector is located on the application-side of the wifi service and the request method to inject is POST.

The security risk of the local file include vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.7.
Exploitation of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privilege web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability results in mobile application compromise or connected device component compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Upload

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:8000/)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The arbitrary file upload web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker without privilege web-application user acocunt or user interaction.
