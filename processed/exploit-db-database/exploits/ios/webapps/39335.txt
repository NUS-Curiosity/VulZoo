Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
Transfer files to and from any computer connected to the same WiFi network as your iPhone or iPad using just a web browser! Just drag and drop
files into the browser (requires a current version of Chrome, Firefox or Safari) and watch the files appear on your device. You can also connect
to other iOS devices that have the Secure Item Hub app and transfer files directly between devices!

Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
An arbitrary file upload web vulnerability has been discovered in the Secure Item Hub - WiFi File Sharing mobile iOS wifi web-application.
The arbitrary file upload web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system specific path
commands to compromise the mobile web-application.

The web vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the `Upload` module. Remote attackers are able to inject own files with malicious `filename`
values in the `Upload` POST method request to compromise the mobile web-application. The local file/path include execution occcurs in the index file dir
listing and sub folders of the wifi interface. The attacker is able to inject the lfi payload by usage of the wifi interface or the local file sync function.
The attacker can also attach multiple file extensions to bypass the web-server file validation to execute a malicious web-shell finally. Remote attackers can
exchange the filename with a double or tripple extension via POST method to bypass the upload validation and filter process. After the upload the attacker access
the file with one extension and exchange it with the other one to execute for example own php codes.

Attackers are also able to exploit the filename issue in combination with persistent injected script code to execute different malicious attack requests.
The attack vector is located on the application-side of the wifi service and the request method to inject is POST.

The security risk of the local file include vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 8.7.
Exploitation of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account.
Successful exploitation of the arbitrary file upload vulnerability results in mobile application compromise or connected device component compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Upload
				[+] Rename

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename
				[+] pairs

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:8000/)



1.2
A local command/path injection web vulnerabilities has been discovered  in the official Secure Item Hub - WiFi File Sharing mobile iOS wifi web-application.
The vulnerability allows attackers to inject local commands via vulnerable system values to compromise the apple mobile iOS application.

The vulnerability is located in the vulnerable `devicename` value that becomes visible in the `file dir (index)` module. Local attackers are able to inject own
malicious system specific commands or path value requests in the vulnerable `devicename` value. The execution of the local command inject occurs in the `index`
module of the mobile application. The attacker is able to manipulate the header name information of the application by preparing to change the local devicename.
The encoding of the vulnerable values in the index header module is broken.

The attack vector is on the application-side and the injection requires physical device access or a local low privileged user account. Local attackers are also
able to exploit the filename validation issue in combination with persistent injected script codes to execute different local malicious attacks requests.

The security risk of the local command/path inject vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.1.
Exploitation of the command/path inject vulnerability requires a low privileged iOS device account with restricted access and no user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized execution of system specific commands and unauthorized path value requests to
compromise the mobile iOS application or the connected device components.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [SYNC]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Header Location - Web Application

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] devicename (HierarchyText)

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:8000/)




1.3
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered  in the official Secure Item Hub - WiFi File Sharing mobile iOS wifi web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attacker to inject malicious persistent script codes to the application-side of the mobile application.

The vulnerability is located in the path and name (class) values of the `New Folder` and `NewTextFile` modules. The request method to inject is POST and
the attack vector is located on the application-side of the mobile app. Remote attackers are able to inject via POST own malicious script codes to compromise
the wifi web-application index file dir listing. The validation and encoding of the `New Folder` and `NewTextFile` modules are broken and allows to inject
malicious persistent script codes.

The security risk of the application-side web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.6.
Exploitation of the application-side web vulnerability requires no privileged web-application user account and only low or medium user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities results in persistent phishing, session hijacking, persistent external redirect to malicious
sources and application-side manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
					[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
					[+] NewTextFile
					[+] New Folder

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
					[+] path
					[+] name (class)

Affected Module(s):
					[+] Index File Dir Listing (http://localhost:8000/)

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1.1
The arbitrary file upload vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and validation of the filename value in the upload POST method request.
Restrict the input and disallow special chars or script code tags to prevent an attack. Disallow usage of multiple file extensions and approve them as well.

1.2
The local command inject vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the header location in the file dir listing index, were the devicename is displayed.

1.3
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be patched by a secure encode and parse of the `path` and `name (class)` values in
the `NewTextFile` or `New Folder` modules. Disallow usage of special chars on input to prevent persistent script code injection attacks.
Encode the index output values to prevent the execution point of the issue.


Security Risk:
==============
1.1
The security risk of the arbitrary file upload web vulnerability in the filename value on upload is estimated as high. (CVSS 7.3)

1.2
The local command inject web vulnerability in the device name value is estimated as medium. (CVSS 6.1)
