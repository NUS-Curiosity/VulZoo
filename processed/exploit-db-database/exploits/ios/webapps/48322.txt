Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent cross site scripting web vulnerability has been discovered
in the official SuperBackup v2.0.5 ios mobile application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector to compromise the mobile
web-application from the application-side.

The cross site scripting web vulnerabilities are located in the
`newPath`, `oldPath` & `filename` parameters of the vcf listing module.
Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious persistent script
codes as vcf filename to the main index list. The request method to
inject is POST and the attack vector of the vulnerability is located on
the application-side. The injection point is located at the vcf
filename or import. The execution point occurs in the main index list
after the import or insert.

Remote attackers are able to inject own script codes to the client-side
requested vulnerable web-application parameters. The attack
vector of the vulnerability is persistent and the request method to
inject/execute is POST. The vulnerabilities are classic client-side
cross site scripting vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation of the
vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing
attacks, persistent external redirects to malicious source and
persistent manipulation of affected application modules.

Request Method(s):
[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
[+] VCF

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
[+] newPath (path - vcf filename)
[+] oldPath (path - vcf filename)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The cross site scripting vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers without privileged user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the cross site scripting
vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
1. Parse and filter the vcf name values next to add, edit or imports to
prevent an execution
2. Restrict and filter in the index listing the vcf names to sanitize
the output


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent vcf cross site scripting web
vulnerability is estimated as medium.
