==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Core Research Team discovered file include web vulnerability in the official Wifi Drive Pro v1.2 iOS mobile application.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-03-13: Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Mindspeak Software
Product: Wifi Drive Pro - iOS Mobile Web Application 1.2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local file include web vulnerability has been discovered in the official Mindspeak Software - Wifi Drive Pro v1.2 iOS mobile web-application.
The local file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system specific path commands
to compromise the mobile web-application.

The web vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the `file upload` module. Remote attackers are able to inject own files with malicious
`filename` values in the `file upload` POST method request to compromise the mobile web-application. The local file/path include execution occcurs in
the index file dir listing of the wifi interface. The attacker is able to inject the local file include request by usage of the `wifi interface`
in connection with the vulnerable file upload POST method request.

Remote attackers are also able to exploit the filename issue in combination with persistent injected script codes to execute different malicious
attack requests. The attack vector is located on the application-side of the wifi service and the request method to inject is POST.

The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.4.
Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account. Successful exploitation
of the local file include web vulnerability results in mobile application compromise or connected device component compromise.

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure validation of the filename value in the upload POST method request. Restrict the filename input and
disallow special chars. Ensure that not multiple file extensions are loaded in the filename value to prevent arbitrary file upload attacks.
Encode the output in the file dir index list with the vulnerable name value to prevent an application-side injection attacks.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability in the upload POST method request is estimated as high. (CVSS 6.3)
