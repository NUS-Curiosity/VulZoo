Product: ChatSecure IM - iOS Mobile Web Application 2.2.4


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation web vulnerability has been discovered in the ChatSecure IM v2.2.4 iOS mobile web-application.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side of the chat im ios app.

The issue is located in the main message body context. During the tests we discovered that the chat message validation
impact a misconfiguration. In the message body context it is possible to inject persistent script code in splitted combination.
The attacker activates the chat interact with a victim and can send malicious messages that compromise the other device on
interaction. The validation parses script code tags but does not secure validate embed script codes with onload in object tags.

The security risk of the local persistent vulnerability in the chat message body is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability
scoring system) count of 6.0. Exploitation of the application-side vulnerability requires no privileged app user account or user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects to malicious
source and persistent manipulation of affected or connected module context.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [Bluetooth - Nearby Sync]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Message Board Index

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] message body context

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Message Board Index - Chat Index


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent input validation web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged application user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the web vulnerability follow the provided steps and information below to continue.

1. Install the mobile application chat iOS app (https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/chatsecure-verschlusselter/id464200063)
2. Interact with an user account and inject the payload to the message body
3. The code executes at both sites of the user clients on the application-side of the service
4. Successful reproduce of the vulnerability!

PoC: Payload #1

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of embed script codes in connection object tags.
Filter the message body and restrict the input to disallow special char injection with application-side attack vector.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability in the secure chat im is estimated as high.
