==================================
2014-02-12:    Public Disclosure (Vulnerability Laboratory)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Apple AppStore
Product: jDisk (stickto) iOS - Mobile Web Application 2.0.3


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Critical


Technical Details & Description:
================================
1.1
Multiple remote code execution web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official sticktos jDisk v2.0.3 iOS mobile web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute unauthorized system specific codes or commands to compromise the affected system/service.

The vulnerabilities are located in the `New+ Text file` and `New+ Folder` function of the jdisk wifi application file manager web-interface.
Remote attackers are able to inject own system specific codes by manipulation of the folder- & file name value in the add procedure.
The code execution occurs in the main file dir index and sub category listing, the add new edit file but also in the the app status
notification message context. The security risk of the remote code execution vulnerabilities in the add new folder- & text file function
are estimated as critical with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 9.4(+)|(-)9.5.

Exploitation of the code execution vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged mobile web-application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the remote code execution vulnerabilities results in mobile application or connected device component compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] New/Add Folder
				[+] New/Add Text File

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] folder name
				[+] text-file name

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index & Sub Category - File Dir Listing
				[+] Notification Message
				[+] File Edit - Header


1.2
A directory-traversal web vulnerability has been discovered in the official sticktos jDisk v2.0.3 iOS mobile web-application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized access system path variables or web-server data to compromise the application.

The local vulnerability is located in the `folderContent to folder` value of the mobile application. Remote attackers can exploit the bug
by usage of a manipulated GET method request to unauthorized access app/device paths or folders. The local issue is a classic directory-traversal
web vulnerability. The execution of the malicious dt string in the foldercontent to folder path request occurs in the context of the requested
interface page itself. The security risk of the directory traversal web vulnerability is estimated as high(-) with a cvss (common vulnerability
scoring system) count of 6.6(+)|(-)6.7.

Exploitation of the directory traversal web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged mobile web-application user account with password.
Successful exploitation of the path traversal web vulnerability results in mobile application or connected device component compromise.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [GET]

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] __FD__?action

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] folderContent&folder=

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index & Sub Category - File Dir Listing



1.3
A local file include web vulnerability has been discovered in the official sticktos jDisk v2.0.3 iOS mobile web-application.
The local file include web vulnerability allows remote attackers to unauthorized include local file/path requests or system
specific path commands to compromise the web-application or mobile device.

The web vulnerability is located in the `file name` value of the `Upload > Uplaod Files` module POST method request. Remote attackers
are able to inject own files with malicious filename to compromise the mobile application. The attack vector is persistent and the
request method is POST. The local file/path include execution occcurs in the main file dir index- or sub category item listing of
the file manager. The security risk of the local file include web vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability
scoring system) count of 8.3(+)|(-)8.4.

Exploitation of the local file include web vulnerability requires no user interaction or privileged web-application user account
with password. Successful exploitation of the local web vulnerability results in mobile application or connected device component
compromise by unauthorized local file include web attacks.

Request Method(s):
				[+] [POST]

Vulnerable Input(s):
				[+] Upload > Upload Files

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index File Dir Item Listing
				[+] Sub Category File Dir Item Listing
