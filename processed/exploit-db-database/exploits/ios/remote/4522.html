<!--
The iPhone / iTouch tif exploit is now officially released!
source: http://www.toc2rta.com/

So its offical we have released the tiff exploit code.
You can navigate in safari to http://jailbreak.toc2rta.com
on your Itouch or Iphone 1.1.1. It will crash your Safari
but then you will be able to browse the file system with
full read/write access. This is only for people who understand
what they are doing. You will need IPHUC and some knowledge of
how to put/get files.
