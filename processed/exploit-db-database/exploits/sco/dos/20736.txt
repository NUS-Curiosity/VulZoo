SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 (and possibly earlier versions) ships with several suid bin executables used in printer administration and related tasks.

This includes lpforms, a component used to manage and configure print destinations, devices and printer interface programs.

'lpforms' contains a locally exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability. If a command line parameter argument is of excessive length, a stack overflow condition will occur.

An attacker may exploit this vulnerability execute arbitrary code with effective user 'bin' privileges.

/opt/K/SCO/Unix/5.0.6Ga/usr/lib/lpforms `perl -e 'print "A" x 7000'`
