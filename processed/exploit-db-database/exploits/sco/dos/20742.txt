SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 (and possibly earlier versions) ships with a suid 'bin' executable called 'recon'.

'recon' is used to buffer and forward escape sequences from a user's input to timing-sensitive applications.

'recon' contains a locally exploitable buffer overflow condition present in the handling of command-line parameters.

If properly exploited, this can yield user 'bin' privileges to the attacker.
