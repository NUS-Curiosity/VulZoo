SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 (and possibly earlier versions) ships with several suid bin executables used in printer administration and related tasks.

This includes lpshut, a component used to shut down the LP print service. 'lpshut' contains a locally exploitable bufffer overflow due to a lack of bounds checking during operations performed on user-supplied data.

An attacker may exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with effective userid 'bin' privileges.
