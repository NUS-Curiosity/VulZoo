SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 (and possibly earlier versions) ships with several suid bin executables used in printer administration and related tasks.

This includes lpusers, a component used to set the queue priority of jobs submitted to the LP print service by users.
'lpusers' contains a locally exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability that occurs when commandline arguments are of excessive length.

If properly exploited, this can yield root privilege to the attacker.
