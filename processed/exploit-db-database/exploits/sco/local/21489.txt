A vulnerability has been reported in the scoadmin utility that may allow a local attacker to overwrite any file. The vulnerability is due to the predictable naming of temporary files used by scoadmin. When writing to temporary files, there are no checks to ensure that it does not already exist. Symbolic links will also be followed. This behaviour may be exploited by local attackers to corrupt arbitrary files.

ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/tclerror.1195.log

If the process ID of the SCOadmin process is 1195, /etc/passwd will be overwritten.
