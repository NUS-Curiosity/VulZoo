Multiple BSD distributions are prone to a memory-corruption vulnerability because the software fails to properly bounds-check data used as an array index.

An attacker can exploit this issue to cause applications to crash with a segmentation fault, denying service to legitimate users. Given the nature of this issue, the attacker may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

The following are vulnerable:

OpenBSD 4.6
NetBSD 5.0.1

The following example is available:

printf %.1100000000f 1.1
