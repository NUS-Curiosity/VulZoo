BSD PPP is prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Attackers can leverage this issue to crash the application and deny service to legitimate users. Given the nature of the issue, arbitrary code execution may also be possible, but this has not been confirmed.

This issue affects FreeBSD 6.3 and unspecified versions of NetBSD and OpenBSD; other versions may also be affected.
