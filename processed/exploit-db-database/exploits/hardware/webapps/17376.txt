###### NOTE: The aastra ip phone software is also vulnerability for unauthorized person to access the web interface.

## DATA DISCLOSURE:
# The data disclosure vulnerability found in the section of 'Global SIP' / 'Line 1' of 'Aastra IP Phone' software.
# The vulnerability allows the attacker to disclosure the password of the username for the phone line that connected.
# To exploit the vulnerability and dicluse the data we need to access to the 'Aastra IP Phone' by this url 'http://address/globalSIPsettings.html'.
# Or to the following address 'http://address/SIPsettingsLine1.html', we have Caller ID, Authentication Name,  and Password..
# Then we can see in the source code by the field 'password' and then we see the magic! thats is the password for the username by the sip server.
# Now if we already have the sip server, username and password so we can connect to it with any softphone and make our calls.
