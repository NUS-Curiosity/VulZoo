=======================================
The Router usually servers html files & are protected with HTTP Basic
Authentication. However, the CGI files does not protect this file from
getting exposed to public. A Simple GET request would be needed to
made to router that would give a remote attacker an opportunity to
modify router PPPoE configurations, setup malicious configurations
which later could lead to disrupt network & its activities.
