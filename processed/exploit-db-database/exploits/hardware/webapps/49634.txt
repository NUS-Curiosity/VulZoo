Vendor: NUEVAS COMUNICACIONES IBERIA, S.A.
Product web page: https://www.nucom.es
Affected version: 5.07.90_multi_NCM01
                  5.07.89_multi_NCM01

Summary: The NC routers upgrades your network to the next
generation of WiFi. With combined wireless speeds of up to
1750 Mbps, the device provides better speeds and wireless
range. Includes 2 FXS ports for any VoIP service. If you
prefer a wired connection, the NC routers have gigabit
ports to provide an incredibly fast, lag-free experience.
3.0 ports allow you to power a robust home Internet network
by sharing printers, flash storage, FTP servers, or media
players.

Desc: The application suffers from a privilege escalation
vulnerability. The non-privileged default user (user:user)
can elevate his/her privileges by sending a HTTP GET request
to the configuration backup endpoint and disclose the http
super password (admin credentials) in Base64 encoded value.
Once authenticated as admin, an attacker will be granted
access to the additional and privileged pages.

Tested on: GoAhead-Webs
           Tenda
