Hard-coded credentials and command-injection vulnerabilities on BigPond 3G21WB
==============================================================================

[ADVISORY INFORMATION]
Title:           Hard-coded credentials and command-injection vulnerabilities
     on BigPond 3G21WB
Discovery date:  17/09/2012
Release date:    11/10/2012

[VULNERABILITY INFORMATION]
Class:           Authentication bypass, command-injection

[AFFECTED PRODUCTS]
We confirm the following device models to be affected:
   * BigPond 3G21WB

Similar routers are probably vulnerable to these very same issues.

[VULNERABILITY DETAILS]
The firmware running on the affected routers is subject to multiple security
issues that allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain administrative access to
the device and execute arbitrary commands. In the following paragraphs we
describe the details of the vulnerabilities we identified.

a) Hard-coded credentials
   A user can authenticate to the web server running on the device using the
   credentials "Monitor:bigpond1". These credentials are hard-coded, and cannot
   be changed by a normal user.

b) Command-injection vulnerability
   The "ping.cgi" web page is subject to a command-injection vulnerability, as
   the server-side script does not properly validate user-supplied input.

   The following URL exploits this issue, executing the "ls /" command:
   http://<device IP address>/ping.cgi?DIA_IPADDRESS=;%20cat%20/etc/passwd

[REMEDIATION]
We are not aware of an updated firmware that corrects the issues described in
this advisory. We suggest users to disable web access on the WAN side.
