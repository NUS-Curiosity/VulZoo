============ Vulnerability Overview: ============

* OS Command Execution:

	parameter: maxmtu

The vulnerability is caused by missing input validation in the maxmtu parameter and can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands. It is possible to use Netcat to fully compromise the device.

http://Target-IP/cgi-bin/setConfigSettings?maxmtu=%26COMMAND%26&hddstandby=2&hddacoustics=160&timeroffsetstart=0&timeroffsetstop=0&audiochannelspriority=&showsatpos=on&trustedhosts=&epgcachepath=%2Fhdd&epgsqlpath=%2Fvar%2Flib%2Fsqlite

It is possible to shorten the URL to the following:

http://Target-IP/cgi-bin/setConfigSettings?maxmtu=%26COMMAND%26

There is Netcat preinstalled on the device. It is a very small edition of netcat, so you have to play a bit with it but you will get it ;)

* stored XSS:

Box Control -> Configuration -> Webserver -> User, Password

	parameter: AuthUser, AuthPassword

Box Control -> Configuration -> Settings

	parameter: audiochannelspriority

Injecting scripts into the parameter xxx reveals that this parameter is not properly validated for malicious input.
