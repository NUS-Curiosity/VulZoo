Xavi 7968 ADSL Router is prone to cross-site scripting, HTML-injection and cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities.

The attacker can exploit the issues to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the vulnerable site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or perform certain administrative functions on victim's behalf. Other attacks are also possible.
