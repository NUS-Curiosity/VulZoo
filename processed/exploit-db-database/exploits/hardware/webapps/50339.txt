Summary: FatPipe Networks invented the concept of router-clustering,
which provides the highest level of reliability, redundancy, and speed
of Internet traffic for Business Continuity and communications. FatPipe
WARP achieves fault tolerance for companies by creating an easy method
of combining two or more Internet connections of any kind over multiple
ISPs. FatPipe utilizes all paths when the lines are up and running,
dynamically balancing traffic over the multiple lines, and intelligently
failing over inbound and outbound IP traffic when ISP services and/or
components fail.

Desc: Improper access control occurs when the application provides direct
access to objects based on user-supplied input. As a result of this vulnerability
attackers can bypass authorization and access resources behind protected
pages.

Tested on: Apache-Coyote/1.1
