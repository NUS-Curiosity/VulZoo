Mark Stanislav - mstanislav@duosecurity.com


I. DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------
Stem Innovation's IP camera called ‘IZON’ utilizes numerous hard-coded credentials within its Linux distribution and also the hidden web application running on the camera. These sets of credentials are never exposed to the end-user and cannot be changed through any normal operation of the camera. Further, using the web interface credentials will provide access to a camera stream and configuration details, including third-party API keys.


II. TESTED VERSION
---------------------------------------
iOS Mobile Application: 1.0.5
Camera Firmware: 2.0.2


III. PoC EXPLOIT
---------------------------------------
1) Telnet Credentials
* "root" with a password of "stemroot"
* "admin" with a password of "/ADMIN/"
* "mg3500" with a password of "merlin"

2) HTTP Credentials (http://camera-ip/mobileye/)
* "user" with a password of "user"


IV. SOLUTION
---------------------------------------
Update to the latest firmware and hope for the best.
