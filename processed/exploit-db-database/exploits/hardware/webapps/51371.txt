## Exploit Title: Sielco PolyEco Digital FM Transmitter 2.0.6 - Account Takeover / Lockout / EoP
## Exploit Author: LiquidWorm


Vendor: Sielco S.r.l
Product web page: https://www.sielco.org
Affected version: PolyEco1000 CPU:2.0.6 FPGA:10.19
                  PolyEco1000 CPU:1.9.4 FPGA:10.19
                  PolyEco1000 CPU:1.9.3 FPGA:10.19
                  PolyEco500 CPU:1.7.0 FPGA:10.16
                  PolyEco300 CPU:2.0.2 FPGA:10.19
                  PolyEco300 CPU:2.0.0 FPGA:10.19

Summary: PolyEco is the innovative family of high-end digital
FM transmitters of Sielco. They are especially suited as high
performance power system exciters or compact low-mid power
transmitters. The same cabinet may in fact be fitted with 50,
100, 300, 500, 1000W power stage (PolyEco50, 100, 300, 500,
1000).

All features can be controlled via the large touch-screen display
4.3" or remotely. Many advanced features are inside by default
in the basic version such as: stereo and RDS encoder, audio
change-over, remote-control via LAN and SNMP, "FFT" spectral
analysis of the audio sources, SFN synchronization and much more.

Desc: The application suffers from an authentication bypass,
account takeover/lockout and elevation of privileges vulnerability
that can be triggered by directly calling the users object and
effectively modifying the password of the two constants user/role
(user/admin). This can be exploited by an unauthenticated adversary
by issuing a single POST request to the vulnerable endpoint and
gain unauthorized access to the affected device with administrative
privileges.

Tested on: lwIP/2.1.1 (http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip)
