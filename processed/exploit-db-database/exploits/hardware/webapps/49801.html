Vendor: Sipwise GmbH

                  NGCP www_admin version 3.6.7

Summary: Sipwise C5 (also known as NGCP - the Next Generation Communication Platform)
is a SIP-based Open Source Class 5 VoIP soft-switch platform that allows you to provide
rich telephony services. It offers a wide range of features (e.g. call forwarding, voicemail,
conferencing etc.) that can be configured by end users in the self-care web interface.
For operators, it offers a web-based administrative panel that allows them to configure
subscribers, SIP peerings, billing profiles, and other entities. The administrative web
panel also shows the real-time statistics for the whole system. For tight integration
into existing infrastructures, Sipwise C5 provides a powerful REST API interface.

Desc: The application interface allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP requests
without performing any validity checks to verify the requests. This can be exploited to
perform certain actions with administrative privileges if a logged-in user visits a malicious
web site.

Tested on: Apache/2.2.22 (Debian)
