DreamBox DM800 is prone to a local file-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to adequately validate user-supplied input.

Exploiting this vulnerability would allow an attacker to obtain potentially sensitive information from local files on computers running the vulnerable application. This may aid in further attacks.

DreamBox DM800 versions 1.5rc1 and prior are vulnerable.
