[ 0x01 - Directory Traversal ]

A10 Networks (Soft)AX <=2.6.1-GR1-P5 & <=2.7.0 build 217 is prone to an
unauthenticated directory traversal vulnerability.
It's possible to download any file on the remote AX device with root
privileges, without the need to authenticate to the website.

The bug was fixed earlier in A10 Tracking ID "82150" according to the
release notes, however the fix is not sufficient and can be bypassed.

The new protection seems to make sure files are under the /a10data/tmp dir
(https://<IP>/xml/downloads/?filename=/a10data/tmp/).

By sending a GET request to
"https://<IP>/xml/downloads/?filename=/a10data/tmp/../.."
and thus keeping /a10data/tmp, we can bypass this. So if we would like
to download the file /etc/shadow we send a GET request to "https://
<IP>/xml/downloads/?filename=/a10data/tmp/../../etc/passwd".

Or if we would like to download a certificate key file: "https://
<IP>/xml/downloads/?filename=/a10data/tmp/../../a10data/key/domain.com"

WARNING: Downloading a file will delete it from the AX device!
