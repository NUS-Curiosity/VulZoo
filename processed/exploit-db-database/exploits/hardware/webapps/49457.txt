Summary: IP camera with optical character recognition (OCR) software for automatic
number plate recognition (ANPR) also equipped with ADR system that enables it to read
the Hazard Identification Number (HIN, also known as the Kemler Code) and UN number
of any vehicle captured in free-flow mode. TARGA is fully accurate in reading number
plates of vehicles travelling at high speed. Its varifocal, wide-angle lens makes
this camera suitable for all installation conditions. Its built-in OCR software works
as an automatic and independent system without the need of a computer, thus giving
autonomy to the device even in the event of an interruption in the connection between
the camera and the operations centre.

Desc: Unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in the
Selea ANPR camera within several functionalities. The application parses user supplied
data in the POST JSON parameters 'ipnotify_address' and 'url' to construct an image
request or check DNS for IP notification. Since no validation is carried out on the
parameters, an attacker can specify an external domain and force the application to
make an HTTP request to an arbitrary destination host. This can be used by an external
attacker for example to bypass firewalls and initiate a service and network enumeration
on the internal network through the affected application.

Tested on: GNU/Linux 3.10.53 (armv7l)
           PHP/5.6.22
           selea_httpd
           HttpServer/0.1
