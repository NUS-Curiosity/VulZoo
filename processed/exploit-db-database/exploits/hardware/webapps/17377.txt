# The vulnerability allows the attacker to disclosure the password of the username for the phone line that connected.
# To exploit the vulnerability and discluse the data we need to access to the 'Polycom IP Phone' by this url 'http://address/reg_1.htm'.
# Then we can see in the source code by the field 'reg.1.auth.password' and then we see the magic! thats is the password for the username by the sip server.
# Now if we already have the sip server, username and password so we can connect to it with any softphone and make our calls.
