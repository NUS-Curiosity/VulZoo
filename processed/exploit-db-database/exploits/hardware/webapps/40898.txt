-Vulnerability
An user who has access to send DHCP via either VPN or Wireless connection can serve a host name with script tags to trigger XSS.

Could be potentially used to connect to open or guest WIFI hotspot and inject stored XSS into admin panel and steal cookie for authentication.

Then visit the "view who's connected" page.

-Proof Of Concept
Set /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

send host-name "<script>alert('xss')</script>";
