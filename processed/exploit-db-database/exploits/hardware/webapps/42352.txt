1. doesn't require credentials to fetch snapshot like this: http://192.168.0.200/ipcam/jpeg
2. allows "viewer" level user to fetch any camera setting, eg admin user and password: http://192.168.0.200/vb.htm?adminid&adminpwd


there is newer firmware available from the vendor, but I haven't tested on that one.
