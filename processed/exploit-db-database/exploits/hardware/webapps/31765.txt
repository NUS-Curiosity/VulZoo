Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Barracuda Networks
Product: Message Archiver 650 - Appliance Application 3.1.0.914


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent input validation vulnerability has been discovered in the official Barracuda Networks Message Archiver 650 v3.1.0.914 appliance web-application.
The remote vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes on the application-side of the vulnerable message archiver module.

The vulnerability is located in the `Benutzer > Neu Anlegen > Rolle: Auditor > Domänen` module. Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious script
codes with persistent attack vector in the vulnerable domain_list_table-r0 parameter. The execution of the script code occurs in the domain_list_table-r0
and user_domain_admin:1 appliance application response context. The request method is POST and the attack vector is persistent on the application-side of
the barracuda networks message archiver appliance. The security risk of the input validation web vulnerability is
estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.5(+)|(-)3.6.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privileged or restricted application user account with low or medium user interaction. Successful exploitation
of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing, persistent external redirects and persistent manipulation of module context.

Request Method(s):
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Benutzer > Neu Anlegen > Rolle: Auditor > Domänen

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] domain_list_table-r0



Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker with low privileged application user account and low required user inter action.
