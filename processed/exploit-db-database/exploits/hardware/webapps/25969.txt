Exploitation-Technique:

Local and Remote

Details:
========
I found a bug in the Netgear WPN824v3 wireless router, everyone is able
to download the full config file without authorization.
Unfortunately the config file is not htaccess protected.
Tested with latest firmware V1.0.8_1.0.6.

Proof of Concept:
=================
The vulnerability can be exploited with your browser:

http://[local-ip]/cgi-bin/NETGEAR_wpn824v3.cfg

If remote management is enabled:

http://[remote-ip]:8080/cgi-bin/NETGEAR_wpn824v3.cfg

Workaround:
=========
Disable the remote management feature!
