Affected version: 0.2.40

Summary: REST Gateway between Domoticz and Imperihome ISS. Domoticz is a home automation
system with a pretty wide library of supported devices, ranging from weather stations to
smoke detectors to remote controls, and a large number of additional third-party integrations
are documented on the project's website. It is designed with an HTML5 frontend, making it
accessible from desktop browsers and most modern smartphones, and is lightweight, running
on many low-power devices like the Raspberry Pi.

Desc: MyDomoAtHome REST API is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability due to
improper access control enforcement. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this,
via a specially crafted request to gain access to sensitive information.

Tested on: NodeJS: 10.15.0, 8.15.1, 8.15.0, 8.11.1, 8.9.4, 4.8.7, 4.2.2
           Webmanager/Engine: EJS
