The vulnerable versions are v2.2.2.1611 and earlier

Proof of Concept:
HTML Email including the following payload will execute Javascript statements when the victim open the email using the vulnerable version.

Payload:
<body>
<div>
<script>alert('XSS Here')</script>
</div>
</body>

Remediation:
I worked with the Good people to close the issue, I provided some guidance and feedback and agreed with them to not disclose it until they fix it.

The new release is now available:
Update the "Good for Enterprise" iOS application to 2.2.4.1659 or newer

Many thanks
