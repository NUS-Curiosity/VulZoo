Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A remote cross-site request forgery vulnerability has been discovered in the official Huawei Flybox B660 3G/4G router product series.
The security vulnerability allows a remote attacker to perform unauthenticated application requests with non-expired browser session
credentials to unauthorized execute specific backend functions.

The vulnerability is located in the `/htmlcode/html/sms.cgi` and `/htmlcode/html/sms_new.asp` modules and the `RequestFile` parameter
of the localhost path URL. Remote attackers are able to send sms messages as malicious bomb to other phone numbers from any Huawei
Flybox B660 via unauthenticated POST method request.

The security risk of the csrf web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 4.4.
Exploitation of the csrf web vulnerability requires a low privilege web-application user account and medium or high user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthenticated application requests and manipulation of affected or connected
device backend modules.
