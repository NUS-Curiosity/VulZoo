# Exploit Title: RAD SecFlow-1v SF_0290_2.3.01.26 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (Reboot)
# Date: 2020-08-31
# Exploit Author: Uriel Yochpaz and Jonatan Schor
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.rad.com/products/secflow-1v-IIoT-Gateway
# Version: SecFlow-1v os-image SF_0290_2.3.01.26
# Tested on: RAD SecFlow-1v
# CVE : N/A

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of RAD SecFlow-1v
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.
The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on
an affected device.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the
interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the
affected user.
This could be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2020-13260.

# Proof of Concept
By persuading an authenticated user to open a web page containing the
following code:
<img src="https://SecFlow-1v_IP/devicereboot.php?restart=1&isSubmitted=1">
A reboot operation would begin.
This attack could execute any operation available at the web-based
management interface (File uploads, Scheduled and immediate reboots,
Factory reset etc.)

# Full Account Takeover
As mentioned above, this exploit could be used in conjunction with
CVE-2020-13260 (Stored-XSS), by using the CSRF exploit to upload a
malicious file to a Stored-XSS vulnerabale page, which could allow Full
Account Takeover.
