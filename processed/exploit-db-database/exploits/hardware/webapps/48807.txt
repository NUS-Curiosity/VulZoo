# CVE : N/A

A Stored-XSS vulnerability was found in multiple pages in the web-based
management interface of RAD SecFlow-1v.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file
as the OVPN file in Configuration-Services-Security-OpenVPN-Config or as
the static key file in Configuration-Services-Security-OpenVPN-Static Keys.
These files content is presented to users while executing malicious stored
JavaScript code.
This could be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2020-13259

# Proof of Concept
Upload a file containing the following JS code:
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
Refresh the page and observe the malicious JS code execute every time you
browse the compromised page.

# Full Account Takeover

CVE-2020-13259 (CSRF), by using the CSRF exploit to upload a malicious file
to a Stored-XSS vulnerabale page, which could allow Full Account Takeover.
