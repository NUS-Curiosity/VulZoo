**Vulnerabilitty details**

The CSRF is present in the CGI formulary used to create and modify
users of the web interface of the camera (/set_users.cgi). This CSRF
would allow a malicious attacker to create users in the camera web
interface (including administrator users) if he is able to lure the
legitimate administrator of the camera to visit a web controlled by
the attacker.

An example of the process to exploit this vulnerability:

1- A webcam administrator is already logged in the camera web interface.

2- A malicious user knows it and send a link to this administrator
pointing to a web controlled by this attacker
(http://example.com/conceptronic_csrf.html). In this web, the attacker
placed an image with the following code:

  <img alt="csrf image"
src="http://<victim_camera_server>/set_users.cgi?next_url=rebootme.htm&user1=attacker&pwd1=attacker&pri1=2&user2=&pwd2=&pri2=0&user3=&pwd3=&pri3=0&user4=&pwd4=&pri4=0&user5=&pwd5=&pri5=0&user6=&pwd6=&pri6=0&user7=&pwd7=&pri7=0&user8=&pwd8=&pri8=0">

3- The webcam administrator visit the link.

4- The page http://example.com/test_csrf.html tries to load the image
by making a GET request to the pointed URL, thus, making the
legitimate administrator to create a new user identified by "attacker"
and password "attacker".

A video was uploaded to youtube showing this behaviour:

This issue can be fixed by adding an additional step to the user
creation CGI, either requesting the administrator password again
before creating/modifying any user or creating a hidden random token
for each form (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)
