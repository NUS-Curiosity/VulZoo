============ Vulnerability Overview: ============

    * OS Command Injection (unauthenticated)

=> Parameter cmd

The vulnerability is caused by missing access restrictions and missing input validation in the cmd parameter and can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.
It is possible to start a telnetd to compromise the device.

WARNING: You do not need to be authenticated to the device!

starting a telnet server:

cmd=telnetd;

You do not need to be authenticated to the device for executing the malicious commands. You could prepare the whole request and execute it without any authentication details.

For example you could start the telnetd on other ports and interfaces. So with this you are able to get a full shell *h00ray*

Nmap Scan after starting the telnetd:

    * Information disclosure:

Nice server banner to detect this type of devices easily:
Server: Linux, HTTP/1.1, DIR-300 Ver 2.12
Server: Linux, HTTP/1.1, DIR-600 Ver 2.12

    * For changing the current password there is no request to the current password

With this vulnerability an attacker is able to change the current password without knowing it. The attacker needs access to an authenticated browser.

    * Insecure Cryptographic Storage:

There is no password hashing implemented and so it is saved in plain text on the system:
# cat var/passwd
"admin" "test" "0"

Positive Technologies has released an advisory in 2011 and D-Link has fixed this issue:
http://en.securitylab.ru/lab/PT-2011-30
With the current version of the firmware the passwords are stored again in plaintext.

If you combine the plaintext credential vulnerability with the unauthenticated os command injection vulnerability you will get the following one liner to extract the admin password from every vulnerable device:

root@bt:~# curl --data "cmd=cat /var/passwd" http://<Target IP>/command.php
"admin" "THESECRETPASS" "0"
root@bt:~#

    * Information Disclosure:

Detailed device information including Model Name, Hardware Version, Linux Kernel, Firmware version, Language and MAC Addresses are available via the network.

    * Stored XSS via WLAN Assistent and Version Details

Injecting scripts into the parameter SSID reveals that this parameter is not properly validated for malicious input.

=> Parameter: SSID

The injected code gets executed if you try to access the file version.txt. For this you do not need to be authenticated :)
