Introduction:
=============
The FortiMail family of appliances is a proven, powerful messaging security platform for any size organization,
from small businesses to carriers, service providers, and large enterprises. Purpose-built for the most demanding
messaging systems, the FortiMail appliances utilize Fortinetâ€™s years of experience in protecting networks against
spam, malware, and other message-borne threats.

You can prevent your messaging system from becoming a threat delivery system with FortiMail. Its inbound filtering
engine blocks spam and malware before it can clog your network and affect users. Its outbound inspection technology prevents
outbound spam or malware (including 3G mobile traffic) from causing other antispam gateways to blacklist your users.

Three deployment modes offer maximum versatility while minimizing infrastructure changes or service disruptions:
transparent mode for seamless integration into existing networks with no changes to your existing mail server,
gateway mode as a proxy MTA for existing messaging gateways, or full messaging server functionality for remote locations.
FortiMail provides Identity-Based Encryption (IBE), in addition to S/MIME and TLS, as email encryption option to enforce
policy-based encryption for secure content delivery. Furthermore, the FortiMail customizable and predefined dictionaries
prevent accidental or intentional loss of confidential and regulated data.

High


Details:
========
An exception-handling and input filter bypass vulnerability is detected in the Fortinets FortiMail IBE Appliance Application 200D,400C, VM2K, 2000B and 5002B.

The first vulnerability is located in the parse module with the bound vulnerable exception-handling and vulnerable effect on all input fields.
The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the input parse routine by an implement of 2 close tags, which results in the
execution of the secound injected script code with a space between.

The secound vulnerability is located in the import/upload certificate module with the bound vulnerable certificate name and information parameters.
An attacker can implement own certificates with script code in the malicious name and information values. After the upload the persistent code get
executed out of the certificate listing main module.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows to hijack admin/customer sessions, can lead to information disclosure or result in stable
manipulation of web context (persistent & non-persistent).

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Invalid - Exception Handling

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] ipmask
				[+] username
				[+] address
				[+] url


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The exception handling and filter bypass vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers and local low privileged user account.
For demonstration or reproduce ...


Module:		IPAddressMask - ext-mb-text, ext-gen4185 & ext-gen7196
INJECT: 	https://127.0.0.1:1338/admin/FEAdmin.html#SysInterfaceCollection

<div id="ext-gen4183"><div id="ext-gen4184" class="ext-mb-icon  ext-mb-error"></div><div id="ext-gen7197"
class="ext-mb-content"><span id="ext-gen4185" class="ext-mb-

text">Error:IPAddressMask( 2 ) , IPAddressMask.cpp:14,  "Invalid mask:"
><iframe id="ext-gen7196" [PERSISTENT INJECTED SCRIPT CODE!];)" <="" "=""><[PERSISTENT

INJECTED SCRIPT CODE!]") <"><[PERSISTENT INJECTED SCRIPT CODE!]") </0"</iframe></span>

AFFECTED:	https://127.0.0.1:1338/admin/FEAdmin.html#SysInterfaceCollection


Module:		Whitelist & Blacklist - Address
URL:		https://server:1443/admin/FEAdmin.html#PersonalBlackWhiteList

<div id="ext-gen10562" class="ext-mb-content"><span id="ext-gen5714" class="ext-mb-text">
Invalid address: "><[PERSISTENT INJECTED SCRIPT CODE!];)" <="" -=""

"=""><[PERSISTENT INJECTED SCRIPT CODE!]") <</iframe></span>

AFFECTED:	https://server:1443/admin/FEAdmin.html#SystemBlackWhiteList


Module:		Bounce Verification - Username
URL:		https://server:1443/admin/FEAdmin.html#AsBounceverifyKeyCollection

<div id="ext-gen7197" class="ext-mb-content"><span id="ext-gen4185" class="ext-mb-text">

CODE!];)" <="" "=""><[PERSISTENT INJECTED SCRIPT CODE!]") <"</iframe></span>



1.2
The persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with privileged application account and
low required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...


Module:		Upload or Import - Local Certificate - Certificate name

Solution:
=========
1.1
The exception-handling vulnerability can be fixed by parsing the full content without excluding after a close tag. Restrict the input fields to allowed chars.

1.2
The persistent vulnerability in the certificate import/upload module can be patched by parsing the certificate name and info input field.
Do not forget to parse also the vulnerable output listing of the certificate name and cert information.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the of the exception-handling and input filter bypass vulnerability is estimated as high(-).
