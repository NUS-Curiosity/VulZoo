Backdoor was found in a Denver SHO-110 IP Camera. Maybe other models also have this backdoor too.

So, the backdoor located in the camera's second http service, allows the attacker to get a snapshot through `/snapshot` endpoint. There are two http services in camera: first - served on port 80, and it requires authentication, and the second - served on port 8001, and it does not require authentication.

It's possible to write a script that will collect snapshots and add them to each other, so the attacker will be able to disclosure the camera stream.
