Abstract:
=========
he Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered a persistent Vulnerabilities in TP Link gateway v 3.12.4.


Report-Timeline:
================
2012-06-15:	Public or Non-Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple persistent web vulnerabilities is detected in TP Link Gateway v3.12.4 Router Application.
The bugs allow remote attackers to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent).
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to stable (persistent) context manipulation. Exploitation
requires high user inter action & a low privileged user account.

The persistent vulnerabilities are located in the add function of multiple main modules like access control
and the wireless mac filter. The main problem is the validation of the add module -  rule name, host description,
target description & mac filter description. The bug affects the later listings were the persistent code get executed
out of the application context.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Access Control -> Rule -> Add new
				[+] Access Control -> Host -> Add Host
				[+] Access Control -> Target -> Add new
				[+] Wireless -> Wireless MAC Filtering -> Add new

Vulnerable Paramater(s):
				[+] [Rule Name]
				[+] [Target Description]
				[+] [Host Description]
				[+] [Description]

Vulnerable Version(s):
				[+] Firmware Version: 3.12.4 Build 100910 Rel.57694n


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent input validation vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged
user account & required user inter action. For demonstration or reproduce ...

To reproduce the vulnerability or inject malicious script code you only need to change the
standard input field content to the your own script code tags with html or javascript.
The persistent script code get executed out of the listing application context.


Review: Wireless Mac Filter - Listing

Review: Access Control - Add HOST Target - Listing

<html><head><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
var access_targets_data_param = new Array(
1, "<h1>test</h1>", "192.168.1.1/53 - 1221/UDP", "",
0,0 );
</script>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
var access_targets_page_param = new Array(
1, 0, 1, 4, 1,
0,0 );
</script>

... or as description

<html><head><script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
var hosts_lists_data_param = new Array(
1, "<h1>Description</h1>", "192.168.1.115", "192.168.1.126", "",
1, "<script>alert(1)</script", "192.168.1.11", "192.168.1.126", "",
0,0 );
</script>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
var hosts_lists_page_param = new Array(
1, 0, 2, 5, 2,
0,0 );
</script>

Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities is estiamted as medium(-).
