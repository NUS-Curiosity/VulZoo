Avaya IP Office version 11.0.0.0 and before has a vulnerable login page (username) which is susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) via a POST request due to improper sanitization of user input. XSS via a post request allows for arbitrary code to be executed on the clientâ€™s system in the security context of the browser. By submitting a specially crafted username, it is possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
