# Exploit summary
Dbltek GoIP-1 is a VoIP-GSM gateway device, which allows making calls and sending SMS messages using SIP.
The device has a webserver that contains two pre-auth Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities.

Using these, it is possible to download the device configuration file containing all device credentials (including admin panel credentials and SIP credentials) if the configuration file has been backed up.

It is probable that also other models and versions of Dbltek GoIP devices are affected.
