COMMAX Smart Home IoT Control System CDP-1020n SQL Injection Authentication Bypass


Vendor: COMMAX Co., Ltd.
Prodcut web page: https://www.commax.com
Affected version: CDP-1020n
                  481 System

Summary: COMMAX Smart Home System is a smart IoT home solution for a large apartment
complex that provides advanced life values and safety.

Desc: The application suffers from an SQL Injection vulnerability. Input passed
through the 'id' POST parameter in 'loginstart.asp' is not properly sanitised
before being returned to the user or used in SQL queries. This can be exploited
to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code and bypass the authentication
mechanism.

Tested on: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
           ASP.NET
