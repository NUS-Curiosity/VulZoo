Desc: The device allows access to an unprotected endpoint that
allows MPFS File System binary image upload without authentication.
The MPFS2 file system module provides a light-weight read-only
file system that can be stored in external EEPROM, external
serial Flash, or internal Flash program memory. This file system
serves as the basis for the HTTP2 web server module, but is also
used by the SNMP module and is available to other applications
that require basic read-only storage capabilities. This can be
exploited to overwrite the flash program memory that holds the
web server's main interfaces and execute arbitrary code.
