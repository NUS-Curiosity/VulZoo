# TP-Link TP-SG105E 1.0.0 - Unauthenticated Remote Reboot
# The TP-Link TP-SG105E is a "5-Port Gigabit Easy Smart Switch".
# It features a web front end and an application (Easy Smart Configuration Utility)
# for easy configuration management.

# The device does not properly restrict access to an internal API.
# It is therefore possible to remotely reboot the device by sending a HTTP POST
# request.
