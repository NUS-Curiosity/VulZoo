Details.
QNAP provide NAS technology solutions to consumers and enterprises.
Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in the web management
interface.

1. Command Injection:
The QNAP Download Station (QDownload) is vulnerable to command injection
as the application executes user-controllable data that is processed by
a shell command interpreter.

The following resources, accessible post authentication are affected:
/cgi-bin/Qdownload/DS_RSS_Option.cgi [keyword parameter]
/cgi-bin/Qdownload/DS_RSS_Option.cgi [title parameter]
Commands are executed with the context of the admin user [uid=0(admin)
gid=0(administrators] on the QNAP device.

Proof of Concept.
/cgi-bin/Qdownload/DS_RSS_Option.cgi?_dc=1331164660690&url=http%3A%2F%2F
google.com&title=test&keyword=`touch%20%2ftesto%2etxt`&todo=add&sid=i9
nonapr&ver=2.0

2. Cryptography:
The QNAP login page stores persistent cookies (including the administrator
username and password) as base64 encoded strings inside the cookie
parameter nas_p. These cookies are not protected with either the HTTPOnly
or Secure flags allowing theft via one of the many cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities which exist within the application (disclosed previously
by another researcher, but never fixed).

Proof of Concept.
Cookie: qnap_admin_style=default; nas_save_u=1; nas_u=bGFicw==;
nas_address=10.1.1.2; nas_save_p=1; nas_p= YWRtaW5UMG1iJTI0dDBuMw==;
nas_tree_x=240; nas_tree_y=370
YWRtaW5UMG1iJTI0dDBuMw== decodes to admin123qweasd

Solution.
No vendor solution.
