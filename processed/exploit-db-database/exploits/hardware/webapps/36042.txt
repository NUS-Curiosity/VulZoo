Vulnerability description:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
No authentication (login) is required to exploit this vulnerability.
The LG DVR application is prone to a remote file disclosure vulnerability.
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve stored files on server such as '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow' by using a simple url request which made by browser.
More over, an attacker may be able to compromise encrypted login credentials for or retrieve the device's administrator password allowing them to directly access the device's configuration control panel.

The following simple url request will retrieve '/etc/shadow' file:
http://127.0.0.1:1234/etc/shadow
