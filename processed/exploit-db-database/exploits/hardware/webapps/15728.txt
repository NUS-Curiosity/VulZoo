CVE: CVE-2010-4507

Finding:
These devices are susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
An attacker that is able to coerce a ClearSpot / iSpot user into
following a link can arbitrarily execute system commands on the device.

The following examples will allow an attacker to enable remote access to
the
iSpot and ClearSpot 4G, and add their own account to the device. This level
of access also provides a device's client-side SSL certificates, which are
used to perform device authentication. This could lead to a compromise of
ClearWire accounts as well as other personal information.
