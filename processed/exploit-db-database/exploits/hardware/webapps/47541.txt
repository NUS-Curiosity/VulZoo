# An issue was discovered in AUO SunVeillance Monitoring System.
# There is an incorrect access control vulnerability that can allow the attacker to
# bypass the authentication mechanism, and upload files to the server without any authentication.

# 2. Proof of Concept:
(1) Access the picture management page of AUO SunVeillance Monitoring System (/Solar_Web_Portal/Picture_Manage_mvc.aspx) without
    any authentication. As a guest role, user is not allowed to upload a picture. However, there are two parameters, Act and authority, in Picture_Manage_mvc.aspx.
(2) Modify the value of parameter authority from 40 to 100. You can find out the upload button is enabled.
(3) Now you can upload a file successfully.
(4) The file which we uploaded is storing in server side. Itâ€™s means any user without authentication can upload files to server side.

Thank you for your kind assistance.
