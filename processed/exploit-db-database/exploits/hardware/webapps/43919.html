# Vendor Homepage: http://www.netis-systems.com/
# Version: Netis-WF2419, V2.2.36123
# Tested on: Windows 10
#Technical Details & Description:

A cross-site request forgery web vulnerability has been discovered in the
official Netis-WF2419 Router.

The vulnerability allows remote attackers to manipulate client-side
web-application to browser requests to compromise the router
by execution of system specific functions without session protection.

A remote attacker is able to delete Address Reservation List settings of
Netis Router with a cross-site request forgery html script code.

The vulnerability can be exploited by loading embedded html code in a site
or page. The issue can also be exploited by attackers to external redirect
an user account
to malicious web pages.
 The issue requires medium user interaction in case of exploitation. The
request method to execute is GET and the attack vector is located on the
client-side of the router firmware.

Exploitation of the cross site request forgery web vulnerability requires
no privilege web application user account and medium or high user
interaction.
Successful exploitation results in client-side account theft by client-side
phishing, client-side external redirects and non-persistent manipulation of
application functions that are in use.

The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged
application user account and with medium or high user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the
provided information and steps below to continue.

#Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability :
