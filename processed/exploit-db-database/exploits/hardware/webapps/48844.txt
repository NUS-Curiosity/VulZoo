SpinetiX Fusion Digital Signage 3.4.8 File Backup/Delete Path Traversal


Vendor: SpinetiX AG
Product web page: https://www.spinetix.com
Affected version: <= 3.4.8 (1.0.36274)

Summary: At SpinetiX we inspire businesses to unlock the potential of their story.
We believe in the power of digital signage as a dynamic new storytelling platform
to engage with people. For more than 13 years, we have been constantly innovating
to deliver cutting-edge digital signage solutions that help our customers shine.
Fusion is a built-in content management application accessible from a standard web
browser - it is pre-installed on every HMP200, HMP130, and HMP100 device, and does
not require any additional license, cost, or software installation.

Desc: The application suffers from an authenticated path traversal vulnerability.
Input passed via several parameters in index.php script is not properly verified
before being used to create and delete files. This can be exploited to write backup
files to an arbitrary location and/or delete arbitrary files via traversal attacks.

Tested on: Apache 2.2.34
           PHP/5.3.18-2
           Linux 2.6.10
