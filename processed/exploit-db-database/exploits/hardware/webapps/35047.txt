Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A persistent mail encoding web vulnerability has been discovered in the official DELL SonicWall GMS v7.2.x appliance web-application.
The security issue allows remote attackers with low privileged user account to inject own malicious script codes to the application-side
of the vulnerable service module.

The vulnerability is located in the `Console > Management > Settings > GMS Settings` module. Remote attackers and low privileged web-application
user accounts are able to inject own malicious script code context as notification value. The vulnerable user context with log files or information
notification messages (input) will be send to the internal web-server through the firewall. The data of the POST method request in the input, executes
without a secure encoding or a restriction on the input in the web-application appliance. The persistent execution of the script code occurs in the mail
notification that gets send by the appliances directly to users or via the interval count. In case of the second provided scenario the application generated
a pdf report with malicious script code in the mail body message.

The issue impact a risk to the full appliance web-application get compromised beause the send mail notifications is wrong encoded and the internal encode is
broken too. Regular the stored values must be secure encoded and parsed to prevent persistent executions in the appliance mails. The attack vector is persistent
on the application-side of the vulnerable service and the request method to inject the payload is POST.

The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0.
Exploitation of the vulnerability requires a low privileged application user account and low user interaction. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results
in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent external redirect via mail and persistent manipulation of affected or connected module context.


Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Console > Management > Settings > GMS Settings

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] message body > table

Affected Service(s):
				[+] admin@sonicwall.com (test > livedemo-admin@sonicwall.com)


Note: All other modules sending user values of non restricted input throught the appliance back. (logs, updates ...)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent mail encoding web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low privileged application user account and low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

Information of requirements:
- The template to send notification alerts needs to be send to the
Default html (example: http://gms.demo.sonicwall.com/sgms/auth > )
- The Console > Management > Settings section needs to be linked to the
appliance demo email address (example: livedemo-admin@sonicwall.com)
- The Alert of the notification with the pdf summery report of the
archiv needs to be redirected to the testmail like in our case
(bkm@evolution-sec.com)

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure encode and parse of the input values in the message body context
Filter and restrict context of send mails through the application and the web-server of the sonicwall gms appliance.
The issue has already been patched by the dell security team in cooperation with the vulnerability-lab during the year 2014.


Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent mail encoding and validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium. (CVSS 3.0)
