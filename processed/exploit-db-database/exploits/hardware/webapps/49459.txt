Summary: IP camera with optical character recognition (OCR) software for automatic
number plate recognition (ANPR) also equipped with ADR system that enables it to read
the Hazard Identification Number (HIN, also known as the Kemler Code) and UN number
of any vehicle captured in free-flow mode. TARGA is fully accurate in reading number
plates of vehicles travelling at high speed. Its varifocal, wide-angle lens makes
this camera suitable for all installation conditions. Its built-in OCR software works
as an automatic and independent system without the need of a computer, thus giving
autonomy to the device even in the event of an interruption in the connection between
the camera and the operations centre.

Desc: The ANPR camera suffers from an unauthenticated and unauthorized live stream
disclosure when p1.mjpg or p1.264 is called.
