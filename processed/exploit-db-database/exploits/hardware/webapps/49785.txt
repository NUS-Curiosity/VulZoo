--Details--

The AdTran Personal Phone Manager software is vulnerable to an authenticated stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issues. These issues impact at minimum versions 10.8.1 and below but potentially impact later versions as well since they have not previously been disclosed. Only version 10.8.1 was able to be confirmed during primary research. These issues work by passing in a basic XSS payload to vulnerable POST parameters that are rendered in the output without saniztization. Since the forms do require authentication to access these issues cannot be exploited without credentials. This can allow for several issues including but not limited to:

- Hijacking another user's session
- Modifying a user's configuration settings
- Using XSS payloads to capture input (keylogging)

-- Proof of Concept --
The following form was impacted and can be exploited with the sample payloads provided below:
- https://example.com/userapp/userSettingsAction.html
	- POST
		- 	formAction=changeEmailAddress&emailAddress=+data%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%`document.cookie`60%3C%2Fscript%3E+&emailAddress2=&emailApply=Apply+Changes

The vulnerable parameters that were identified are:
- emailAddress
- emailAddress2

--Mitigation--

Sanitize any user controlled input in both form fields and URL paramaters to properly encode data so it is not rendered as arbitrary HTML/JavaScript.
