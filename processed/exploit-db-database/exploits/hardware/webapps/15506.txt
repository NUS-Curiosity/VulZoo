Finding 3: Web Based Administration Interface Bypass
CVE: CVE-2010-4232

The CMNC-200 IP Camera has an administrative web
interface that does not handle authentication properly.
Using a properly formatted request, an attacker can bypass
the authentication mechanism.

The first example requires authentication:
http://www.ipcamera.com/system.html

When a second forward slash is placed after the hostname,
authentication is not required.
http://www.ipcamera.com//system.html

This vulnerability allows an attacker to take full control of
the IP Camera.

Vendor Response:
No response received.

Remediation Steps:
No patch currently exists for this issue. To limit exposure,
network access to these devices should be limited to authorized
personnel through the use of Access Control Lists and proper
network segmentation.
