# I'm trying my TV.I saw a Grundig remote control application on
# Google Play. Computer I downloaded and decompiled APK.
# And I began to examine individual classes. I noticed in a class
# that a request was sent during operations on the command line.
# I downloaded the phone packet viewer and opened the control application and
# made some operations. And I saw that there was such a request;

# PoC

request ->

# Set rc key is handled for key id : -2544 key symbol : -4081
# The only requirement for the connection between the TV and the application
# was to have the same IP address. After I made the IP address on the TV
# and the phone and the IP address on the computer the same:
# I accessed the interface from the 8085 port. Now I could do anything from the computer :)
