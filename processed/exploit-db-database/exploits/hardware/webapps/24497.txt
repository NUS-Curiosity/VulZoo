Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the mobile Transferable Remote v1.01 app for the apple ipad & iphone.


Report-Timeline:
================

Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Apple AppStore
Product: Transferable Remote 1.01


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
A local file include web vulnerability via POST request method is detected in the mobile Transferable Remote v1.01 app for the apple ipad & iphone.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers via POST method to inject local app webserver folders to request unauthorized local webserver files.

The vulnerbility is located in the downloadPhoto module of the webserver (http://192.168.0.10:80) when processing to load a manipulated
`assets-library` url parameter. The execution of the injected path or file request will occur when the attacker is processing to reload
to index listing of the affected module.

Exploitation of the web vulnerability does not require a privileged application user account (standard) or user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized path or file access via local file or path include attack.


Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] Transferable Remote v1.0 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] downloadPhoto

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] assets-library

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index Listing



1.2
A local command injection web vulnerability is detected in the mobile Transferable Remote v1.01 app for the apple ipad & iphone.
The vulnerability allows to inject local commands via vulnerable system values to compromise the apple mobile application.

The vulnerbility is located in the index module when processing to load the ipad or iphone device name. Local attackers can change the
ipad or iphone device name to system specific commands and file/path requests to provoke the execution when processing to watch the index listing.

Exploitation of the web vulnerability does not require a privileged application user account (standard) or user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results unauthorized execution of system specific commands and path requests.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] Transferable Remote v1.0 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Index

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] device name - iPad or iPone

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index Listing (Device Name)




1.3
A persistent input validation vulnerability is detected in the mobile Transferable Remote v1.01 app for the apple ipad & iphone.
The bug allows an attacker (remote) to implement/inject malicious script code on the application side (persistent) of the app web service.

The vulnerability is located in the downloadCollection module of the webserver (http://192.168.0.10:80) when processing to request
via POST manipulated name, ext and url parameters. The persistent script code will be executed out of the downloadcollection module listing.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires low or medium user interaction and with low or medium privileged application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to persistent session hijacking (customers), account steal via persistent web
attacks, persistent phishing or stable (persistent) certificate mail notification context manipulation.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] Transferable Remote v1.0 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] downloadCollection

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] url & ext

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Index Listing (Device Name)



1.4
A non-persistent cross site scripting vulnerability is detected  in the mobile Transferable Remote v1.01 app for the apple ipad & iphone.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to form manipulated request to hijack employeerss, moderator or admin sessions via client side
browser attack.

The vulnerability is located in the appliance invalid Exception Handling module and the not secure parsed path & id variables.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in account steal via client side session hijacking, client site phishing, or
client-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] Transferable Remote v1.0 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Index

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] page and bound id

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Exception Handling (Error) Listing


Proof of Concept:

The client side cross site scripting web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker without privileged application user account and
with medium or high required user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Client Side Cross Site Scripting - Exception Handling

PoC:
http://137.168.0.10:15555/0/-x[CLIENT SIDE INJECTED SCRIPT CODE! XSS]

Manually steps to reproduce ...

1. Install the service application on your mobile ipad or iphone device
2. Start the software and open http://192.168.0.10:15555/
3. Include the following path `0/-1` to provoke the an invalid application error (Example: http://137.168.0.10:15555/0/-1)
4. The -1 will be displayed with the path in a script bound to the invalid value exception
5. Now, the attacker can include his script code and request the same script via GET again
6. The script will be executed on client side in the browser when processing to load the manipulated link
7. Successful reproduce ... done!
