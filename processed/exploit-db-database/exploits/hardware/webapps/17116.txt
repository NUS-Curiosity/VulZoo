[+] Vulnerabilities

Stored Cross-site Scripting:
Web interface from PS110, PS101-A and PS112 Print Servers are affected by stored
cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize
user-supplied input at "NDSContext" field in "NetWare NDS Settings" area.
An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code
in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site.

After injecting the XSS code, you need to access Netware status page.
