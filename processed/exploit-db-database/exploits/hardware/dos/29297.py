-HP Printers running FTP Print Server are prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability. This issue occurs because the application fails to boundscheck user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial of service.
