The Lucent Access Point series of routers support a web based administrative interface. An error has been reported in the embedded HTTP server.

It has been reported that sending a HTTP request consisting of approximately 4000 characters of data will cause the device to reboot. This may result in an interruption of service for legitimate users of the device.

wget `perl -e 'print "http://router_ip/"; print "A"x4000; print "/";`
