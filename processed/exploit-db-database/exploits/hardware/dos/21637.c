ZyXEL 642R and Prestige 310 routers have difficulties handling IP packets that are malformed. Reportedly, when ZyXEL routers receive a single specially malformed packet, they stop responding for exactly 30 seconds.

ZyXEL 642R and Prestige 310 routers are reportedly affected by this vulnerability. It is possible that other ZyNOS-based routers are also affected by this vulnerability

/* Jolt 1.0 (c) 1997 by Jeff w. Roberson
 * Please, if you use my code give me credit.  Also, if i was the first to
 * find this glitch, please give me credit.  Thats all i ask.
 *
 * Ok so all this does is build a really fraggmented over sized packet
 * and once win95 gets it, and puts it back together it locks.  I send
 * multiple packets by default cause some times it takes a few packets to
 * totally freeze the host.  Maybe its spending processor time to figure
 * out how to put them back together?  I've had reports of people blue
 * screening from it tho so we'll let Microsoft's boys figure out exactly
 * what this does to 95.  As of now i haven't tested it on NT, but maybe
 * i will later ;).  All of this source wasn't origonally written by me
 * I just took one of the old programs to kill POSIX and SYSV based
 * systems and worked on it abit, then made it spoof =).

 *
 *  Update: It apears to work on some older versions of mac os
