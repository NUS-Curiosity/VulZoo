Netgear VPN router SSL312 is proune to a remote DoS condition which can get
triggered if somebody has access to the webinterface of the VPN router.
The problem is related to a propietary CGI binary and makes is impossible
for users to patch the router. Further in detail analyses will show several
other issues like outdated third party software (e.g. the webserver) and further
problems in the cgi-binary itself which won't get disclosed here.

If you download the source code the affected binary can be found at:
./NG_SSL312-GPL/uClinux/uC-src/real/EasyAccess/EasyAccess/www/cgi-bin/single_cgi


Steps to reproduce:

Visit the Netgear SSL312 VPN router webinterface.
You will see a login field and a password field.
Just enter any random data and proceed.

The URL will include a path like:
https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/cgi-bin/welcome/VPN_only?err=VXNlciBMb2dpbiBGYWlsZWQ=

If you modify the URL as below and resend your http request the device will
crash and needs a hard reboot.

https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/cgi-bin/welcome/VPN_only?../../../../../

Example network affected by this: StudiVZ

Simple google dork:
intitle:SSL-VPN intext:password inurl:/cgi-bin/welcome

Workaround:
Preventing others to gain access to the webinterface of the router prevents
the attack.

Kind regards,
Rembrandt
