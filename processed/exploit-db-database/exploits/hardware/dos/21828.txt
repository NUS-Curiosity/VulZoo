When multiple Procurve switches are used interconnected, it is common for an administrator to enable a feature allowing each switch to be viewed through a single interface, accessible via the web.

It has been reported that HP Procurve Switches are vulnerable to a denial of service attack, when used in a "stack" configuration. It is possible for an attacker to reset member switches by issuing a device reset command to a vulnerable device. Vulnerable devices do not require authentication before accepting this command.

It should be noted that the web interface is not enabled by default.
