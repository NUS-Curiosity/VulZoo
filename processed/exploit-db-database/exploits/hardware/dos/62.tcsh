# Remote DoS exploit against the recent Cisco IOS vuln. Cisco doc. 44020
# Vulnerable versions - all Cisco devices running IOS.
# Requirements : tcsh, and hping.
# Get hping @ www.hping.org
#
# And you know the best part? This script actually works! Unlike the few .c's
# floating around the net. Uses swipe for the protocol bit. Also, need to be uid=0,
# OR +s ciscodos.sh because of hping opening raw sockets.
#
# Example :
#
# root@evicted # ping 192.168.1.1
# PING 192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1): 56 data bytes
# 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=150 time=1.287 ms
# 64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=150 time=0.817 ms
# --- 192.168.1.1 ping statistics ---
# 2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
# round-trip min/avg/max/std-dev = 0.817/1.052/1.287/0.235 ms
