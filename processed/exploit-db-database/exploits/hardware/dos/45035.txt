Summary: The new IPn4Gb provides a rugged, industrial strength wireless solution
using the new and ultra fast 4G LTE cellular network infrastructure. The IPn4Gb
features integrated Firewall, IPSec / VPN & GRE Tunneling, IP/MAC Access Control
Lists. The IPn4Gb can transport critical data to and from SMS, Ethernet and Serial
RS232/485/422 devices!

The IPn3Gb provides a fast, secure industrial strength wireless solution that uses
the widespread deployment of cellular network infrastructure for critical data collection.
From remote meters and sensors, to providing mobile network access, the IPn3Gb delivers!
The IPn3Gb is a powerful HSPA+ and Quad Band GSM device compatible almost anywhere. It
provides robust and secure wireless communication of Serial, USB and Ethernet data.

The all new Bullet-3G provides a compact, robust, feature packed industrial strength
wireless solution using fast 3G/HSPA+ network infrastructure. The Bullet-3G takes things
to the next level by providing features such as Ethernet with PoE, RS232 Serial port
and 2x Programmable I/O. Offering enhanced, 'Secure Communication' with its integrated
Firewall, IPSec VPN Tunneling, IP/MAC Access Control Lists, the Bullet-3G is a solution
worth looking at!

The all new Dragon-LTE provides a feature packed, compact OEM, industrial strength
wireless IoT & M2M solution. Connect any device, wired or wireless, and provide remote
cellular access using the Dragon-LTE. The Dragon-LTE features a OEM design for tight
system integration and design flexibility with dual Ethernet Ports and high power
802.11b/g/n WIFI. With its integrated Firewall, IPSec VPN Tunneling and IP/MAC Access
Control Lists, the Dragon-LTE provides a solution for any cellular application!

The new VIP4Gb provides a rugged, industrial strength wireless solution using 4G LTE
network infrastructure for critical data communications. The VIP4Gb provides simultaneous
network connections for 802.11a/b/g/n WiFi devices, 4 x 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports, Digital
I/O, and a RS232/RS485 port, resulting in a communication device that can be deployed in
any application! The VIP4Gb is a powerful 4G LTE device compatible on any cellular network.
It provides robust and secure wireless communication of Serial, Ethernet & WiFi data.

Desc: There is an undocumented and hidden feature that allows an authenticated attacker
to list running processes in the operating system and send arbitrary signals to kill
any process running in the background including starting and stopping system services.
This impacts availability and can be triggered also by CSRF attacks that requires device
restart and/or factory reset to rollback malicious changes.

Tested on: httpd-ssl-1.0.0
           Linux 2.6.32.9 (Bin@DProBuilder) (gcc version 4.4.3)
