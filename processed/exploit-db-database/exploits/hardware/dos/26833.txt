Multiple unspecified Cisco Catalyst switches are prone to a denial of service vulnerability.

These devices are susceptible to a remote denial of service vulnerability when handling TCP 'LanD' packets.

This issue allows remote attackers to crash affected devices, or to temporarily block further network routing functionality. This will deny further network services to legitimate users.

As no specific Cisco devices were identified by the reporter of this issue, all Cisco Catalyst devices have been marked as vulnerable. This BID will be updated as further information on affected packages is available.
