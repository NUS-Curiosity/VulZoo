A denial of service vulnerability has been reported for several networking devices.

The condition will be triggered when the embedded web server, used by the devices, receives an overly long HTTP header. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the device to stop functioning.

Rebooting the device is necessary to restore functionality.

Although not yet confirmed, it has been speculated that this issue is a result of a buffer overflow.
