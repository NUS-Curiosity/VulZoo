Affected version: img:v9.7.1 Html:v2.4 RS485:v2.5

Summary: The transmitter Blue Plus is designed with all
the latest technologies, such as high efficiency using
the latest generation LDMOS transistor and high efficiency
power supplies. We used a modern interface and performance
using a color display with touch screen, with easy management
software and easy to use. The transmitter is equipped with
all audio input including Audio IP for a complete audio
interface. The VHF/FM transmitter 30-1000 is intended
for the transmission of frequency modulated broadcasts
in mono or stereo. It work with broadband characteristics
in the VHF frequency range from 87.5-108 MHz and can be
operated with any frequency in this range withoug alignment.
The transmitter output power is variable between 10 and 110%
of the nominal Power. It is available with different remote
control ports. It can store up to six broadcast programs
including program specific parameters such as frequency,
RF output power, modulation type, RDS, AF level and deviation
limiting. The transmitter is equipped with a LAN interface
that permits the complete remote control of the transmitter
operation via SNMP or Web Server.

Desc: The device is suffering from a Denial of Service (DoS)
vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can issue an
unauthorized HTTP GET request to the unprotected endpoint
'doreboot' and restart the transmitter operations.

Tested on: lighttpd/1.4.32
