Packeteer PacketShaper is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because the application's web interface fails to properly handle unexpected requests.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote, authenticated attackers to reboot affected devices, denying service to legitimate users.

PacketShaper 7.3.0g2 and 7.5.0g1 are vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
