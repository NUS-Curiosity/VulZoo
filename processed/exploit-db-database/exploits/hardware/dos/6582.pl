# ----------WM6 remote overflow reboot PoC----------
# Simple exploit for remote rebooting a windows mobile device
# Maybe we can use it for doing command execution,
# I've not test it since the device is rebooting and do not dump a core
# for further analysing.
#
# The bug is not realy in the long string name but when it's the first
# time the wm6 device try to get a connection with too long name.
#
# There's two way to exploit this bug, this PoC show the first method
# (direct connect to the device if we know the bdaddr) but you can
# just wait for the device to search and overflow by itself when
# seeing the hci name:
# hciconfig <hci dev> name `perl -e 'print "A"x90000'`
# hciconfig <hci dev> piscan
# You just have to wait until the wm device search for bluetooth devices
# in range and it will be overflowed
#
#  *Tested on WM6 fully patched  on [HTC wiza 200],[HTC Mda 8125]
