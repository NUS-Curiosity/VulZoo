# Author: b0telh0
# Link: app store (http://itunes.apple.com/br/app/ftp-server/id346724641?mt=8)
# Tested on: iPhone 3G (firmware 3.1.3)


# The server doesn't crash at all, but after exploiting it
# you can't see (list) your files anymore. You must to close the app
# and open it again. Then you'll see that the app starts like it was
# fresh installed and your files are gone.
