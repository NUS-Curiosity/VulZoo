Palm WebOS is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to properly validate user-supplied data.

Attackers can leverage this issue to cause an affected device to reboot. Given the nature of this issue, attackers may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

Palm WebOS 1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
