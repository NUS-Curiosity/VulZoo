SonicWall NSA 4500 is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability and a session-hijacking vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues can allow an attacker to hijack a user's session and gain unauthorized access to the affected application, or run malicious HTML or JavaScript code, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.
