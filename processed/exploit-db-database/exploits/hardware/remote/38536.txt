Barracuda SSL VPN 680 is prone to an open-redirection vulnerability.

An attacker can leverage this issue by constructing a crafted URI and enticing a user to follow it. When an unsuspecting victim follows the link, they may be redirected to an attacker-controlled site; this may aid in phishing attacks. Other attacks are possible.

Barracuda SSL VPN 680 2.2.2.203 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
