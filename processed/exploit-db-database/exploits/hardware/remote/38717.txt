## Advisory Information

Title: DIR-866L Buffer overflows in HNAP and send email functionalities
Vendors contacted: William Brown <william.brown@dlink.com>, Patrick Cline patrick.cline@dlink.com(Dlink)
CVE: None

Note: All these security issues have been discussed with the vendor and vendor indicated that they have fixed issues as per the email communication. The vendor had also released the information on their security advisory pages http://securityadvisories.dlink.com/security/publication.aspx?name=SAP10060,
http://securityadvisories.dlink.com/security/publication.aspx?name=SAP10061

However, the vendor has taken now the security advisory pages down and hence the information needs to be publicly accessible so that users using these devices can update the router firmwares.The author (Samuel Huntley) releasing this finding is not responsible for anyone using this information for malicious purposes.

## Product Description

DIR866L -- AC1750 Wi-Fi Router. Mainly used by home and small offices.

## Vulnerabilities Summary

Have come across 2 security issue in DIR866L firmware which allows an attacker on wireless LAN  to exploit buffer overflow vulnerabilities in hnap and send email functionalities. An attacker needs to be on wireless LAN or management interface needs to be exposed on Internet to exploit HNAP vulnerability but it requires no authentication. The send email buffer overflow does require the attacker to be on wireless LAN or requires to trick administrator to exploit using XSRF.
