====================================================


ZeroShell (http://www.zeroshell.net/eng/) is a small Linux distribution
for servers and embedded devices. This Linux distro can be configured
and managed with an easy to use web console.

ZeroShell is prone to an arbitrary code execution vulnerability due to
an improper input validation mechanism. An aggressor may abuse this
weakness in order to compromise the entire system.
Authentication is not required in order to exploit this flaw.

[Proof of Concept]

/cgi-bin/kerbynet?Section=NoAuthREQ&Action=x509List&type=*%22;<CMD HERE>;%22

In addition to the Unix commands, it is possible to abuse the
ZeroShell scripts themself. For instance it is likely to use the
"getkey" script in order to retrieve remote files, including the content
in the html page.
