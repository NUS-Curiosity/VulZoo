SonicWALL Global VPN Client is prone to a remote format-string vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before passing it as the format specifier to a formatted-printing function.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of the application. Failed attempts may cause denial-of-service conditions.

Global VPN Client 4.0.0.2-51e Standard and Enhanced are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following proofs of concept are available:

1. CFS: Add example.com to your "Forbidden Domains" and access http://www.example.com/%s%s%s%s%s%s/.

2. GroupVPN: Establish a GroupVPN Tunnel and enter at the XAUTH Username %s%s%s%s%s.

3. Webfrontend: Enter at the Login Page of your SonicWALL as Username %s%s%s%s%s
