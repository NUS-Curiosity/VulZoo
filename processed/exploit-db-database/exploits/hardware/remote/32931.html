The Linksys WRT54GC router is prone to an access-validation vulnerability because of a lack of authentication when users access specific administration applications.

Successful attacks will lead to a compromise of the vulnerable device, which may lead to further attacks.

Linksys WRT54GC running firmware 1.05.7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
