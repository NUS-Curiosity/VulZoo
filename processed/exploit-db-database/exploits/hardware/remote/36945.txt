TP-LINK TL-WR740N is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attacker-supplied HTML or script code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

TP-LINK TL-WR740N 111130 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
