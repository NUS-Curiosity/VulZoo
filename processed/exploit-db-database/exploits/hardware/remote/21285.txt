HP AdvanceStack 10Base-T Switching Hubs combine 10Base-T functionality with the performance of switching.

It has been reported that authentication for HP J3210A 10Base-T Switching Hubs may be bypassed by an unprivileged user who accesses one of the administrative web pages directly.

The attacker may allegedly change the superuser password of the device via this interface and gain access to the administrative facilities of the device. Additionally, authentication credentials are disclosed to the attacker.

*Reportedly, the password is stored in plain text and can be revealed by viewing the source of the web page.
