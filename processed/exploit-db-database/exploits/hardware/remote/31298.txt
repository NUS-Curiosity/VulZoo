Packeteer PacketShaper and PolicyCenter are prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because they fail to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
