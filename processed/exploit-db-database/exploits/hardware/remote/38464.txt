1. A security-bypass vulnerability
2. A cross-site request-forgery vulnerability
3. A cross-site scripting vulnerability

An attacker can exploit these issues to bypass certain security restrictions, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, gain access to system and other configuration files, or perform unauthorized actions in the context of a user session.

Cisco Linksys EA2700 running firmware 1.0.12.128947 is vulnerable.
