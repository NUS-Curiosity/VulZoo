ZyXEL P-330W 802.11g Secure Wireless Internet Sharing Router is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and cross-site request-forgery vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. These issues affect the device's web-based administrative interface.

An attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

The attacker may leverage the cross-site request-forgery issues to perform actions in the context of a device administrator, which can compromise the device.
