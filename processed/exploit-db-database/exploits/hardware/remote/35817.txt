NetGear WNDAP350 wireless access point is prone to multiple remote information-disclosure issues because it fails to restrict access to sensitive information.

A remote attacker can exploit these issues to obtain sensitive information that can aid in launching further attacks.

WNDAP350 with firmware 2.0.1 and 2.0.9 are vulnerable; other firmware versions may also be affected.
