IOS is the operating system designed for various Cisco devices. It is maintained and distributed by Cisco systems.

A problem in the versions of IOS 11.x and 12.0 could allow unauthorized access to certain configuration variables within a Cisco device. The ILMI SNMP Community string allows read and write access to system objects in the MIB-II community group. These configuration parameters do not affect the normal operation of the device, although if changed, can cause confusion or lead to a social engineering attack.

It is possible for a malicious remote user to change configuration objects within the MIB-II Community, and rename the system, change the location name in the system, and/or the contact information for the system. This vulnerability affects only certain devices.
