The Proxim Tsunami MP.11 2411 Wireless Access Point is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the web interface of the affected device, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

This issue is reported in the Tsunami MP.11 Model 2411; additional products may also be vulnerable.
