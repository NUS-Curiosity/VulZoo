Edimax AR-6004 ADSL Routers are prone to cross-site scripting attacks via the web management interface of affected devices. An attacker could exploit this issue by enticing a victim user to follow a malicious link to a site hosting the software that contains embedded HTML and script code. The embedded code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user.

This could potentially be exploited to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users. Other attacks are also possible.
