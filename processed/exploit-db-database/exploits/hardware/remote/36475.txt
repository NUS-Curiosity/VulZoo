Barracuda Control Center 620 is prone to an HTML injection vulnerability and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits will allow attacker-supplied HTML and script code to run in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or control how the site is rendered to the user. Other attacks are also possible.
