Cisco DPC2100 (formerly Scientific Atlanta DPC2100) is prone to multiple security-bypass and cross-site request-forgery vulnerabilities.

Successful exploits may allow attackers to run privileged commands on the affected device, change configuration settings, modify device firmware, cause denial-of-service conditions, or inject arbitrary script code. Other attacks are also possible.

Firmware versions prior to 2.0.2.r1256-100324as are vulnerable.
