SonicWALL Content Filtering is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when displaying URI address data in a blocked-site error page.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of an arbitrary site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Versions prior to SonicWALL Content Filtering on SonicOS Enhanced 4.0.1.1 are vulnerable.
