Juniper Networks SA2000 SSL VPN appliance is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the web interface fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Juniper Networks SA2000 running IVE OS 6.5R1 (Build 14599) are vulnerable; other models and versions may also be affected.
