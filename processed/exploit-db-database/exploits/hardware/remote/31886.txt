F5 FirePass SSL VPN is prone to multiple cross-site request-forgery vulnerabilities because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary actions in the context of the affected application.

FirePass 6.0.2 hotfix 3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
