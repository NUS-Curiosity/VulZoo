Cisco Video Surveillance Operations Manager is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities, including:

1. Multiple local file-include vulnerabilities
2. A security-bypass vulnerability
3. Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities

An attacker may leverage these issues to bypass certain security restrictions to perform unauthorized actions, execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, and open or run arbitrary files in the context of the affected application.

Cisco Video Surveillance Operations Manager 6.3.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
