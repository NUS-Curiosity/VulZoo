Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been reported in the FortiGate Firewall web administrative interface.

These issues could be exploited by enticing an administrative user to follow a malicious link that includes hostile HTML and script code as values for URI parameters. If such a link is followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the administrator's browser. This could lead to theft of cookie-based authentication credentials, which contain the username and MD5 hash of the password, allowing for full compromise of the firewall.
