Juniper Networks JUNOS is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and HTML-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data to J-Web (Juniper Web Management).

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

This issue affects the following:

J-Web 8.5R1.14
J-Web 9.0R1.1
