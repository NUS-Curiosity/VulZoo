Axis M10 Series Network Cameras are prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because they fail to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Axis M1054 firmware 5.21 is vulnerable; other version may also be affected.
