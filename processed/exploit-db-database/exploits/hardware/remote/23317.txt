It has been reported that FlexWATCH Network Video Server may be prone to an access validation error that may allow a remote attacker to gain administrative access to the system. The problem is reported to present itself when an attacker attempts to access the administrative interface using a specially crafted URL containing two slash '/' characters.

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow a remote attacker to gain administrator level privileges to the server. This may lead to user accounts and system configuration modifications.

FlexWATCH Network Video Server Model 132 has been reported to be prone to this issue, however other versions may be affected as well.
