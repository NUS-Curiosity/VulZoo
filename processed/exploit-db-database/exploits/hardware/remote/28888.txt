ECI Telecom's B-FOCuS ADSL2+ Combo332+ wireless router is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability. The router's Web-Based Management interface fails to authenticate users before providing access to sensitive information.

Exploiting this issue may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the affected device, which may aid in further attacks.
