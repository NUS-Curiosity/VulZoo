The Cisco 871 Integrated Services Router is prone to a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability.

Successful exploits can run arbitrary commands on affected devices. This may lead to further network-based attacks.

The 871 Integrated Services Router under IOS 12.4 is vulnerable; other products and versions may also be affected.
