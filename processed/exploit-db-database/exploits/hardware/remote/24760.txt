ZyXEL Prestige router series is reported prone to an access validation vulnerability. The vulnerability exists because the firmware of the router fails to restrict access to a configuration page that is a part of the ZyXEL Prestige HTTP based remote administration service.

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to reset the configuration of the router.
