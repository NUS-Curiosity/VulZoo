Linksys SPA941 devices are prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because the built-in webserver fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would execute in the context of the affected website, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Linksys SPA941 devices with firmware version 5.1.8 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
