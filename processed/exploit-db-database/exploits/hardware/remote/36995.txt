FirePass is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

The following versions of FirePass are affected:
6.0
6.0.1
6.0.2
6.0.2.3
6.0.3
6.1
7.0
