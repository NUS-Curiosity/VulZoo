CiscoWorks Common Services is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks on unsuspecting users in the context of the affected website. As a result, the attacker may be able to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

This issue is being monitored by Cisco Bug ID CSCto12704.

CiscoWorks Common Services 3.3 and prior are vulnerable.
