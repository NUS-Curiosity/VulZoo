Linksys Wireless-G ADSL Gateway is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers may exploit this issue by enticing victims into opening a malicious URI.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected device. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials, cause denial-of-service conditions, and launch other attacks.

Successful exploits will allow script code to be stored persistently in the affected device.

Linksys Wireless-G ADSL Gateway WAG54GS running firmware V1.00.06 is reported vulnerable.
