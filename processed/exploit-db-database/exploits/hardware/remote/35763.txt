Cisco Unified Operations Manager is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. Other attacks may also be possible.

This issue is being tracked by Cisco Bug ID CSCtn61716.

Cisco Unified Operations Manager versions prior to 8.6 are vulnerable.
