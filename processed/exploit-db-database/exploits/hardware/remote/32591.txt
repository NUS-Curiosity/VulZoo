3Com Wireless 8760 Dual-Radio 11a/b/g PoE Access Point is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities, including an HTML-injection issue and an authentication-bypass issue.

Successfully exploiting these issues will allow an attacker to obtain administrative credentials, bypass security mechanisms, or run attacker-supplied HTML and script code in the context of the web administration interface. The attacker may then be able to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.
