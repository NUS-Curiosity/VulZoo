Xpient Cash Drawer Operation Vulnerability


1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Xpient Cash Drawer Operation Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-0517
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/xpient-cash-drawer-operation-vulnerability
Date published: 2013-06-05
Date of last update: 2013-06-05
Vendors contacted: XPIENT Solutions
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Input validation error [CWE-20]
Impact: Security bypass
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2013-2571


3. *Vulnerability Description*

A security vulnerability was found in Xpient POS system running an
instance of Iris 3.8 software [1]; the POS cash drawer could be remotely
triggered to open if a malicious agent has access to the POS network and
is allowed to send a crafted message to the POS terminal hosting the
cash drawer. The malicious agent could be malware which operates from
any device on the POS network or an unauthorized device connected to the
physical POS network.

No Authentication or encryption layer is required to exploit this
vulnerability. As a result, the cash drawer opens and its content is
physically accessible.


4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . Iris 3.8 build 1052.
   . Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


5. *Non-Vulnerable Packages*

   . Iris 3.8 build 1548 or higher.


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Xpient notifies that this vulnerability has been corrected in IRIS v3.8
build 1548, notified their active customers of this concern and provided
them with guidance. Security Bulletin XS130521, May 21st 2013.

Enabling a software firewall (e.g. Windows Firewall) on the POS Terminal
to deny incoming traffic from reaching the cash drawer functions on the
terminal will also prevent remote attacks.

For further information contact vendor via the official email address
for product security inquiries which is: padss [at] xpient [dot] com.


7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Matthew Bergin from
Core Security Technologies.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The analyzed POS system running an instance of Iris 3.8 build 1052 was
found to be bound to several TCP ports. The services using these ports
are proprietary to Xpient and do not run OSS code. One TCP port (7510)
was accessible without any authentication or layer of encryption
required to execute code which triggered specific functionality. This
was abused in order to send a specific command to the service which
would in turn cause the cash drawer peripheral to unlock and open
revealing the contents.

The command used consists of two integers separated with a single
whitespace:

/-----
/bin/echo 1 1 || /bin/nc <POS-IP>: 7510
-----/


8.1. *Proof of Concept*

The following Python script can be used to exploit this vulnerability.
