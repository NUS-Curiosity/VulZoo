The Barracuda Web Application Firewall 660 is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would execute in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

The Barracuda Web Application Firewall 660 firmware 7.3.1.007 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
