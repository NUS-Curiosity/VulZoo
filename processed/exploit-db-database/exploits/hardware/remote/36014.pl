#
#  Digital video recorder (DVR) surveillance is the use of cameras,
#  often hidden or concealed, that use DVR technology to record
#  video for playback or immediate viewing. As technological
#  innovations have made improvements in the security and
#  surveillance industry, DVR surveillance has become more
#  prominent and allows for easier and more versatile security
#  systems in homes and businesses. A DVR surveillance security
#  system can be designed for indoor use or outdoor use and can
#  often involve hidden security cameras, concealed “nanny cams”
#  for home security, and even personal recording devices hidden
#  on a person.
#
####
#
#  Description:
#  No authentication (login) is required to exploit this vulnerability.
#  This program demonstrates how unpatched security bug would enable
#  hackers to gain control of a vulnerable device while sitting
#  behind their keyboard, potentially thousands of miles away.
#  An unauthenticated attacker that is connected to the DVR's may be
#  able to retrieve the device's administrator password allowing them
#  to directly access the device's configuration control panel.
