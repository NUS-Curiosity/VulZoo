ml85p is a Linux driver for Samsung ML-85G series printers. It may be bundled with distributions of Ghostscript.

ml85p does not check for symbolic links when creating image output files.

These files are created in /tmp with a guessable naming format, making it trivial for attackers to exploit this vulnerability.

Since user-supplied data is written to the target file, attackers may be able to elevate privileges.
