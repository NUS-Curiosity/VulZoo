Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2013-021:
Multiple Vulnerabilities in Karotz Smart Rabbit

Published: 08/01/13
Version: 1.0

Vendor: Electronic Arts (http://www.ea.com/), formerly Mindscape, formerly Violet
Product: Karotz
Version affected:  12.07.19.00

Product description:
Karotz is the successor to the "Nabaztag". Nabaztag is a Wi-Fi enabled
ambient electronic device in the shape of a rabbit, invented by Rafi
Haladjian and Olivier MÃ©vel, and manufactured by the company Violet.[1]
Nabaztag was designed to be a "smart object" comparable to those
manufactured by Ambient Devices; it can connect to the Internet (to
download weather forecasts, read its owner's email, etc.). It is also
customizable and programmable to an extent.

Finding 1: Python Module Hijacking

CVE: CVE-2013-4867
CWE: CWE-427

During the setup process for a Karotz unit, if wifi is selected as the
method used to connect to the Internet, a python script named "autorunwifi"
is run as root to set up the wifi connectivity. This file, along with
several others, is placed in the root of a USB flash drive or hard drive.
Another file, named "autorunwifi.sig", contains a signature of autorunwifi
signed with the private key for Violet, to prevent modifications to the
"autorunwifi" script.

Since Python first attempts to load modules not built into Python from the
same directory as the invoked script, it is possible to override the
functionality of imported modules by placing a file with the same basename
as the module being imported and an extension of ".py". In this case, it is
possible to write a Python script named "simplejson.py" and place it in the
same directory as the other setup files, which will cause the contents of
simplejson.py to be executed at the beginning of the "autorunwifi" script
execution.

This attack requires a USB flash drive to be plugged into the Karotz unit,
and requires the Karotz to be turned off and on.

The following is a proof of concept "simplejson.py" file that will copy the
pubring.gpg file from the Karotz onto the inserted USB key, which is
processed with MD5 to produce the key used to decrypt the root filesystem
for the Karotz:

## simplejson.py
import os

os.system("cp /karotz/etc/gpg/pubring.gpg /mnt/usbkey")
## end simplejson.py

Finding 2: API Session Token Passed in Cleartext

CVE: CVE-2013-4868

There are two kinds of applications for the Karotz: hosted and external.
Hosted applications are stored and run on the Karotz itself. External
applications run outside the Karotz unit and control the Karotz through an
api at api.karotz.com. Both types of applications must specifically request
to use parts of the karotz in the manifest file of their application
package. For instance, if your application uses the webcam and ears, you
must specify in your application manifest that these will be used by your
application before they will be available to your application.

The control is performed over plaintext HTTP. As such, the session token
authenticating API calls used to control the Karotz is available to an
eavesdropping attacker. The session token can be used to perform any remote
API call available to the application. For instance, if the application
uses the webcam, a video could be captured using the webcam and sent to an
arbitrary server.


Vendor Response:
No response received.

Remediation Steps:
No official patch is available.  To limit exposure,
network access to these devices should be limited to authorized
personnel through the use of Access Control Lists and proper
network segmentation.
