OpenBSDs PF firewall in OpenBSD 4.3 up to OpenBSD-current is prone to a
remote Denial of Service during a null pointer dereference in relation with
special crafted IP datagrams. If the firewall handles such a packet the kernel
panics.


Steps to reproduce:

If you are behind a OpenBSD firewall this nmap scan should trigger the problem
and crash your firewall device:

nmap -sO $some_host_so_that_the_firewall_handles_the_packets

For more informations please do read the patch issued by OpenBSD.


Patches and Workaround:

Patches are provided for OpenBSD 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 (upcoming, release 1st of may)
and OpenBSD-current (via CVS only) and are avaiable at the errata website.
The developers provide hints for a workaround at their errata website too.



Kind regards,
Rembrandt
