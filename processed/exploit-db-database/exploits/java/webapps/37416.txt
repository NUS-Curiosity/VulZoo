Squiz CMS is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and an XML external entity injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers may exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, to perform XML based attacks (including local file disclosure), TCP port scans, and a denial of service (DoS) condition; other attacks are also possible.

Squiz CMS 4.6.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
