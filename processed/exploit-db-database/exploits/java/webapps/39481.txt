Affected versions: BES12 < 12.4

CVE: CVE-2016-1914 and CVE-2016-1915

+-----------+
|Description|
+-----------+

Blackberry BES12 is an enterprise mobile management solution and
contains a self-service web application available to mobile users. This
web application contains multiple vulnerabilities including
unauthenticated SQL
injection and reflected cross site scripting.

Limited access to an on-premise BES12 environment was provided during
the discovery of these vulnerabilities. The full impact of the
vulnerabilities in relation to compromising other portions of the BES12
solution, such as mobile devices, is unclear.

|Exploitation|
+------------+

*SQL Injection*

The Java servlet com.rim.mdm.ui.server.ImageServlet is vulnerable to SQL
injection via the imageName parameter. This servlet is exposed at
multiple paths and is used to fetch an image from the database:

/mydevice/client/image
/admin/client/image
/myapps/client/image
/ssam/client/image
/all/client/image


This was discovered on a production BES12 on-premise deployment and the
injection vector allowed both UNION and stacked queries to be executed
on the Microsoft SQL server used by BES12. This allows full read/write
access to the database, and can potentially result in command execution
via xp_cmdshell depending on the database user configuration.

The following proof of concept demonstrates an injection payload which
will select the entire obj_keystore_entry table. The query will
serialise the entire table into an XML document which is returned in the
HTTP response as UTF-16 without the leading BOM (byte order mark)
causing most text editors to fail to display the response correctly.

https://<server>/mydevice/client/image?imageName=ui.cobranded.login.logo'+UNION+ALL+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,(SELECT+*+FROM+obj_keystore_entry+FOR+XML+PATH(''))+--

The technique above can be used to download any database table available
to the BES12 database user.

Notable database tables are:
* obj_user which contains BES12 user details.
* obj_user_authentication which contains authentication tokens.
* obj_user_device which based on column names, contains enrolment
tokens, enrolment secrets and device encryption keys.

It is unclear if this information is sufficient to decrypt a lost/stolen
BES12 mobile device.


*Reflected Cross Site Scripting*

Two areas of the self-service web application exist where user-supplied
input is reflected directly in web pages, allowing a malicious user to
conduct Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks against users of the
application. While the application uses the HttpOnly cookie flag for
session tokens, successful exploitation allows malicious JavaScript to
perform any action within the application that the targeted user is able
to. The administrative web application is typically hosted on the same
domain and may be attacked using these XSS vectors, although this is
BES12 deployment specific.

The table below details where Cross Site Scripting was detected and
which parameters are vulnerable:

https://<server>/mydevice/index.jsp?locale="><script>alert(1)</script>
https://<server>/mydevice/loggedOut.jsp?locale="><script>alert(1)</script>
