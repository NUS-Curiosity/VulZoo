CiscoWorks Common Services is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using directory-traversal strings (such as '../') to gain access to arbitrary files on the targeted system. This may result in the disclosure of sensitive information or lead to a complete compromise of the affected computer.

This issue is being monitored by Cisco Bug ID CSCto35577.

CiscoWorks Common Services 3.3 and prior are vulnerable.
