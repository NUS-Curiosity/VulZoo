The ConcourseSuite is prone to a cross-site request-forgery vulnerability and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, add, delete, or modify sensitive information, or perform unauthorized actions. Other attacks are also possible.

ConcourseSuite version 6.1 (20120209) is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
