# Software description:
# Sweet Hawk Survey app ask customers for a 0-10 score instead of the normal good or bad question.
# You can get more granular satisfaction data without compromising the response rate.
# Ask an optional NPS question on the landing page. View reports and drill down into the response
# detail and go directly to the ticket. Easy to set up, just replace the survey place holder in
# your trigger or automation. Customize the landing pages for each of your brands.

# Technical Details & Impact:
# Attackers use vulnerable web pages to inject malicious code and have it stored on the web server
# for later use. The payload is automatically served to users who browse web pages and executed in
# their context. Thus, the victims do not need to click on a malicious link to run the payload.
# All they have to do is visit a vulnerable web page.

# POC

1. Open Support ticket in Zendesk and send XSS payload e.g;
<script>alert(1);</script>
2. Generate survey  request to rate the ticket and payload will execute;
