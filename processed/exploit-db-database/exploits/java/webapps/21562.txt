Wolfram Research's webMathematica is a Java based product which allows the inclusion of Mathematica content in a web environment. It includes CGI programs which generate image content based on user supplied input.

A file disclosure vulnerability has been reported with the MSP CGI program. A file name parameter supplied by the user is not properly validated. The inclusion of "../" character sequences allows the attacker to escape the web root, and view arbitrary system files.
