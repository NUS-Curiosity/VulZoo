Novell GroupWise WebAccess is prone to an HTML injection vulnerability. This may be used to inject hostile HTML and script code into the Web mail application. When a user opens an email containing the hostile code, it may be rendered in their browser.

Successful exploitation could potentially allow theft of cookie-based authentication. Other attacks are also possible.
