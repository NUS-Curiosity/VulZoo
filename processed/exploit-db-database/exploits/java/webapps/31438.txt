IBM Rational ClearQuest is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary local or remote script code in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Ration ClearQuest 2003.06.16, 7.0.0.1, 7.0.0.2, 7.0.1.0, and 7.0.1.1 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
