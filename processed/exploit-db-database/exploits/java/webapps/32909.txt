Novell Teaming is prone to a user-enumeration weakness and multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

A remote attacker can exploit the user-enumeration weakness to enumerate valid usernames and then perform brute-force attacks; other attacks are also possible.

The attacker may leverage the cross-site scripting issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Novell Teaming 1.0.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
