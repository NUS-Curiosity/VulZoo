[Product]
Microsoft Windows Media Center

Windows Media Center is a discontinued digital video recorder and media player created by Microsoft.
Media Center was first introduced to Windows in 2002 on Windows XP Media Center.


[Vulnerability Type]
XML External Entity MotW Bypass (Anniversary Edition)


[CVE Reference]
N/A


[Security Issue]
This vulnerability was originally released by me back on December 4, 2016, yet remains unfixed.
Now, to make matters worse I will let you know "mark-of-the-web" MotW does not matter here, its just ignored.
Meaning, if the .MCL file is internet downloaded it gets the MOTW but files still exfiltrated.

Therefore, I am releasing this "anniversary edition" XXE with important motw informations.

This is a fully working remote information disclosure vulnerability that still affects Windows 7.
Windows 7 is near end of life this January, yet it is still used by many organizations.
Furthermore, it seems that Windows 8.1 (Pro) can also run Windows Media Center but I have not tested it.

Host the "FindMeThatBiotch.dtd" DTD file in the web-root of the attacker server Port 80 etc...
Download the ".mcl" file using Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Check the MotW where you downloaded the .mcl file dir /r and note the Zone.Identifier:$DATA exists.
Open the file and BOOM! watch shitz leaving!... still vulnerable after all these years lol.

OS: Windows 7 (tested successfully) and possibly Windows 8.1 Pro
