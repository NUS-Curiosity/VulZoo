Severity Level:
===========
High

Technical Details & Description:
========================
It is possible to bypass Netscaler WAF using a method which may be called HTTP Header Pollution. The setup:

    An Apache web server with default configuration on Windows (XAMPP).
    A SOAP web service which has written in PHP and vulnerable to SQL injection.
    Netscaler WAF with SQL injection rules.

First request: ‘ union select current_user,2# - Netscaler blocks it.

Second request: The same content and an additional HTTP header which is “Content-Type: application/octet-stream”. - It bypasses the WAF but the web server misinterprets it.

Third request: The same content and two additional HTTP headers which are “Content-Type: application/octet-stream” and “Content-Type: text/xml” in that order. The request is able to bypass the WAF and the web server runs it.
