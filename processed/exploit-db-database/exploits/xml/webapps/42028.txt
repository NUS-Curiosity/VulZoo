SQL injection in INFOR EAM V11.0 Build 201410 search fields (web/base/..)  via filtervalue parameter
-------------------
Assigned CVE: CVE-2017-7952

Reproduction steps:
-------------------
1. Log in with your EAM account
2. Go to any page with a search or filter field in it (for example web/base/WSJOBS.xmlhttp)
3. Make any search and intercept the request with a proxy
4. In the intercepted request, replace the value of "filteroperator" parameter with IN.
5. The "filtervalue" become vulnerable to SQL Injection

Example:
-------------------
URL:http://<EAM_IP>/web/base/WSJOBS.xmlhttp
POST DATA:
GRID_ID=<ID>&GRID_NAME=WSJOBS&DATASPY_ID=<ID>&USER_FUNCTION_NAME=WSJOBS&SYSTEM_FUNCTION_NAME=WSJOBS&CURRENT_TAB_NAME=LST&COMPONENT_INFO_TYPE=DATA_ONLY&filterfields=<field>&filteroperator=IN&filtervalue=<injection point>

Exploitability
-------------------
Since the SQL injection vulnerability is available for any logged users, an
attacker needs a valid credential to exploit that vulnerability. By
exploiting that SQL Injection the attacker could obtain any available data
(even if they donâ€™t belongs directly to him), eventually deleting and
replacing data as well.

Impact
-------------------
This vulnerability allows full database access. It includes sensitive
information that normally should be accessed by specific users.
An attacker could dump the user table, which contains usernames and
password hashes, and proceed to bruteforcing passwords offline and could
possibly obtain administrative credentials, or could access private files
or personal details such as: telephone numbers, physical address and
private assets.
Obtaining administrative credentials would allow an attacker to perform
actions like: add or deleting users, jobs, and everything else an admin can
do.
By having access to sensible information the attacker could eventually
pivoting them to perform further attacks on different target assets.
