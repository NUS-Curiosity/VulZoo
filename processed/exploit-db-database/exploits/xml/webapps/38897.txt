OpenMRS 2.3 (1.11.4) Expression Language Injection Vulnerability


Vendor: OpenMRS Inc.
Product web page: http://www.openmrs.org
Affected version: OpenMRS 2.3, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0 (Platform 1.11.4 (Build 6ebcaf), 1.11.2 and 1.10.0)
                  OpenMRS-TB System (OpenMRS 1.9.7 (Build 60bd9b))

Summary: OpenMRS is an application which enables design
of a customized medical records system with no programming
knowledge (although medical and systems analysis knowledge
is required). It is a common framework upon which medical
informatics efforts in developing countries can be built.

Desc: Input passed via the 'personType' parameter is not
properly sanitised in the spring's expression language
support via 'addPerson.htm' script before being used. This
can be exploited to inject expression language (EL) and
subsequently execute arbitrary Java code.


Tested on: Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS
           Apache Tomcat/7.0.26
           Apache Tomcat/6.0.36
           Apache Coyote/1.1
