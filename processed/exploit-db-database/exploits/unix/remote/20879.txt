The rpc.yppasswdd server is used to handle password change requests from yppasswd and modify the NIS password file.

A buffer overrun vulnerability has been discovered in the rpc.yppasswdd utility distributed by multiple vendors. The problem occurs due to insufficient bounds checking before copying remotely-supplied user information into a static memory buffer. As a result, a malicious user may be capable of exploiting this issue to overwrite sensitive locations in memory and thus execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges.
