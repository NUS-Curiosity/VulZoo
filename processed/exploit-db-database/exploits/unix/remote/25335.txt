A remote information disclosure issue affects IBM iSeries AS400 LDAP Server. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly secure sensitive information.

An authenticated attacker may leverage this issue to disclose user names and account information of users in their group. This may facilitate further attacks against the affected server.
