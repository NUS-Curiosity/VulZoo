A vulnerability has been discovered in the Caching Proxy component bundled with the IBM Websphere Edge Server.

Due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input it is possible for an attacker to construct a malicious link which contains arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in the header of the website visited by the victim.

Attacks of this nature may make it possible for attackers to steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
