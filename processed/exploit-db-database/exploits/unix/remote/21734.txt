Jakarta Tomcat is a Java Servlet and JSP server produced by the Apache Software Foundation. Tomcat is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and other Unix based operating systems.

A cross site scripting vulnerability has been reported in some versions of Tomcat. Reportedly, if a HTTP request is made for a JSP, malicious script code embedded in the URI may be included in a page generated by Tomcat.

This may be related to the issues discussed in BID 2982. This has not, however, been confirmed.
