Python's 'imageop' module is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability.

Successful exploits may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of applications using the vulnerable Python modules. This may result in a compromise of the underlying system. Failed attempts may lead to a denial-of-service condition.

These issues affect versions prior to Python 2.5.2-r6.

import imageop
s = ''
imageop.crop(s, 1, 65536, 65536, 0, 0, 65536, 65536)
