Under certain configurations, UniVerse allows the 'uvadm' user to perform certain administration tasks for the software. It has been reported that the uvadmsh binary does not perform bounds checking when parsing command-line arguments. Because access to the vulnerable option is restricted to the uvadm user, other users may not be able to exploit this vulnerability.

While this vulnerability was reported in UniVerse version 10.0.0.9, previous versions are likely vulnerable as well.
