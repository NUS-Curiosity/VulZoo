IBM Lotus Notes is affected by three vulnerabilities concerning Java applets.

An attacker can exploit these issues to disclose potentially sensitive information, cause a web browser to open an arbitrary web page, and cause a stack-based buffer overflow that may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

IBM has confirmed these vulnerabilities and has stated that they are currently under investigation. IBM problem reports for these vulnerabilities are KSPR5YS6GR, KSPR62F4D3, and KSPR62F4KN.

}

Stack-based buffer overflow:
