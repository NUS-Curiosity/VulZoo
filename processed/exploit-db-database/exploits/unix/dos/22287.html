It has been reported that Netscape based browsers may be vulnerable to a denial of service condition when executing certain JavaScript methods.

If a malicious page containing a specially crafted JavaScript regular expression method is viewed the browser reportedly becomes un-stable this may result in the critical failure of an affected browser.

This vulnerability was reported for Netscape version 7. It is not known if previous versions are also affected.
