A denial of service vulnerability is reported in the Caching Proxy component bundled with the IBM Websphere Edge Server.

It is reported that if the proxy is configured with the JunctionRewrite directive in conjunction with the UseCookie option, an attacker may be able to crash the application.

A remote attacker reportedly is able to cause a denial of service condition with one request.

IBM has released a patch dealing with this issue. This patch is available only to customers with support levels 2 or 3.
