OpenServer is commercial Unix operating system originally developed by SCO, and distributed by Caldera.

It may be possible for a local user to gain elevated privileges. When Xsco is executed, and an excessively long argument is supplied to the -co flag, a heap overflow occurs. This problem could allow a local user to supply a maliciously formatted string with the -co option that could result in the execution of arbitrary code, and elevated privileges.

./Xsco :1 -co `perl -e 'print "A" x 9000'`
