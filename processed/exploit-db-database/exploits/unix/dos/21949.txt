A vulnerability has been reported in the Caching Proxy component bundled with IBM WebSphere Edge Server. The vulnerability is due to inadequate checks when processing HTTP headers.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed HTTP request to the Caching Proxy. When the service attempts to process the request the service will crash thereby causing the denial of service.
