ntping is a component of scotty, a Tcl interpreter used to retrieve status and configuration information for TCP/IP networks. The utility, which runs with root privileges, contains a locally exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker can supply a long string as a command line argument to ntping, which, if the argument is of sufficient length (approximately 9000 characters) will induce a segfault.

If the input is carefully constructed, a local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the target host.
