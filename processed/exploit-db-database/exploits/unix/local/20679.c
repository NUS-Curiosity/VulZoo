ascdc is a program written for X by Rob Malda. It is designed to provide a graphical interface to cd changing on linux systems.

A vulnerability in the program could allow elevated privileges on a system with the package installed setuid. Due to insufficent bounds checking, it is possible to execute arbitrary code with the ascdc program. Overflows in the -c, -d, and -m arguments make it possible for a user to overwrite variables on the stack, including the return address, and execute shellcode.

The program is not installed setuid. However, in a setuid installation, this problem makes it possible for a user to execute arbitrary code, and potentially gain elevated privileges.

/* /usr/X11R6/bin/ascdc local exploit.
 * (version: ascdc-0.3-2-i386)
 *
 * Vulnerability found by Christer ï¿½berg, Wkit Security AB
 *
 * <cut and pasted from the advisory posted on bugtraq>
 *
 * There are multiple buffer overflows in ascdc that can be exploited to
 * gain root if it is installed setuid root. It is NOT installed setuid root
 * by default but as the README says:
 * "If you intend to use the automounting feature, you must either run
 * ascdc as root or setuid it."
