It has been reported that ascpu is vulnerable to a leakage of open file descriptors that may result in unauthorized disclosure of kernel memory. It is allegedly possible for attackers to inherit the open file descriptors for /dev/mem and /dev/kmem by executing a malicious program through ascpu. The program that is executed can be specified by the attacker at the command line.

ascpu -exe "dummy&/usr/local/sbin/lsof|grep dummy|grep mem"
