ascdc is a program written for X by Rob Malda. It is designed to provide a graphical interface to cd changing on linux systems.

A vulnerability in the program could allow elevated privileges on a system with the package installed setuid. Due to insufficent bounds checking, it is possible to execute arbitrary code with the ascdc program. Overflows in the -c, -d, and -m arguments make it possible for a user to overwrite variables on the stack, including the return address, and execute shellcode.

The program is not installed setuid. However, in a setuid installation, this problem makes it possible for a user to execute arbitrary code, and potentially gain elevated privileges.
