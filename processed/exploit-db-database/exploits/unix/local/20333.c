A potential local root yielding buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Exim mail client version 1.62.

A buffer used in processing filenames of message attachments can be overflowed by a maliciously-formed filename. As a result, the excessive data copied onto the stack can overwrite critical parts of the stack frame such as the calling functions' return address. Since this data is supplied by the user it can be a crafted so that alter the program's flow of execution. If properly exploited, this can yield root privilege to the attacker.
