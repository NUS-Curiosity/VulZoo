The LPRng software is an enhanced, extended, and portable implementation of the Berkeley LPR print spooler functionality.

When the LPRng daemon is initialized, it fails to drop its supplementary groups. As a result, the daemon and any child processes it spawns will maintain the supplementary groups inherited from the process that started LPRng.

Processes or routines which are meant to be run with lowered privileges will run with these supplementary group privileges. Vulnerable sections of program code are often run with lowered privileges because of susceptibility to attacks. Because they are not dropped, these privileges may be gained by an attacker if LPRng is vulnerable to such attacks.

LPRng-3.7.4-23  (and earlier)  +  tetex-1.0.7-7   (and earlier?)

     Insecure tmp file privilege elevation vulnerability.

Allows uid/gid lp  and  root groups on LPRng-3.6.24 and earlier
Please note:

-rwxr-xr-x    1 lp       lp         444472 Jun 14 22:05 /usr/bin/lpq*
-rwxr-xr-x    1 lp       lp         441624 Jun 14 22:05 /usr/bin/lprm*
-rwxr-xr-x    1 lp       lp         459160 Jun 14 22:05 /usr/bin/lpr*
-rwxr-xr-x    1 lp       lp         448120 Jun 14 22:05 /usr/bin/lpstat*
-rwxr-xr-x    1 lp       lp         448320 Jun 14 22:05 /usr/sbin/lpc*

 this program allows trojan code to be planted on the machine it is
 executed on.

 tmp file handling done badly in helper application (dvi print filter)
 allows modification to lp config files.
 the configuation file is sourced by the master print filter,
 which is itself a shell script, each time something is printed.
 this makes it possible to insert commands into the configuration file
 by creating a special filename to be included in the file that
 is created. (see the close(open(" thingee )


Redhat Bugzilla reference:-

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43342

 --zen-parse

 requires some fonts get made when its run.
 probably won't be a problem unless someone
 else has tried this exploit.
 just wait 90 days for /var/lib/texmf to clear
 and try again ;]
 or try print something different
 .dvi files are what does the trick.
