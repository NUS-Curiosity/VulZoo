The libXt library is part of the X Windows system. There are several buffer overflow conditions that may allow an unauthorized user to gain root privileges through setuid and setgid programs that are linked to libXt. These problems were openly discussed on the Bugtraq mailing list in 1996, this discussion led the OpenGroup (maintainers of the X-Windowing System) to release a new version of X Windows which was more thoroughly audited and which hopefully addressed a series of buffer overflows.
