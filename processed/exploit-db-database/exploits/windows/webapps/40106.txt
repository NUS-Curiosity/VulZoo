1. Description

After decompiling the SWF file "Main.swf", a hardcoded credential in one of the products of GSX, namely GSX Analyzer, has been found. Credential is a superadmin account, which is not listed as a user in the userlist, but can be used to login GSX Analyzer portals. Seemingly a backdoor or a "solution" to provide "support" from the vendor.

The found credentials are:
Username: gsxlogin
Password: gsxpassword

2. Proof of Concept

A few sites externally on the internet are affected by this incident. Presumably all of the externally disclosed GSX analyzer portals have this vulnerability.

Code snippet:
-----------------
if ((((event.getLogin().toLowerCase() == "gsxlogin")) && ((event.getPwd() == "gsxpassword")))){
-----------------

3. Solution:

Vendor has been informed on 12-06-16, also CERT has been notified with ID VR-241
