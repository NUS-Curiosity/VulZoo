Vendor:
===============
www.sawmill.net



Product:
========================
Sawmill Enterprise v8.7.9

sawmill8.7.9.4_x86_windows.exe
hash: b7ec7bc98c42c4908dfc50450b4521d0

Sawmill is a powerful heirarchical log analysis tool that runs on every
major platform.


Vulnerability Type:
===================================
Pass the Hash Authentication Bypass



CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-5496



Security Issue:
=====================
Sawmill suffers from a classic "Pass The Hash" vulnerability whereby an
attacker who gains access to the hashed user account passwords
can login to the Sawmill interface using the raw MD5 hash values, allowing
attackers to bypass the work of offline cracking
account password hashes.


This issue usually is known to affect Windows systems e.g. (NT Pass the
Hash/Securityfocus, 1997). However, this vulnerability can also
present itself in a vulnerable Web application.

Sawmill account password hashes are stored under LogAnalysisInfo/ directory
in "users.cfg".

e.g.

users = {
  root_admin = {
    username = "admin"
    password_checksum = "e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03"
    email_address = ""


This config file is stored local to the Sawmill application. However, if an
attacker gains access to a backup of the config that is
stored in some other location that is then compromised, it can lead to
subversion of Sawmills authenticaton process.

Moreover, since 'users.cfg' file is world readble a regular non Admin
Windows user who logs into the system running sawmill can now grab
a password hash and easily login to the vulnerable application without the
needing the password itself.


How to test?


Sawmill running (default port 8988), log off Windows and switch to a
"Standard" Windows non Administrator user.

1) Open "users.cfg" under Sawmills directory "C:\Program Files\Sawmill 8\LogAnalysisInfo" and copy the root_admin Admin password hash.

2) Go to the Sawmill login page in web browser http://VICTIM-IP:8988/ enter username 'admin' and the hash, Tada! your Admin.


Finally, Sawmill passwords are hashed using vulnerable MD5 algorithm and no
salt.


e.g.

password: abc123
MD5 hash:
e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03
