[Info]

Surgeftp web-interface suffers with multiple Stored XSS vulnerabilities.

They are:

Stored XSS in 'Domain Name' field.

[How to?]
1. Open SurgeFTP web interface, Click on global option from the menu.
2. Add a new domain, in 'Domain Name' field, add in this(<img src=x onmouseover=alert(1)>) payload.
3. Save, then navigate to main page, hover mouse over 'broken image' in 'domains' section.

Stored XSS in 'Mirrors'.

[How to?]
1. Open surgeftp web interface, Click on 'Mirrors' option from the menu.
2. Click on Add Mirror, in 'Local path' & 'Remote Host' field add in this(<img src=x onmouseover=alert(1)>) payload.
3. Save, then navigate to 'Mirror' page again, Hover mouse over the 'broken image' in 'local path' & 'remote host' field.

Previously, Somebody else reported Stored XSS vulnerabilities in SurgeFTP.
Vendor tried to fix the previously reported XSS vulnerabilities by blacklisting only the <script>alert('blah')</script> payload
which is well not a good practice since i have triggered the same vulnerability by just entering different XSS payload,
therefore White-listing is the correct solution.
