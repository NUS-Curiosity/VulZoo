Hello
I have recently released this vulnerability in a talk:

- Title: GleamtechFileVista/FileUltimate 4.6 Directory Traversal can lead to file upload attack
- Credit goes to: Soroush Dalili
- Link:http://www.gleamtech.com/download
- Description:
It is possible to bypass directory traversal validation of FileVista/FileUltimate version 4.3 by using "..[SPACE]/" or "..[SPACE]\". As a result, it can be possible to bypass the security restrictions and upload an arbitrary file and execute that on the server.
