*On one machine (Windows Server 2003), install a new instance of AMS with
these configurations*

1. Primary Domain: hack.local
2. Enable the WebMail Service
3. Domain Name: hack.local
4. Add a User and set Password. In this case I created a user named,
victim, with a password of victim
5. Finish installation


*On an instance of Kali*

1. Open a web browser and navigate to AMS WebMail Login
2. Log in as the user victim
3. Go to Options -> Advanced Options
4. Verify that the Password Resetting section is blank
5. Start Apache and place csrf-password_reset.js in /var/www/ability
6. As a sanity check, try to navigate to csrf-password_reset.js to make
sure you can access it, i.e. 192.168.1.1/ability/csrf-password_reset.js
7. Update resetpassword.py with the IP addresses of the server running
AMS and the kali attack machine. If the user/password account you created
in AMS is different, update that information here as well.
8. Run the script by typing, "python resetpassword.py"
9. Go back to your web browser, you should notice that victim now has an
email
10. Open the email
11. You should observe an alert box that says, Password Reset!
12. Click OK
13. Go to Options -> Advanced Options
14. Verify that the Password Resetting section is now populated with the
question and answer set to hacked
15. Logout of AMS
16. Click on Return to Login Page
17. Click on Forgot your password?
18. Enter an email address of victim@hack.local
19. Enter an answer of hacked and set a new password (you can leave zip
code and telephone number blank)
20. Click on Return to Login Page
21. Login as user victim with the password you have chosen
