Apparently they
published the CVE above without mentioning my name, since I found it in the
same time while IBM's team found it. This mail contains the exploitation
methods of the CVE
above<http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21607481>

*Description:* Malicious user is able to access other user's files and
filespaces.
*
*
*Details:*
*1. Privilege escalation to view other user's files and filespace*
I logged on using user "user2" (non-administrative account
with download\upload files permissions only) and then sent a GET request to
the following URL:
/transfer/?start=0&count=10&metadata=fteSamplesUser=user1
As a result, the response included the data of "user1".

*2. Privilege escalation to download user user's files*
In order to execute the attack, the malicious user should know the file
name and the related ID before executing the attack.
In this scenario, The malicious user is "user2" and the attacked user is
"user1".
If "user2" knows the url to file of "user1", then he can access this file,
e.g. "user2" is able to access the following URL using a GET request:
/filespace/user1
/414d512057514d542020202020202020eb3bfc4f2030df02/changedthisfilename.txt
