# The toolset can be used to troubleshoot the frequent network problems such as network
# connectivity, availability, performance, health, and latency of any IP node in the network.
# It provides desktop details like CPU, Disk space information, installed software,
# process information and other vital metrics. Readymade tools to manage DNS names,
# IP and MAC addresses are also available. SNMP tools are included to help monitor
# any SNMP-enabled IP node. Graphs, charts, and tables offer real-time views of
# the network and system information. Results can be exported as reports in various
# formats like PDF and HTML.

# Vulnerability:
# The XSS is triggered by configuring a snmpd.conf file to point to an attacker-controlled

# Adding the target machine either via a network scan or manually by adding the IP to the host list
# ManageEngine monitors. When a SNMP Scan is initiated, we are presented with a couple of
# nice alert boxes.
