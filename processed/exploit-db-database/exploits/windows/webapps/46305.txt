An attacker can force the web server to request remote files and display the output by placing any arbitrary URL in the "url" parameter of /api/DownloadUrlResponse.ashx. This can also be utilised to request files from the local file system by using the file:// URI syntax, such as file://C:/WINDOWS/System32/drivers/etc/hosts

Proof of concept: curl -H "ApiKey: apiKey" http://target/api/DownloadUrlResponse.ashx?url=file://C:/WINDOWS/System32/drivers/etc/hosts
