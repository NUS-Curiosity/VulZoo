Details:

Application is vulnerable to SQL injection.
Impact:

An attacker with access to the vulnerable pages could manipulate the queries being sent to the database, potentially enabling them to:

- Extract sensitive information, including (but not limited to) authentication credentials and personal details. Such information could be sold by the attacker to other malicious individuals, used in other attacks (as the same password is often used across systems) or released publicly to damage the organisation’s reputation.

- Modify content within the application. If this was possible, the attacker could add malicious code to the application, which could then be used to deliver malware or exploit issues within client browsers.

In this particular instance, exploitation was more difficult as the results of the attack had to inferred based on the pages returned, often referred to as “blind” SQL Injection. This does not prevent exploitation, it simply means that the methods required to perform this attack require a very large number of requests to be made. However, because of this it is potentially easier to identify that an attack using this method is being attempted.
