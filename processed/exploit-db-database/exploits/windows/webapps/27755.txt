| OVERVIEW |
+----------+

The release of this advisory provides exploitation details in relation to a
known patched vulnerability in Adobe ColdFusion 9.   These details were
obtained through the Packet Storm Bug Bounty program and are being released
to the community.

The details of this issue were already leaked in the following Metasploit
module:

| DETAILS |
+---------+

Adobe ColdFusion versions 9.0, 9.0.1, and 9.0.2 do not properly check the
"rdsPasswordAllowed" field when accessing the Administrator API CFC that is
used for logging in. That CFC "Contains basic Administrator functionality,
including login, logout, the Migration wizard, and the Setup wizard. You must
call the login method before calling any other methods in the Administrator
API."

The login function never checks if RDS is enabled when rdsPasswordAllowed="true".
This means that if RDS was not configured, the RDS user does not have a password
associated with their username. This means by setting rdsPasswordAllowed to
"true", we can bypass the admin login to use the rdsPassword, which in most
cases, is blank.

By default (and in most production environments), RDS will be disabled thus
never have been configured. If a user can access the ColdFusion 9.0
administrator located at /CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm and also access the
file /CFIDE/adminapi/administrator.cfc, it is possible to fully bypass the
admin login. ColdFusion 9.0, 9.0.1, and 9.0.2 do not properly check if RDS
was ever enabled.

+------------------+
| PROOF OF CONCEPT |
+------------------+

Sample code below; no changes are needed except to substitute
[HOSTNAME]/CFIDE/adminapi/administrator.cfc with the proper location
of the adminapi/administrator.cfc. You may save this file as test.html on
your desktop and open it from there. After submitting this page, you will be
logged in when going to the ColdFusion administrator page located at
http://[HOSTNAME]/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm

<form action="http://[HOSTNAME]/CFIDE/adminapi/administrator.cfc?method=login" method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="adminpassword" value="">
    <input type="hidden" name="rdsPasswordAllowed" value="1">
    <input type="submit">
</form>
