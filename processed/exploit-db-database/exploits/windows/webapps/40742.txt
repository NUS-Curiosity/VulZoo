Discovery Status:
=================

Affected Product(s):
====================
Adobe Systems
Product: Adobe Connect - Online Service (Web-Application) 2016 Q2


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity Level:
===============
Medium


Technical Details & Description:
================================
An application-side input validation and xss vulnerability has been discovered in the Adobe Connect online web-application and v9.5.6 windows software.
The input validation and filter issue allows remote attackers to inject own malicious script codes to the server-side of the vulnerable modules context.

The vulnerability is located in the `firstname`,`lastname` and `companyname` parameter of the `event_registration.html` file submit POST method request.
Remote attackers are able to inject own malicious script codes in the vulnerable parameters POST method request to manipulate the adobe connect events
service emails for the webinar registration module. The email body does not encode the input values and the registration is not restricted on inputs as
well, which results in the application-side script code execution. Attackers are also able to followup the webinar links with the injected credentials
which may be result in a second persistent script code execution as well. The injection point is the registration input form of the webinar in adobe
connect and the execution point occurs in the email body context of the admin@adobeconnect.com email address.

The security risk of the persistent input validation web vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.8.
Exploitation of the persistent input validation web vulnerability requires a low privilege web-application user account and low user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in session hijacking, persistent phishing attacks, persistent redirect to external sources
and persistent manipulation of affected or connected service module context.

Request Method(s): Inject
				[+] POST

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Events - Webinar Registration Form

Vulnerable File(s):
				[+] event_registration.html

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] firstname
				[+] lastname
				[+] companyname

Affected Module(s):
				[+]  (admin@adobeconnect.com)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without privileged web-application user account and with low user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1.  Open your mailbox and click to the portals webinar email for administrators
2.  Surf to the signup registration of adobe connect next to the events reck
3.  Inject to the firstname, lastname and companyname your own script code payload
4.  Submit the POST request to get activated for the webinar to hackerone via adobe connect
5.  Check the local input of the registered account
6.  The script code payloads of the name values are replied by the email service without secure encode
Note: The execution of the payloads occurs directly after the arrival and view
7.  Now choose in the email the link to the webinar that is connected to the name values
8.  Join the channel and write a message for interaction
9.  The code executes in several sections of the webinar adobe connect events service with persistent vector
10. Successful reproduce of the both application-side vulnerabilities in adobe via hackerone!

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
The vulnerability can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the vulnerable firstname, lastname and companyname input fields in
the registration file POST method request.
Dissallow the usage of special chars and restrict the input to prevent further script code injection attacks.
Encode the email body context of the adobe connect service mails after the registration. Block script code tags or escape and encode them as well.

Please follow the instructions in the adobe security bulletin to resolve the issue - Adobe Connect 	9.5.7 windows desktop version.
