Introduction:
=============
Dell SonicWALL Scrutinizer is a multi-vendor, flow-based application traffic analytics, visualization and reporting tool
to measure and troubleshoot network performance and utilization while increasing productivity for enterprises and service providers.
Scrutinizer supports a wide range of routers, switches, firewalls, and data-flow reporting protocols, providing unparalleled insight
into application traffic analysis from IPFIX/NetFlow data exported by Dell SonicWALL firewalls, as well as support for a wide range
of routers, switches, firewalls, and data-flow reporting protocols. IT administrators in charge of high throughput networks can
deploy Scrutinizer as a virtual appliance for high performance environments.

Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
DELL
Product: Sonicwall OEM Scrutinizer 9.5.2


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
High


Details:
========
A blind SQL Injection vulnerability is detected in the Sonicwall OEM Scrutinizer v9.5.2 appliance application.
The bug allows remote attackers to execute/inject own sql statement/commands to manipulate the affected vulnerable application dbms.
The sql injection vulnerability is located in the fa_web.cgi file with the bound gadget listing module and the vulnerable orderby or
gadget parameters. Exploitation requires no user interaction & without privileged application user account. Successful exploitation of
the remote sql vulnerability results in dbms & application compromise.

Vulnerable File(s):
			[+] fa_web.cgi

Vulnerable Module(s):
			[+] gadget listing

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
			[+] orderby
			[+] gadget


Proof of Concept:
=================
The remote sql injection vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without required privileged application user account
and also without user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Solution:
=========
1) Scrutinizer team created a own DB layer that will die if a semicolon is found within a SQL query
2) We have changed more queries to pass inputs as bound variables to the DB engine which prevents possible SQL injection


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the remote sql injection vulnerability is estimated as high(+).
