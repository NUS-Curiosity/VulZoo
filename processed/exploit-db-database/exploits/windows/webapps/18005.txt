Info

Open Computer and Software (OCS) Inventory Next Generation (NG) is an
application designed to help a network or system administrator keep track
of the computers configuration and software that are installed on the network.


Details

The vulnerability is in the data sent by the agent OCS. The inventory service
and the admin panel does not control the data received. An attacker could inject
malicous HTML/JS through into the inventory information (eg. the computer
description field under WinXP). This data is printed in the admin panel wich
can lead to a session hijack or whatever you want.


PoC

1. Enter the XSS script (eg. <script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>)
   in the computer description field. (WinXP > System Properties > Computer
   Name > Computer Description)

2. Launch an inventory with OCS Agent

3. Go on the admin panel (http://SERVER/ocsreports/)

4. View your computer detail

Tested on     : OCS Agent 2.0.1 (WinXP SP3) and OCS Server 2.0.1 (Windows).
Not tested on : Linux Plateform and GLPI (OCS import)
