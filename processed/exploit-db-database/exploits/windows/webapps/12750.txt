RapidWareX v2.0.1 (WebUI) is prone to a post-authentication CSRF vulnerability, which allows the attacker to have control over certain actions for the downloader such as Start/Retry, Pause, Clear All, Clear Finished, Add Links, etc.  Please note that in order to carry out the attack, the victim must have RapidWareX running and logged in.

The example below clears all the downloads when the victim enters the page.
