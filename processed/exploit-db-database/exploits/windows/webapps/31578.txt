CVE: CVE-2014-1204
CWE: CWE-89

It is possible for an authenticated user or guest user (if enabled) to
inject arbitrary SQL into the Tableau Server backend database. As a
proof of concept the default database user (Zrails) was retrieved using the
following payload:

http://127.0.0.1/views?modified_after=2013-12-08T23%3A00%3A00.000Z'%20or%20user%20like%20'Zrails

The database appears to be Oracle and both the modified_after and
modified_before parameters are vulnerable.

7.0.X is not affected.
