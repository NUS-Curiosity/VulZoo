Date: 09.02.16
Exploit Author: Tal Solomon of Palantir Security
Vendor Homepage: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1305937
Software Link: http://wildfly.org/downloads/
Version: This issue effects versions of Wildfly prior to 10.0.0.Final, including 9.0.2.Final, and 8.2.1.Final.
Tested on: Windows
CVE : CVE-2016-0793

An information disclosure of the content of restricted files WEB-INF and META-INF via filter mechanism was reported. Servlet filter restriction mechanism is enforced by two code checks:

if (path.startsWith("/META-INF") || path.startsWith("META-INF") || path.startsWith("/WEB-INF") || path.startsWith("WEB-INF")) {
    return false;
}

private boolean isForbiddenPath(String path) {
                return path.equalsIgnoreCase("/meta-inf/") || path.regionMatches(true, 0, "/web-inf/", 0, "/web-inf/".length());
}

which can be bypassed using lower case and adding meaningless character to path.
