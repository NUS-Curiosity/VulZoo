# Website: http://www.kwell.net
# CVE: CVE-2018-10201
# Category: Webapps

#[Description]
#
#It is possible to read arbitrary files outside the root directory of
#the web server. This vulnerability could be exploited remotely by a
#crafted URL without credentials, with …/ or …\ or …./ or ….\ as a
#directory-traversal pattern to TCP port 8667.
#
#An attacker can make use of this vulnerability to step out of the root
#directory and access other parts of the file system. This might give
#the attacker the ability to view restricted files, which could provide
#the attacker with more information required to further compromise the system.
