Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------
SynaMan 4.0 suffers from Authenticated Cross Site Scripting (XSS)


Prerequisites
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Admin access to Synaman web console

Proof of Concept

From Configuration > Advanced Configuration > Partial Branding
- Main heading
- Sub heading

If one were to apply the following XSS payload in either of the fields, alert pop-ups with xss would be present on navigation throughout the web app

<script>alert("xss");</script>

While Chrome does block the XSS payload on apply, simply hitting the back button and selecting "Explore" the payload is stored
