The Symantec Client Proxy ActiveX control is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Successful exploits allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application using the ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer). Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

The following are vulnerable:

Symantec AntiVirus 10.0.x and 10.1.x prior to 10.1 MR9
Symantec AntiVirus 10.2.x prior to 10.2 MR4
Symantec Client Security 3.0.x and 3.1.x prior to 3.1 MR9
