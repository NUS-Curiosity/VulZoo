Background:

The mentioned product, when installed, registers two classes
with the following settings:

binary path: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Aelita Shared\ARDoc.dll
CLSID: {C6FAAD6A-68AE-452B-9F7A-9293408F51EF}
ProgID: ARDOC.ReportTree.1
Implements IObjectSafety: yes
Safe For Scripting (IObjectSafety): True
Safe For Initialization (IObjectSafety): ?

binary path: C:\Program Files\Common Files\Aelita Shared\ARDoc.dll
CLSID: {EB5920E8-F6FA-4080-ADDC-AA03FA23E2AB}
ProgID: ARDOC.SimpleTree.1
Implements IObjectSafety: yes
Safe For Scripting (IObjectSafety): True
Safe For Initialization (IObjectSafety): ?

According to IObjectSafety interface, this control is safe
for scripting then Internet Explorer will allow scripting
of this control.

Vulnerability:
both classes expose insecure methods (read/write):


...
/* DISPID=34 */
/* VT_BOOL [11] */
function LoadFromFile(
        /* VT_BSTR [8]  */ $bstrFileName
        )
{
        /* method LoadFromFile */
}
/* DISPID=35 */
/* VT_BOOL [11] */
function SaveToFile(
        /* VT_BSTR [8]  */ $bstrFileName
        )
{
        /* method SaveToFile */
}
...

SaveToFile() allows arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

The resulting file has the following header:

D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1 00 00 00 00 ...

This seems a Microsoft Office file.

As attachment, two pocs, overwriting the boot.ini file. Change for your needs.

Other attacks are possible, including remote code execution
if the attacker is able to control file content.
At the time of report, however, this could not be achieved. I
will post updates on this if demonstrated.
