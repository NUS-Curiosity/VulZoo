Nullsoft SHOUTcast is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

This issue affects SHOUTcast 1.9.7 for Microsoft Windows; other versions may also be vulnerable.
