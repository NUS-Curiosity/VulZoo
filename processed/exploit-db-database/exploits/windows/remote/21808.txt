Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) classes are used by the Virtual Machine to provide connectivity to various data sources.

It is possible to spoof a JDBC class request to make it appear as though it came from an authorized applet. This could allow execution of any DLL on the system by a remote attacker.

new com.ms.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbc("C:\\mydll\000");

This results in the malicious applet loading the attacker-supplied DLL 'C:\mydll.dll'.
