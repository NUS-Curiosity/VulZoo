Microsoft Windows is prone to a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue exists in 'winhlp32.exe' and is exposed when a malformed phrase compressed Windows Help file (.hlp) is processed by the program.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user that opens the malicious Help file. The Help file may originate from an external or untrusted source, so this vulnerability is considered remote in nature.
