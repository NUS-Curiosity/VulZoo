It is reported that thttpd is susceptible to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue presents itself due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. This issue only exists in the Windows port of the application, as it does not correctly take into consideration the environmental attributes of file system access in applications.

This issue may allow an attacker to retrieve arbitrary, potentially sensitive files, from the affected host computer, as the user that the thttpd process is running as.

Version 2.07 beta 0.4 of thttpd, running on a Microsoft Windows platform is reported vulnerable to this issue.
