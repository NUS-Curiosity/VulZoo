Rbot is prone to an unauthorized-access vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrative rights to the rbot application. This will allow a remote attacker to execute Ruby code within the context of the affected application; other attacks may be possible.

rbot 0.9.14 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
