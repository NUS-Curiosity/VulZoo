Nokia Electronic Documentation (NED) is prone to a vulnerability that may enable remote attackers to list directory contents. This issue may be exploited by appending a dot (.) to a request for a NED page. Exploitation will also have the side-effect of disclosing the path to the directory.

This issue was reported for NED installations hosted on WebLogic application servers. It is not known if NED is prone to the same behavior when hosted on other servers. It should be noted that although this vulnerability has been reported to affect Nokia Electronic Documentation version 5.0, previous versions might also be affected.
