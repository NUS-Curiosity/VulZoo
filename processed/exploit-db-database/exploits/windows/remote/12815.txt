Description of Software: "The GoAhead WebServer is a fast and efficient
standards-based Web server designed for cross-platform support.
While WebServer is designed for embedded devices it is nevertheless a fully
functional web server and its use is not limited to
embedded devices. WebServer's small foot-print and efficient design make it
well suited for a wide range of applications."

Problem: Appending a '.' or '%20' to a URL will result in a source code
disclosure of whichever file is requested.
This did not work for files in /cgi-bin/ directory when tested, but seems to
work for other files/directories.
This technique only works on Windows systems, as Windows ignores periods and
spaces after files.
Sadly this software has not been updated since 2003 and remains public
despite known vulnerabilities dating to 2003/2004.
