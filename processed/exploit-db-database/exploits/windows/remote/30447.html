Tor is prone to an unauthorized-access vulnerability due to a design error when handling multiple connections to the ControlPort.

An attacker can exploit this issue to reconfigure Tor and significantly weaken the anonymity provided by the software.

Tor 0.1.2.15 is confirmed vulnerable; previous versions may also be affected.

<!--

Tor < 0.1.2.16 with ControlPort enabled ( not default )
Exploit for Tor ControlPort "torrc" Rewrite Vulnerability
http://secunia.com/advisories/26301

Rewrites the torrc to log to a different location: C:\Documents and
Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\t.bat
Also enables debug logging, and an erroneous ExitPolicy looking
something like this: reject*:1337\&#039;&&#039; calc.exe  this will output:
[debug] parse_addr_policy(): Adding new entry &#039;reject*:1337&#039;& calc.exe
to the debug log -> t.bat which will run calc.exe on next boot.

This is not very silent though, t.bat will contain something like 45
rows of crap which the user will see in about 1 sec, drop me a mail if
you have a better way.

Either have a TOR user visit this HTML or inject it into her traffic
when you&#039;re a TOR exit.
If you inject, just replace </HEAD> with everything in <HEAD> + </HEAD>
( that&#039;s why I tried to fit everything inside <HEAD />), and fix
