ServletExec/ISAPI is a plug-in Java Servlet/JSP engine for Microsoft IIS. It runs with IIS on Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP systems.

ServletExec/ISAPI discloses the absolute path to the webroot directory when sent a specially formatted request without a trailing filename.

This type of sensitive information may aid in further attacks against the host running the vulnerable software.
