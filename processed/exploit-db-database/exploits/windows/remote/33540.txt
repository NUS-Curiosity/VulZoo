SurgeFTP is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in an administrator's browser session in the context of the affected site. This could potentially allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials; other attacks are also possible.

SurgeFTP 2.3a6 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
