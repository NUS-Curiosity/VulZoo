SurfControl SuperScout WebFilter Reports Server is prone to a vulnerability which may allow remote attackers to disclose the contents of arbitrary files.

The Reports Server does not sufficiently filter triple-dot-slash (.../) sequences from web requests. As a result, an attacker may break out of the root directory for the reporting service and browse the filesystem at large, disclosing arbitrary files that are readable by the Reports Server.
