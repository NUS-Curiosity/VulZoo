Snoopy is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers execute arbitrary commands because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

This issue may facilitate unauthorized remote access to the application in the context of the webserver.


https://www.%22;+echo+'hello'+%3E+test.txt

Passing this URI to a script that uses a vulnerable version of Snoopy will result in a file called 'test.txt' containing 'hello'.
