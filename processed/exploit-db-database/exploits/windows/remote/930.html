  The vulnerability:
  There is a race condition when using appendChild to append an element in one
  window to an element in another. A "dirty" read can be exploited to gain
  control over the process. The control can be gained because of this code:

  MSHTML.DLL @ 0x635F6074 (win2ksp4en)
  MOV     EAX, DWORD PTR [ESP+4]  ; EAX = Some pointer to the heap for mshtml
  MOV     EAX, DWORD PTR [EAX]    ; EAX = "dirty" value from heap
  JMP     NEAR DWORD PTR [EAX+8]  ; Jmp to memory pointed to by "dirty" value

  This is how we exploit it:
  - To get some control over the "dirty" value we try to "spray" the heap for
    mshtml with the value we want it to read. This is done with creatComment()s
    that contain a string full of our value. We want to spray effectve and
    fast, so we use as big a string as possible. If we use a string over 512
    bytes long, mshtml will write a pointer to the string instead of the string
    itself.
  - To jump to the right address, we have to make sure that the "dirty" value
    points to a pointer that in turn points to the address we want to jump to.

  The first part of the exploit will provide for all this in creating a
  number of dwords around 0x0D0D0D0D that all point to 0x0D0D0D0D. So if we
  "spray" the heap for mshtml with 0x0D0D0D0D, this is what will happen:

  MSHTML.DLL @ 0x635F6074 (win2ksp4en)
  MOV     EAX, DWORD PTR [ESP+4]  ; EAX = Some pointer to the heap fot mshtml
  MOV     EAX, DWORD PTR [EAX]    ; EAX = 0x0D0D0D0D
  JMP     NEAR DWORD PTR [EAX+8]  ; JMP [0x0D0D0D15] = JMP 0x0D0D0D0D
  HEAP @ 0x0D0D0D0D
  OR      EAX, 0x0D0D0D0D
  OR      EAX, 0x0D0D0D0D
  OR      EAX, 0x0D0D0D0D
  ...nopslide...
  shellcode

  This has proven to work quite reliable. Allthough testing showed that there
  is a chance we do not control the "dirty" value. In this case, the "dirty"
  value seems to be 0x11CF03f9 a lot of the time, so we make sure we cover
  that address with the '0D' nopslide-landingzone too.
