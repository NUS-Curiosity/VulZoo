The Windows clipboard contains data that has been cut or copied from various windows applications. This data can be accessed and posted to malicious web forms at web sites without the knowledge of the visiting end-user. Normally, Microsoft security prevents forms from accessing data other than what was copied from within the same application, however, a Microsoft Forms 2.0 TextBox ActiveX object can bypass these security rules.

The Forms 2.0 ActiveX object does not come with the Operating System. This control is loaded when Visual Basic 5.0, Project 98, Outlook 98, or Office 97 is installed on the host.

function GetClipBoard()
{
tb.paste(); // paste over the MS Forms 2.0 TextBox
document.forms(0).S1.value=tb.text; // moves the text to the text area box
}
