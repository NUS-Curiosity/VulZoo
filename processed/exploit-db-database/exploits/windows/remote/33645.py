The 'httpdx' program is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue allows an authenticated user to create directories outside the FTP root directory, which may lead to other attacks.

This issue affects httpdx 1.5; other versions may also be affected.
