Enemy Territory: Quake Wars is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

Enemy Territory: Quake Wars 1.5.12642.33243 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
