Keware Technologies HomeSeer is a home automation application which enables users to control various housewares and appliances locally or remotely via a web interface.

It is possible for a remote user to gain access to any known file outside of the HomeSeer directory on the root directory. A specially crafted HTTP request comprised of '../' and the known filename, will display the contents of the particular file with read permissions.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could enable a remote user to gain access to systems files, password files, etc. This could lead to a complete compromise of the host.
