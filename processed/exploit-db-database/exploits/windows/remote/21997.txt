A cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in Perception LiteServe. It should be noted that this vulnerability is limited to server configurations with Wildcard DNS enabled.

It has been reported that LiteServe fails to sanitize requested hostnames when Wildcard DNS is used. This issue may allow an attacker to create a malicious link containing encoded HTML and script code in the requested hostname.

When the malicious link is clicked by an unsuspecting user, the attacker-supplied HTML and script code will be executed by their web client.

Attacks of this nature may make it possible for attackers to manipulate web content or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. It may be possible to take arbitrary actions as the victim user.

This issue was reported in LiteServe v2.01. It is not yet known whether earlier versions are affected by this issue.
