The HTTP application is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to view arbitrary local files and directories within the context of the webserver. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

HTTP 1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

GET /..\..\\..\..\\..\..\\..\..\\\boot.ini HTTP/1.0
