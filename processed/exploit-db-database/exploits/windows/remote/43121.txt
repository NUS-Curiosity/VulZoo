Vulnerability Type:
===================
Remote Buffer Overflow



CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2017-11309
ASA-2017-307



Security Issue:
================
SoftConsole.exe does not check bounds when reading server response on making an outbound connection, resulting in a classic
Buffer Overflow exploit.

Avaya IP Office user must connect to a malicious server where a remote attacker can then deliver the buffer overflow
payload in the server response, exploiting the SoftConsole client. This vulnerability allows attackers to deliver and
execute arbitrary attacker supplied code on the Avaya host system.
