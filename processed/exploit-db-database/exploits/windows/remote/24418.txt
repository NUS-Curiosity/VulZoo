It is reported that Xedus is susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities.

The first reported issue is a denial of service vulnerability. The affected application is unable to service multiple simultaneous connections, denying access to the hosted site for legitimate users.

The second reported issue is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in included sample scripts. This vulnerability is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied URI input before including it in the output of the scripts.

The third reported issue is a directory traversal vulnerability. The affected application will reportedly serve documents located outside of the configured web root. This may allow an attacker the ability to read arbitrary, potentially sensitive files on the hosting computer with the privileges of the web server. This may aid malicious users in further attacks.

These vulnerabilities are reported to exist in version 1.0 of Xedus.
