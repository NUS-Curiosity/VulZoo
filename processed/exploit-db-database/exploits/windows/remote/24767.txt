It is reported that Soldier of Fortune 2 is susceptible to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to perform sufficient bounds checking on user-supplied input prior to copying it to a fixed-sized memory buffer.

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to deny service to legitimate users. Due to the nature of this vulnerability, it is conjectured that remote code execution may be possible, but this is not confirmed.
