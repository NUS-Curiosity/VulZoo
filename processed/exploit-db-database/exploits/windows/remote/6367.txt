Here is Description for this Vuln :
Â·          Type of Issue : Buffer Overflow.
Â·          Affected Software : Google Chrome 0.2.149.27.
Â·          Exploitation Environment : Google Chrome (Language: Vietnamese) on Windows XP SP2.
Â·          Impact: Remote code execution.
Â·          Rating : Critical .
Â·          Description :
The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when handling the â€œSaveAsâ€ function. On saving
a malicious page with an overly long title (<title> tag in HTML), the program causes a stack-based overflow and makes
it possible for attackers to execute arbitrary code on usersâ€™ systems.
Â·          How an attacker could exploit the issue :
To exploit the Vulnerability, a hacker might construct a specially crafted Web page, which contains malicious code.
He then tricks users into visiting his Website and convinces them to save this Page. Right after that, the code would
be executed, giving him the privilege to make use of the affected system.
