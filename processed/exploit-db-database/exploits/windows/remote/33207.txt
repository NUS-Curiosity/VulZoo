SmartVMD ActiveX control is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to adequately check boundaries on user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application using the ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer). Failed attacks will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

SmartVMD 1.3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
