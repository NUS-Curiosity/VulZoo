Microsoft IIS 5.0 ships with a sample script that may be used to view the source code of other scripts in the sample scripts (/IISSAMPLES) directory. However, this script (CodeBrws.asp) does not adequately filter unicode representations of directory traversals. For example, an attacker can break out of the sample script directory by substituting '%c0%ae%c0%ae' for '..' in a dot-dot-slash directory traversal attack.

It has been demonstrated that this issue may be exploited to map out the directory structure of the filesystem on a host running the vulnerable script.

The following example was also provided to demonstrate that the directory structure may be mapped out using this vulnerability:
