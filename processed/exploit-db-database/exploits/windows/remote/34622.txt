Axigen Webmail is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

Axigen Webmail 7.4.1 is vulnerable; other versions may be affected.
