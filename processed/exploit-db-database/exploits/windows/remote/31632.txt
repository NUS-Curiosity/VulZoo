Microsoft SharePoint Server is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data. Note that to perform attacks, an attacker requires access to a user account with sufficient privileges to edit pages.

Exploiting this issue may allow the attacker to execute HTML and script code in the context of the affected site, to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Microsoft SharePoint Server 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
