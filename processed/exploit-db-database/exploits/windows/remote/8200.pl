# Exploit: GuildFTPd FTP Server Version 0.x.x Remote Delete Files
#
# More detail for the vulnerability => http://secunia.com/advisories/32218/
#
# 2) A vulnerability is caused due to an input validation error when handling FTP "DELE"
# requests. This can be exploited to escape the FTP root and delete arbitrary files on
# the system via directory traversal attacks using the "\.." character sequence.
