It has been reported that Active Webcam webserver may be prone to a directory traversal vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information, which may be used to launch further attacks against a vulnerable system. The attacker may traverse outside the server root directory by using '../' or '..\' character sequences.

Active Webcam webserver versions 4.3 and prior released before December 17, 2003 are reported to be prone to this issue.
