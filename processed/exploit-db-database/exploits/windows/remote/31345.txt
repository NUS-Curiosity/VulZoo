MicroWorld eScan Server is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting this issue allows an attacker to access arbitrary files outside of the FTP server root directory. This can expose sensitive information that could help the attacker launch further attacks.

eScan Server 9.0.742.98 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
