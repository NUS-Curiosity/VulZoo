Snapstream Personal Video Station is an application for Microsoft Windows which allows users to record video output on their PC and view it at a later time, locally or via an HTTP interface. The Snapstream PVS web interface runs on port 8129.

Snapstream PVS is prone to attacks which allow a remote user to break out of the wwwroot and browse the filesystem at large. The remote attacker may accomplish this by crafting a web request which uses '../' sequences to traverse directories and access arbitrary web-readable files.

The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is that confidential information may be disclosed to the attacker and follow-up attacks against the host may occur.

If exploited conjunction with Bugtraq ID 3101, a remote attacker can gain the administrative password for Snapstream.
