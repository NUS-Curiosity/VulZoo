HP Instant Support 'HPISDataManager.dll' ActiveX control is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of an application using the ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer). Failed attacks will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

HP Instant Support 1.0.0.22 and earlier versions are affected.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 29526 (HP Instant Support 'HPISDataManager.dll' ActiveX Control Unspecified Code Execution Vulnerabilities), but has been given its own record because of new information.
