UltraVNC is susceptible to multiple error-logging remote buffer-overflow vulnerabilities. These issues are due to the application's failure to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before copying it to insufficiently sized memory buffers.

A successful attack may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable computer to gain unauthorized access in the context of the application.
