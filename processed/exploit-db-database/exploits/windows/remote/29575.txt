Plain Old Webserver is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to access sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

Version 0.0.7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
