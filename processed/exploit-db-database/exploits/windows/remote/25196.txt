It has been reported that a remote buffer overflow vulnerability affects Yahoo! Messenger. This issue is due to a failure of the application to securely copy user-supplied input into finite process buffers.

It is likely that the attacker must be in the contact list of an unsuspecting user to exploit this issue. It should be noted that the details surrounding this issue are not clear; this BID will be updated as more details are released.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of an unsuspecting user running a vulnerable version of the affected application.
