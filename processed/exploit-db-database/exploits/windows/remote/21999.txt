A cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in Perception LiteServe.

It has been reported that LiteServe fails to sanitize query strings from indexed folders. It is possible for an attacker to exploit this issue by constructing a malicious link, containing encoded HTML and script code.

When the malicious link is clicked by an unsuspecting user, the attacker-supplied HTML and script code will be executed by their web client.

Attacks of this nature may make it possible for attackers to manipulate web content or to steal cookie-based authentication credentials. It may be possible to take arbitrary actions as the victim user.
