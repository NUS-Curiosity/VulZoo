NetDecision is prone to multiple directory-traversal vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting the issues can allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

NetDecision 4.6.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
