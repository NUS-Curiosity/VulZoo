Working Resources BadBlue is a webserver intended to share various resources and is developed for Microsoft Windows environments.

BadBlue is prone to directory traversal attacks. It is possible for a remote attacker to submit a malicious web request containing triple-dot-slash (.../) sequences to break out of wwwroot. The attacker may browse arbitrary web-readable files on the host running the vulnerable software.

On Windows operating systems, webservers run in the SYSTEM context. A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to read any file on the host that will render in their web browser.

Deerfield's D2Gfx is powered by BadBlue v1.02 and should be considered vulnerable as well.
