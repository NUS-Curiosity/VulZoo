A heap overflow vulnerability has been discovered in Internet Explorer. It is reported that the issue presents itself when a comment character sequence that is not terminated is encountered after a STYLE tag.

This issue could be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the client user. The attacker would likely create a malicious HTML page and host it on a site. The attacker would then attempt to entice a user to visit the malicious page to carry out a successful attack.
