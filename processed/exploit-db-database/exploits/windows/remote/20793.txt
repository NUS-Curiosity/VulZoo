The Viking Server is a freely available software package maintained and distributed by Robtex. The Viking Server provides multiple protocol service on Windows 95, 98, and NT systems.

A problem in the software package could make it possible for remote users to gain access to sensitive system files. Due to the improper handling of relative paths by the HTTP serving portion of the Viking Server, a user requesting a relative path such as "\...\" can gain access to the root directory, breaking out of the webroot.

This problem makes it possible for remote user to gain access to sensitive system files, and potentially local access.
