WinPT (Windows Privacy Tray) is prone to a key-spoofing vulnerability because it fails to properly display user-supplied key data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to trick victim users into encrypting potentially sensitive information with a malicious key that appears to be legitimate.

WinPT 1.2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
