A weakness has been reported in the FTGatePro WebAdmin Interface that could allow an unauthorized user to gain sensitive information. The problem is believed to occur due to insufficient access controls put in place by FTGatePro. As a result, an attacker may be capable of viewing various configuration information, and possibly username and password data. Access to this data may aid an attacker in launching future attacks against the target system.

It should be noted that the FTGate Pro WebAdmin Interface is not accessible to the internet by default.
