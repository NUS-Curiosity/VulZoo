It has been reported that NetServe may be prone to a directory traversal vulnerability that may allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The issue presents itself due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. An attacker may traverse outside the server root directory by using '../' character sequences.

NetServe Web Server version 1.0.7 is reported to be prone to this issue, however other versions may be affected as well.
