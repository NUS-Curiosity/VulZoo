LOG-FT is reported prone to an arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability. This issue results from an access validation error and can allow a remote attacker to disclose sensitive data.

It is reported that an attacker can simply issue a specially crafted HTTP GET request to disclose sensitive files in the context of the affected Web server.

Information disclosed through this attack may expose sensitive data that may be used to carry out further attacks against a computer. It is not confirmed whether this issue may also allow an attacker to upload arbitrary files.
