O'Reilly WebBoard is a conferencing utility, forum, threaded discussion and real-time chat server.

Versions of WebBoard are vulnerable to a JavaScript code execution bug which may allow a remote denial of service against a target WebBoard user's system.

An attacker can compose a message in WebBoard's interactive messaging (paging) function, containing certain escape characters and JavaScript commands, and send the page to a target user. Upon receiving the message, the target client will improperly execute the JavaScript embedded in the page, which could result in the appearance of multiple message windows.

WebBoard is no longer supported by O'Reilly, it is currently maintained by ChatSpace, Inc.

An example of malicious javascript:

\');for(i=0;i<100000;i++) alert("not nice"); /
