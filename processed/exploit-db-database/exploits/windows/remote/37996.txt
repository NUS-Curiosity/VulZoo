Axigen Mail Server is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using directory-traversal strings (such as '../') to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service condition, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application. This could help the attacker launch further attacks.
