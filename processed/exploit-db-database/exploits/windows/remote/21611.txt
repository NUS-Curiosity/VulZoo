Lil' HTTP server is a web server application for Windows environments and is maintained by Summit Computer Networks.

It is possible for attackers to construct a URL to the 'pbcgi.cgi' script which includes scripting code to execute in a user's browser. As a result, when an innocent user follows such a link, the script code will execute within the context of the hosted site.
