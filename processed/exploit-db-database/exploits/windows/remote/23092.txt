FloosieTek FTGatePro Mail Server is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. A remote attacker could exploit this issue by enticing a legitimate user of the mail server to follow a malicious link with embedded HTML and script code. The attacker-supplied code would potentially be rendered in the user's browser when the link is followed.

This issue exists in the web administrative interface, which listens on port 8089 by default.
