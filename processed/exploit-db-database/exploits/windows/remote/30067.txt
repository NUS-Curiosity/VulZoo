rdiffWeb is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the webserver process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks.

This issue affects rdiffWeb 0.3.5; other versions may also be affected.
