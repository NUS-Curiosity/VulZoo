     details:
     CLSID: {01110800-3E00-11D2-8470-0060089874ED}
     Progid: Tioga.Editor.1
     Binary Path: C:\Programmi\File comuni\SupportSoft\bin\dnaedit.dll
     KillBitted: False
     Implements IObjectSafety: True
     Safe For Initialization (IObjectSafety): True
     Safe For Scripting (IObjectSafety): True

     vulnerabilities, discovered two months ago:
     insecure methods: Packagefiles() - remote file overwrite, directory traversal, *script injection* and ... a crash (investigating on this one)
                       SaveDna() - remote file creation, directory traversal
                       AddFile() - remote cpu consumption
                       SetIdentity() - remote file creation

     This dll was present inside the SupportSoft ActiveX Controls Security Update for a previous buffer overflow vulnerability,
     see: http://secunia.com/advisories/24246/
     My download url was: http://www.supportsoft.com/support/controls_update.asp
     actually unreachable

     Well, they probably patched my marking them unsafe for initialization (I see that the ScriptRunner module suffers  of a
     buffer overflow bug in the Evaluate() method...) but they gave you another vulnerable control...
