Pro Softnet IDrive Online Backup ActiveX control is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers overwrite files with arbitrary, attacker-controlled content.

An attacker can exploit this issue to corrupt and overwrite arbitrary files on a victim's computer in the context of the vulnerable application using the ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer).

IDrive Online Backup ActiveX control 3.4.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
