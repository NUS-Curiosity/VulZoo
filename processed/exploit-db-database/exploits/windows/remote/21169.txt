Due to a common design error, it may be possible for outbound packets to bypass packet filtering in many personal firewalls.

Many of these applications only block packets created by the standard Windows protocol adapter. It is possible for a user with administrative privileges to create packets with other protocol adapters that are not evaluated against the personal firewall rules when transmitted.

Exploitation will result in a violation of security policy.

Tiny Personal Firewall, ZoneAlarm and ZoneAlarm Pro are confirmed vulnerable. It is believed that other applications similar in design may also be vulnerable.
