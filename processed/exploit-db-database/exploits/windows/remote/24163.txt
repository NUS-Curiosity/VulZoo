Sambar Server is reportedly prone to multiple vulnerabilities. These issues may allow an attacker to access sensitive files and carry out directory traversal and cross-site scripting attacks.

These issues require an attacker to have administrative privileges, however, it is reported that an administrative password is not set on the server by default. An administrator who is not intended to have certain privileges may also exploit these vulnerabilities.

Sambar 6.1 Beta 2 is reported to be prone to these issues, however, it is likely that other versions are affected as well.
