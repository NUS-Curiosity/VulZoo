DivX Player is reported prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. The issue presents itself when DPS '.dps', archive files are processed.

Ultimately an attacker may exploit this issue to save a script or executable file in an arbitrary location. This may lead to the execution of malicious code when the affected system is restarted. Alternatively, the attacker may overwrite a target file with the privileges of a user that is installing a malicious skin file.
