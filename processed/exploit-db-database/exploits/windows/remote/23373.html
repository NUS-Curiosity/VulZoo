It has been reported that Opera is vulnerable to a directory traversal issue that may allow an attacker to access sensitive information. The problem presents itself due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data through the 'Opera:' URI handler. The issue may allow an attacker to traverse outside a directory by using '..%5c' or '..%2f' character sequences.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information that may be used to launch further attacks against a vulnerable system.

Opera Web Browser versions 7.22 and prior are reported to be prone to this issue.
