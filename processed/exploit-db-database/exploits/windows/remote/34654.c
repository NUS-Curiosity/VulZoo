SWiSH Max3 is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers execute arbitrary code.

An attacker can exploit this issue by enticing a legitimate user to use the vulnerable application to open a file from a network share location that contains a specially crafted Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file.

SWiSH Max3 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
