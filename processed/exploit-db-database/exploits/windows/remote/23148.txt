A vulnerability has been discovered in Nokia Electronic Documentation (NED) that may allow an attacker to redirect connections to a third party system. The problem likely occurs due to the NED server failing to sufficiently verify hosts provided within specific HTTP requests. As a result, an attacker may be capable of making a request that would cause data to be redirected to a third party system.

This may allow an attacker to interact with an otherwise inaccessible system, or potentially hide the origin of attacks launched against other targets.
