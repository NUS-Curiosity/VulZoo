PowerTCP FTP module Multiple Technique Exploit ( SEH Overwrite + HeapSpray )
bug originally found by : Intel (http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/6793)
I use Intel's exploit , but IE change unASCII bytes and it doesn't work! ( my system is XP SP2 IE7 ).
then I wrote my own expl with HeapSpray technique , but it doesn't work again.
block of heap that contain my address change after eip point to it!

you know what was happen ?? ( if know tell me plz)
again I wrote exploite ,but with SEH overwrite technique !!! ouch , it would not like to work!!!!
I use flash9d.ocx for bypass /SafeSeh but ...
at this time I combine SEH overwoite and HeapSpray technique and it work properly !
now Seh Handler point to 0x0a0a0a0a block , so shellcode execute properly without changing heap block!
I think overwriting seh handler with pop/pop/ret and Next handler pointer by 0xHeapAddr work good, try to do it.
