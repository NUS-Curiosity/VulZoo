Macromedia Flash Player is reported to store Flash cookies (.sol files) in a predictable location on client systems. Other attacks are possible given the ability to store content on a system in a predictable location, such as referencing the content via a file:// URI. This is compounded by the fact that an attacker could include HTML and script code in the cookie, which may be interpreted by Internet Explorer or possibly other browsers. In the example of Internet Explorer, such content would be interpreted in the context of the Local Zone. Successful exploitation would still require the attacker to guess the local username of the victim.

This issue is reported to affect versions of the player for Microsoft Windows operating systems. Other versions may also be affected. Macromedia Director MX is similarly affected.

This issue affects versions of the player prior to 7.0.19.0.
