Sun ONE Application Server is prone to a source code disclosure vulnerability. This issue is due to handling of case in requests for resources. By changing the case of a file extension, the server may fail to interpret the script and instead serve it as a normal web resource.

This issue exists for Sun ONE Application Server 7.0 on Microsoft Windows platforms. Previous versions may also be affected.

GET /[script].JSP HTTP/1.0

where [script] is the name of a script hosted by the server.
