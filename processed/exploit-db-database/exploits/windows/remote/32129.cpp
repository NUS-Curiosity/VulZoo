BlazeVideo HDTV Player is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to handle malformed playlist files.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application or to trigger a denial-of-service condition.

BlazeVideo HDTV Player 3.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
