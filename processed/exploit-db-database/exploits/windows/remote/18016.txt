Background:

the mentioned program installs an ActiveX control with the following
settings:

ProgID: AUTOVUEX.AutoVueXCtrl.1
CLSID: {B6FCC215-D303-11D1-BC6C-0000C078797F}
Binary path: C:\PROGRA~1\av\avwin\AutoVueX.ocx
Safe for initialization (registry): true
Safe for scripting (registry): true

This control is marked "safe for scripting" and "safe for initialization",
Internet Explorer will allows scripting of this control.

Vulnerability:

The mentioned class contains the vulnerable SaveViewStateToFile() method, from
the typelib:

...
	/* DISPID=116 */
	/* VT_BOOL [11] */
	function SaveViewStateToFile(
		/* VT_BSTR [8]  */ $sFileName
		)
	{
	}
...

which allows to create / overwrite files with arbitrary extensions
inside arbitrary locations.

It was experimented that the content of theese files can be
partially controlled by passing a remote file to the
RestoreViewStateFromFile() method.

The resulting file will look like this:

   0 : 6b 00 00 00 07 00 41 56 31 37 5f 32 00 0a 00 56 [k.....AV17_2...V]
