Microsoft Excel is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability.

Attackers can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user to open a specially crafted Excel file.

Successful exploits can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.
