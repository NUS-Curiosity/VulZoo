File Transfer is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting this issue allows an attacker to access arbitrary files outside of the application's root directory. This can expose sensitive information that could help the attacker launch further attacks.

This issue affects versions prior to File Transfer 1.2f.
