VyPRESS Messenger is affected by a remote buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to verify the length of user-supplied strings prior to copying them into finite process buffers.

An attacker may leverage this issue to remotely execute arbitrary machine code on an affected computer with the privileges of the user running the affected application. It is possible to exploit all hosts on a local area network by sending a message to a broadcast address.
