A few years ago, I became aware of a security issue in most Call of Duty games.
Although I did not discover it myself, I thought it might be interesting to see what it could be used for.

Without going into detail, this security issue allows users playing a Call of Duty match to cause a buffer overflow on the host’s system inside a stack-allocated buffer within the game’s network handling.
In consquence, this allows full remote code execution!

The code has been published as the vulnerability used has been patched on all cod games as of 4/26/2018.
