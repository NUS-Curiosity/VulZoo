CA eTrust Security Command Center (eSCC) and eTrust Audit are prone to multiple vulnerabilities, including:

- an information-disclosure issue
- an arbitrary-file-deletion issue
- a replay issue.

These vulnerabilities occur because the software fails to validate user input and because of design errors in the way the software handles user permissions and secure data-transmission protocols.

An attacker may exploit these vulnerabilities to access sensitive information, delete arbitrary files with the permissions of the service account, and carry out external replay attacks.
