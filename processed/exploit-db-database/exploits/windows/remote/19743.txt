Cat Soft Serv-U 2.5/a/b,Windows 2000 Advanced Server/2000 Datacenter Server/2000 Professional/2000 Server/2000 Terminal Services/95/98/NT 4.0/NT Enterprise Server 4.0/NT Server 4.0/NT Terminal Server 4.0/NT Workstation 4.0 Shortcut Vulnerability

source: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/970/info

The Windows API that handles shortcut navigation is susceptible to buffer overflow attacks. The API, "SHGetPathFromIDList" will parse a shortcut file (.lnk) to find the target file, directory or URL. A specifically malformed link will cause any program using the API to follow that shortcut to crash.

NOTE: While this vulnerability listing, as well as the exploit and the original USSR advisory only mention Serv-U FTP server, any Windows, Microsoft, or 3rd party program that uses the API could be vulnerable to this.
