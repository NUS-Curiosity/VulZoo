Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a boundary condition error when handling OBJECT tags in web pages. When a web page containing an OBJECT tag using a parameter containing excessive data is encountered by a vulnerable client, a internal memory buffer will be overrun. This could cause Internet Explorer to fail or potentially result in the execution arbitrary code in the security context of the current user.
