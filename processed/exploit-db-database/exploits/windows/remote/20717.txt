Elron IM is a suite of tools providing internet filtering, virus protection, and other features.

Certain non-current versions of products in the Internet Manager suite, including IM Anti-Virus, are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.

An attacker can compose a long path which includes '/../' sequences, and submit it as a file request to the built-in webserver. The server will not filter 'dot-dot' sequences from the path, permitting the attacker to specify files outside the directory tree normally available to users.

This can permit disclosure of confidential data and sensitive system files which, if properly exploited, could lead to further compromises of the host's security.

http://target:80/../../../../../../boot.ini will, in most cases, return the specified file. In some cases, more "../" sequences will be required.
