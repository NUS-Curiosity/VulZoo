# Exploiting 'Non-Critical' Media Player Vulnerabilities for Fun and Profit
# By Matthew Murphy (mattmurphy@kc.rr.com)
#
# It's come to my attention that the HTML versions of the exploit posted on
# several sites have become mangled. Notables include SecuriTeam and FrSIRT.
# Neither one, though, can beat SecurityFocus, whose links to the exploits
# for this issue are both 404s.
#
# I haven't updated the underlying exploit methodology -- it's still a shameless
# rip of Skylined's heap spray technique, but now the shellcode can be
# customized!
#
# The usage of this tool is as follows:
#
# wmp-profiteer.pl [shellcode]
#
# The shellcode that comes with this has the same payload as the original.
# If it's successful against you, you'll have an administrator account named
# 'wmp0wn3d' with a password of 'password'. This, of course, assumes that
# you're running the vulnerable application as an administrator. There's a
# lesson in that: run as a Limited User or at least tie down your browsers
# with Software Restriction.
#
# This will drop 'wmp-exploit.html' in the current directory. When the HTML
# document is opened locally or viewed remotely by a vulnerable web browser
# (Firefox on Windows), the exploit code will run and gain control of the
# browser.
#
# The standard disclaimer from the original exploit still applies, with some
# changes:
#
# This exploit code is intended only as a demonstration tool for
# educational or testing purposes. It is not intended to be used for any
# unauthorized or illicit purpose. Any testing done with this tool OR ANY
# PRODUCT OR ALTERATION THEREOF must be limited to systems that you own or
# are explicitly authorized to test.
#
# By utilizing or possessing this code, you assume any and all
# responsibility for damage that results. The author will not be held
# responsible, under any circumstances, for damage that arises from your
# possession or use of this code.
