TFTP Server TFTPDWIN is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting this issue allows an attacker to gain read/write access to privileged directories and files.

TFTP Server TFTPDWIN 0.4.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
