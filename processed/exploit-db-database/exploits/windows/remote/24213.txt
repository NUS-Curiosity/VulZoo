Microsoft Internet Explorer is reported to contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability for sites that have a wildcard DNS entry.

A web server with a wildcard DNS entry will respond to any hostname requested. An example DNS entry of *.example.com would allow a hostname of whatevertheattackerwanted.example.com to properly resolve.

Internet Explorer improperly interprets text inside of an anchor tag as HTML, rather than plaintext.

To exploit this issue, an attacker must either find a preexisting web site using a wildcard DNS entry or create their own. The web site must also be configured to display the hostname received in the request in the HTML returned to the user. A remote attacker may exploit this issue to potentially execute HTML or script code in the security context of the vulnerable site.

An attacker can exploit this issue to steal cookie authentication credentials, or perform other types of attacks.
