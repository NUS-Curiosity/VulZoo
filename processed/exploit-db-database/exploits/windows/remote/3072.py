#Port bind exploit for apple quicktime rtsp vulnerability
#Tested on windows 2000 SP0 and SP4 with quicktime 7.1.3.100. Should be easy
#to port the exploit to others. All one needs to do is look for the appropriate
#jump address. Certain characters are not permitted in the shellcode.
#Alphanumeric shellcodes work fine.
#This script creates a qtl file which when clicked upon binds a shell to TCP
#port 4444. This file can be delivered through several means; HTTP, SMTP etc
#
# Winny Thomas ;-)
# Author shall bear no responsibility for any kind of screws up caused by using
# this code
