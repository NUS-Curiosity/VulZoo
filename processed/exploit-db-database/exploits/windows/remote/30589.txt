WinImage is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability and a directory-traversal vulnerability because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit these issues to cause a denial of service or to write malicious files to arbitrary directories.

WinImage 8.0 and 8.10 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
