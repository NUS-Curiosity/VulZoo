Microsoft Windows is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability because it opens help files from unsafe locations.

An attacker could exploit this issue by enticing a victim to load help files when working in a directory containing crafted '.chm' files.

Windows 2000 and XP are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
