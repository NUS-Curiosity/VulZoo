A buffer overrun vulnerability has been reported in Microsoft Windows that can be exploited remotely via a DCOM RPC interface that listens on TCP/UDP port 135. The issue is due to insufficient bounds checking of client DCOM object activation requests. Exploitation of this issue could result in execution of malicious instructions with Local System privileges on an affected system.

This issue may be exposed on other ports that the RPC Endpoint Mapper listens on, such as TCP ports 139, 135, 445 and 593. This has not been confirmed. Under some configurations the Endpoint Mapper may receive traffic via port 80.

** There have been unconfirmed reports that Windows 9x systems with certain software installed may also be vulnerable to this issue. Reportedly, Windows 98 systems with .NET software installed may be vulnerable according to scans using various DCOM RPC vulnerability scanning tools. Symantec has not confirmed this behaviour and it may in fact be due to false positives generated by the scanners.
