Apache is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability.

This issue occurs because Apache fails to properly associate file extensions with the correct engines when handling specially crafted requests for files on Windows SMB shares.

Attackers can leverage this issue to view arbitrary script files as plain text. Potentially sensitive information may be present in the script code. Information harvested could aid in further attacks.

This issue affects Apache 2.2.6 when serving PHP files from a Windows SMB share; other versions may also be affected.

NOTE: This issue may also occur when handling other filename extensions that use AddType directives to associate scripts or executables (e.g. '.cgi\', '.py\', '.rb\', etc.).
