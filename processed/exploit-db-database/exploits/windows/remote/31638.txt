HP OpenView Network Node Manager is prone to multiple vulnerabilities affecting the 'ovalarmsrv.exe' and 'ovtopmd.exe' processes. These issues include a directory-traversal issue and multiple denial-of-service issues.

UPDATE (April 14, 2008): Secunia Research discovered, independently, that the 'OpenView5.exe' process is also prone to the directory-traversal issue; this affects Network Node Manager 7.51. Note that 'ovalarmsrv.exe' may also be named 'OpenView5.exe'.

Attackers can exploit these issues to access potentially sensitive data on the affected computer or to deny service to legitimate users.

HP OpenView Network Node Manager 7.53 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
