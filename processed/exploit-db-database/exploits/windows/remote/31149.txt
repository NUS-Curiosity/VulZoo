Sentinel Protection Server and Keys Server are prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because the software fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input data.

Exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to access sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

This issue affects Protection Server 7.4.1.0 and Keys Server 1.0.4; earlier versions may also be vulnerable.

NOTE: This issue may be caused by an incomplete security patch released in November 2007 that was documented in BID 26583 ('Sentinel Protection Server/Keys Server Directory Traversal Vulnerability').
