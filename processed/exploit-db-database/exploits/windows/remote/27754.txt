+----------+
| OVERVIEW |
+----------+

The release of this advisory provides exploitation details in relation to a
known patched vulnerability in Oracle Java.   These details were obtained
through the Packet Storm Bug Bounty program and are being released to the
community.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------+
| DETAILS |
+---------+

The BytePackedRaster.verify()  method in Oracle Java versions prior to 7u25
is vulnerable to a signed integer overflow that allows bypassing of
"dataBitOffset" boundary checks.  This vulnerability allows for remote code
execution.  User interaction is required for this exploit in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
