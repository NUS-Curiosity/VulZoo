Reportedly an attacker may make a malicious HTTP request for specific P-Synch executables passing an empty URI parameter to trigger the condition. Although unconfirmed, it is likely that the request will cause P-Sync to display an error message containing the path to the executable.

This vulnerability was reported to affect P-Synch version 6.2.5 other versions may also be affected.
