asp2php is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is exposed when the application is used to convert an ASP file to PHP. The particular issue is related to parsing of tokens in ASP files. Since ASP files may originate from an external or untrusted source, this vulnerability is considered to be remote in nature.

Successful exploitation would allow for execution of arbitrary code in the context of the user running the application.
