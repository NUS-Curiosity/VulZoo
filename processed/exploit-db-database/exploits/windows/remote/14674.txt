RELEASE UPDATE 08/2010:
----------------------
This exploit was created almost a year ago and wasnt modified from that time
whatsoever. The vulnerability itself is patched for a long time already so
i have decided to release this little exploit. You use it for your own
responsibility and im not responsible for any potential damage this thing
can cause. Finally i don't care whether it worked for you or not.

P.S the technique itself is described here:
