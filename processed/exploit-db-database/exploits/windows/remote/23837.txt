It has been reported that Lotus Domino server may be prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to execute HTML or script code in a user's browser. The issue presents itself due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data via the 'Quick Console' function of 'webadmin.nsf' administrative interface.

IBM Lotus Domino server 6.5.1 has been reported to be prone to this issue, however, it is possible that other versions are affected as well.

1)Go to http://www.example.com/webadmin.nsf
2)Go to "server" tab
3)Go to "Quick console" in the left column
4)Give as "Domino command" <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
