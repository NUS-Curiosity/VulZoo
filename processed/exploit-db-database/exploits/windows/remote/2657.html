Secunia Advisory:   	SA22542
Release Date: 		2006-10-25
Impact: 		Spoofing
Solution Status: 	Unpatched
Software:		Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.x

Description:
A weakness has been discovered in Internet Explorer, which can be exploited by malicious
people to conduct phishing attacks.

The problem is that it's possible to display a popup with a somewhat spoofed address bar
where a number of special characters have been appended to the URL. This makes it possible
to only display a part of the address bar, which may trick users into performing certain
unintended actions.

Secunia has constructed a demonstration, which is available at:
http://secunia.com/internet_explorer_7_popup_address_bar_spoofing_test/

The weakness is confirmed in Internet Explorer 7 on a fully patched Windows XP SP2 system.

Solution:
Do not follow links from untrusted sources.

Provided and/or discovered by:
Discovered by an anonymous person.
