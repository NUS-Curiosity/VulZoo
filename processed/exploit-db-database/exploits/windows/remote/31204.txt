Sophos Email Appliance is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities that affect its web interface because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Please note that potential exploits will likely target privileged users.

These issues affect versions prior to Sophos Email Appliance 2.1.1.0.
