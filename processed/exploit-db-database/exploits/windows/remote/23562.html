It has been reported that the software is allegedly prone to a directory traversal vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to access information outside the server root directory. This issue is reported to exist in the 'wralogin' authentication form that is accessed through the HTTPS (SSL) interface.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information that may be used to launch further attacks against a vulnerable system.

All versions of 2Wire HomePortal Series have been reported to be vulnerable to this issue.
