SolarWinds TFTP Server is distributed for the Microsoft Windows platform.

The SolarWinds TFTP Server does not properly handle user-supplied input. Due to insufficient handling of user input, it is possible for a remote user to request arbitrary files from the vulnerable server. It would be possible for a remote user to download any files readable through the permissions of the TFTP Server user.
