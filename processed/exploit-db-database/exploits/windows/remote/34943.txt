Project Jug is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to read files outside the webroot directory. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

Project Jug 1.0.0.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
