Panda ActiveScan is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Panda ActiveScan version 5.53.00 is affected by this issue; other versions may also be affected.

This BID is being retired because the application is a service and cannot be downloaded.
