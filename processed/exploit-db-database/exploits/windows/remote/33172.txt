Source Engine is prone to a format-string vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before passing it as the format specifier to a formatted-printing function.

An attacker may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in a denial-of-service condition.

Source Engine 3968 and prior builds are affected.
