Apple QuickTime is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because of a failure to properly bounds-check user-supplied data.

Successful exploits will allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently logged-in user; failed exploit attempts may cause denial-of-service conditions.

QuickTime 7.6.9 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
