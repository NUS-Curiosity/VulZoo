AceFTP is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue allows an attacker to write arbitrary files to locations outside of the application's current directory. This could help the attacker launch further attacks.

AceFTP Freeware 3.80.3 and AceFTP Freeware 3.80.3 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
