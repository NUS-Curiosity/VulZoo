It has been reported that Lotus Domino may be prone to a directory traversal vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to access information outside the server root directory. The issue reportedly exists in the server's administrative interface accessed via 'webadmin.nsf'. The vulnerability may be exploited by a remote attacker by traversing outside the server root directory by using '../' directory traversal character sequences. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information and/or modify the underlying file system.

IBM Lotus Domino server 6.5.1 has been reported to be prone to this issue, however, it is possible that other versions are affected as well.
