CProxy is reported prone to a remote directory traversal vulnerability. This issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. A remote user may exploit this issue to disclose arbitrary files and carry out a denial of service condition.

It is reported that an attacker can simply issue an HTTP GET request including directory traversal sequences to carry out this attack.

GET http://../../[file] HTTP/1.0
