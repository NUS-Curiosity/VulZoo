SnapStream PVS Lite is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this issue by enticing a victim user to follow a malicious link to a system hosting the software that contains embedded HTML and script code. The embedded code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user.

This could be exploited to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from legitimate users. Other attacks are also possible.
