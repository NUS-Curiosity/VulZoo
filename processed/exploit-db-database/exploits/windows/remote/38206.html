Samsung Kies is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly validate user-supplied input before copying it into a fixed-length buffer.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks may cause a denial-of-service condition.
