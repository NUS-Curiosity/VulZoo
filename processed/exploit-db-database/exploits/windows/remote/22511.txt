BadBlue is prone to a vulnerability that could allow remote attackers to gain unauthorized access. This is due to an input validation issue in the 'ext.dll' component that could allow a remote attacker to cause '.hts' files to be interpreted by the server. This could lead to unauthorized execution of administrative commands.
