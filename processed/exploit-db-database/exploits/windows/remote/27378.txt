Easy File Sharing Web Server is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

The issues include HTML-injection, denial-of-service, and arbitrary file-upload vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is rendered to the user, cause the application to crash, and facilitate a compromise of the underlying computer.
