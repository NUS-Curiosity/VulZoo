Crystal Reports and Crystal Enterprise Web Form Viewer is prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. This issue can allow an attacker to retrieve and delete files, allowing for information disclosure and denial of service attacks.

An attacker can exploit this issue by sending directory traversal sequences and requesting a file through a vulnerable parameter of one of the affected modules.

Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003, Outlook 2003 with Business Contact Manager, and Business Solutions CRM 1.2 are also vulnerable to this issue as Microsoft re-distributes Crystal Reports.
