Photodex ProShow Producer is prone to multiple arbitrary code-execution vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit these issues by enticing a legitimate user to use the vulnerable application to open a customized library file from application path which contains a specially crafted code. Successful exploits will compromise the application in the context of the currently logged-in user.

Photodex ProShow Producer 5.0.3297 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

    if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
    {
        MessageBox(0,"DLL Injection","DLL Injection", 0);
    }
return TRUE;
