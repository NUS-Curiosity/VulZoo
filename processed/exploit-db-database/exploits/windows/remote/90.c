/*
 * eMule/xMule/LMule OP_SERVERMESSAGE Format String Vulnerability
 * (SecurityFocus BID 8443)
 * proof of concept code
 * version 1.0 (Aug 29 2003)
 *
 * by Rémi Denis-Courmont
 *
 * This vulnerability was found by:
 *   Stefan Esser <s.esser@e-matters.de>
 * whose original advisory may be fetched from:
 *   http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/022003.html
 *
 * Vulnerable:
 *  - eMule v0.29c -> wait for server connection timeout (!?! I need help !?!)
 *  - xMule stable v1.4.3 -> crash
 *  - xMule unstable v1.5.6a -> crash
 *  - Lmule v1.3.1 (NOT tested) -> ???
 *
 *   There is something wrong with eMule 0.29c (exception handling) and it
 * refuses to crash.
 *
 * Not vulnerable:
 *  - xMule stable v1.6.0,
 *  - eMule v0.30a.
 *
 *   As a format string vulnerability over a possibly large format input
 * buffer, experienced assembly coders (ie. NOT me) should be able to exploit
 * this vulnerability (you can find as much as 2 mega-bytes available in the
 * stack in the socket input buffer, and the message is also duplicated on
 * the heap and can be as long as 65535 bytes). However, getting clients to
 * connect to while not impossible, will be very very hard: Even though many
 * clients adds current server of other clients to their own server lists, so
 * that you can promote yourself as a server by actively connecting to others,
 * it is unlikely that your "server" will be selected from the list which
 * often exceeds 100 entries.
 *   Anyway, the following proof-of-concept is entirely passive, so you will
 * probably only be able to test it against yourself (which is very fine,
 * because you usually are you only legal victim).
