eFileGo is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to retrieve arbitrary files, upload files to arbitrary locations, cause denial of service conditions and execute arbitrary commands.

Successful exploitation may facilitate a remote compromise of the computer running the affected software.
