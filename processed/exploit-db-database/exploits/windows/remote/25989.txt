Winamp is susceptible to a buffer overflow vulnerability in its ID3v2 functionality. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly bounds check input data prior to copying it into a fixed size memory buffer.

This issue will facilitate remote exploitation as an attacker may distribute malicious MP3 files and entice unsuspecting users to process them with the affected application.

An attacker may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user that activated the vulnerable application.

Versions 5.03a, 5.09, and 5.091 are reported vulnerable to this issue. Other versions are also likely affected.
