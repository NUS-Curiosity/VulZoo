ICQ is an instant messenger client for Microsoft Windows systems. ICQ includes support for sound schemes. ICQ sound scheme files are generally given the .scm extension.

Reportedly, it is possible for a remote party to modify sound settings in ICQ by forcing a vulnerable user to access a blank .scm file. Allegedly, this may be done if the user views maliciously formatted HTML under some browsers. The HTML must reference a sound scheme file within an IFRAME tag.
