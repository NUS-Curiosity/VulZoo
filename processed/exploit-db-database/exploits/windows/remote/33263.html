The EMC Captiva PixTools Distributed Imaging ActiveX control is prone to multiple insecure-method vulnerabilities that affect the PDIControl.PDI.1 ActiveX control (PDIControl.dll).

Successfully exploiting these issues allows remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary local files, which may lead to arbitrary code execution.

PDIControl.dll 2.2.3160.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
