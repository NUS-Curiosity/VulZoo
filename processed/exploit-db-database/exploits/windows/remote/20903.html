Internet Explorer contains a flaw which could enable a remote web site operator to retrieve a known file from a visiting user's system.

If a specially formed script containing GetObject function with the known path to an existing file is embedded on a web page. Once the target user opens the web page, IE will return the contents of the file back to the web server.

It may be possible to execute arbitrary commands, although it has not been confirmed.
