Reportedly the BitDefender AvxScanOnlineCtrl COM object is affected by a file upload and execution vulnerability. This issue is due to a design error that allows a remote user to specify a file to be uploaded and executed on a system running the affected software.

This issue may be leveraged by a remote attacker to upload and execute arbitrary files on an affected system; most likely resulting in unauthorized access. Other attackers are also possible.
