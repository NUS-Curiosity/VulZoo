Xbmc get tag from file name request remote buffer overflow 8.10 !!!

Tested:Win xp sp2 eng
Vendor url:http://xbmc.org/

versions affected:
Linux windows < tested
other versions are also possibly affected.
Release date:April the 1st 2009

Restrictions:No filtering needed.
This exploit happens when parsing and overly long id3
tag to the web server.Dont think i covered this much
in the poc code as i was running out of time on this
exploit.


We are able to overwrite the exception handlers also so
creating a reliable exploit for vista and xps3 shouldn't
be to hard have a look there are some modules loaded with
out /safe seh.

Credits to n00b for finding the buffer overflow and writing
poc code and exploit.
