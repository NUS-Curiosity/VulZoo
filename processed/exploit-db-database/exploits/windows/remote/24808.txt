A remote URI obfuscation vulnerability has been found in Internet Explorer's search pane functionality. This issue is due to a failure of the application to present the URI address of HTML and script code loaded into the search pane.

This issue may be leveraged by an attacker to display misleading information in the address bar of the browser to an unsuspecting user while loading a third party Web site in the search pane. This may allow an attacker to present web pages to users that seem to originate from a trusted location. This may facilitate phishing style attacks; other attacks may also be possible.
