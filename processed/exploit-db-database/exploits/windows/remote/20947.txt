1C: Arcadia Internet Store is a online shopping utility for Microsoft Windows NT/2000 that is fully integratable with 1C: Enterprise, another popular Russian web-commerce utility.

One of the components of this package, 'tradecli.dll', allows users to specify a template file, the contents of which will be output. There is no filtering on '..\' character sequences. As a result, remote users can specify an arbitrary file on the same drive as the webserver by 'traversing' outside of the web root directory.

This vulnerability may disclose sensitive information to attackers.

Exploit: http://host/script/tradecli.dll?template=..\..\..\..\..\path\to\file
