A remote command execution vulnerability affects HP OpenView Radia Management Portal. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly secure access to critical functionality. This is due to a directory traversal issue that will permit a remote user to execute any program on the affected computer.

An unauthenticated, remote attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary commands on an affected computer with Local System privileges on the Microsoft Windows platform and elevated privileges on UNIX-based platforms.
