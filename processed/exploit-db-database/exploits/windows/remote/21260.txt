Microsoft Site Server is designed to run on Microsoft Windows NT Server
platforms. It provides a means for users on a corporate intranet to
share, publish, and find information. Site Server Commerce Edition
incorporates the same features as well as providing an interface for
e-commerce sites to interact and conduct business with customers and
suppliers.

Various Microsoft Site Server ASP pages are prone to cross-site scripting attacks. It is possible to create a malicious link to a vulnerable ASP page which contains arbitrary script code. Script code will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user who browses the link, in the context of the Microsoft Site Server site.

The vulnerable pages require that the legitimate user authenticates before accessing them.

At the very least this may provide an opportunity for an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from a legitimate Microsoft Site Server user.

Default.asp and formslogin.asp are known to be prone to this issue. It has been reported that a number of other ASP pages are also affected.
