A remote user can gain read and write access on a target machine running Carello shopping cart software.

First, a user may create a duplicate of a known file in a known directory on the target host through add.exe in /scripts/Carello. Accessing http://target/scripts/Carello/add.exe?C:\directory\filename.ext will generate a duplicate file with a "1" appended to the filename (eg. filename.ext1). From here, the remote user would perform a http request of the newly created duplicate file and be able to view the contents of it.

This vulnerability depends on the anonymous internet account having write access to the relevant directories.
