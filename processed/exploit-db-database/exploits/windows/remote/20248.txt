Smartwin Technology CyberOffice Shopping Cart is a shopping cart application for e-commerce enabled websites running Windows NT 4.0 or 2000.

It is possible for a remote user to gain read access to the _private directory on a website running CyberOffice Shopping Cart 2.0. By default the _private directory has world readable permissions. The Microsoft Access Database which contains confidential client details (such as customer orders and unencrypted credit card information) is stored in the _private directory and is thus accessible to attackers. An attacker need only request "http://target/_private/shopping_cart.mdb" with a browser to access it.
