Publish-It Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Publish-It Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2014-0001
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/publish-it-buffer-overflow-vulnerability
Date published: 2014-02-05
Date of last update: 2014-02-05
Vendors contacted: Poster Software
Release mode: User release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2014-0980


3. *Vulnerability Description*

Publish-It [1] is prone to a (client side) security vulnerability when
processing .PUI files. This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine, by enticing
the user of Publish-It to open a specially crafted .PUI file.


4. *Vulnerable Packages*

 . Publish-It v3.6d for Win XP.
 . Publish-It v3.6d for Win 7.
 . Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

There was no official answer from vendor after several attempts to
report this vulnerability (see [Sec. 8]). As mitigation action, given
that this is a client-side vulnerability, avoid to open untrusted .PUI
files. Contact vendor for further information.


6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Daniel Kazimirow
from Core Exploit Writers Team.


7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Below is shown the result of opening the Proof of concept file [2] on
Windows XP SP3 (EN).

The arbitrary value 0x04040404 is stored in the EIP register where our
shellcode starts (just a software breakpoint 0xCC):

/-----
04040404    CC              INT3
04040405    CC              INT3
04040406    CC              INT3
04040407    CC              INT3
04040408    CC              INT3
04040409    CC              INT3

0404040B    CC              INT3

As a result, the normal execution flow can be altered in order to
execute arbitrary code.
