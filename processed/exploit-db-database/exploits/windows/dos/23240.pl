A vulnerability has been reported to exist in the mIRC client that may allow a remote attacker to crash a vulnerable mIRC client. The condition is most likely present due to insufficient boundary checking performed on 'DCC SEND' requests.

It has been reported that when received, a malicious 'DDC SEND' request can trigger a fatal error and cause an affected mIRC client to crash.
