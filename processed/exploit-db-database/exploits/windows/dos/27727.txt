Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a memory-corruption vulnerability. This issue is due to a flaw in the application in handling nested OBJECT tags in HTML content.

An attacker could exploit this issue via a malicious web page to potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently logged-in user, but this has not been confirmed. Exploit attempts likely result in crashing the affected application. Attackers could exploit this issue through HTML email/newsgroup postings or through other applications that employ the affected component.

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 for Microsoft Windows XP SP2 is reportedly vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
