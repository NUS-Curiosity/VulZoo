Trend Micro OfficeScan Corporate Edition is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability and a denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

Successful exploits may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user running the application. This may facilitate a complete compromise of vulnerable computers. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

These issues affect the following:

OfficeScan Corporate Edition 8.0 Patch 2 Build 1189 and earlier
OfficeScan Corporate Edition 7.0 Patch 3 Build 1314 and earlier

Other Trend Micro products may also be affected.
