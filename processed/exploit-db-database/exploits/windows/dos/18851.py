# Guitar Pro 6.1.1 r10791 (.gpx) Crash POC
# found by condis
#
# Date      : 01 May 2012 AD
# Tested on : Windows XP Professional SP3 PL
#
# Description :
#
# Each load of malformated file into the program ends up
# with crash, but place of crash and registers values
# differ every time o_O"
#
# In my opinion, this bug does not allow for anything else
# except getting to a DoS situation, therefore no further
# research was done.
