OmniHTTPD is a web-server offered by Omnicron for the MS Windows platform. One of the CGI utilities it ships with and installs by default contains a bug that could, if exploited, lead to a denial of service condition on host it runs on. When the "visiadmin.exe" program is executed via CGI with the argument "user=guest", it creates temporary files until the hard drive fills. The files then need to be manually removed before anything can be written to the disk. The technical reasons for this behaviour are not known.
