The orakill utility is provided with Oracle databases on Windows platforms. The executable (orakill.exe) is available to DBAs to kill Oracle
sessions directly from the DOS command line without requiring any connection to the database.

  where sid  = the Oracle instance to target
        thread = the thread id of the thread to kill

  The thread id should be retrieved from the spid column of a query such as:

        select spid, osuser, s.program from
        v$process p, v$session s where p.addr=s.paddr
