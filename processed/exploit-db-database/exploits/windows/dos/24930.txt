4.4 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:P/RL:U/RC:C)


Details:
=======
Vulnerability Description : Groovy media player is vulnerable to buffer overflow vulnerability.The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.Certain languages allow direct addressing of memory locations and do not automatically ensure that these locations are valid for the memory buffer that is being referenced. This can cause read or write operations to be performed on memory locations that may be associated with other variables, data structures, or internal program data.

Impact : Groovy Media Player is prone to a local buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input. Specifically, this issue occurs when opening a '.m3u' playlist file that contains excessive data.

Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Caveats / Prerequisites:
======================

The attacker needs to entice victims to perform an action in order to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof Of Concept:
================


POC Exploit code:

# !/usr/bin/python

filename = "Evil.m3u"
# Exploit-DB Note: fixed file extension as original script created a MP3
# instead of M3U

buffer = "\x41" * 220
exploit = buffer

textfile = open(filename , 'w')
textfile.write(exploit)
textfile.close()


Risk:
=====

The security risk of the Local Buffer Overflow Vulnerability is estimated as moderate.

Any modified copy or reproduction, including partially usages, of this file requires authorization from Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team. Permission to electronically redistribute this alert in its unmodified form is granted. All other rights, including the use of other media, are reserved by Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team.


The first attempt at contact will be through any appropriate contacts or formal mechanisms listed on the vendor Web site, or by sending an e-mail with the pertinent information about the vulnerability. Simultaneous with the vendor being notified, Cyberoam may distribute vulnerability protection filters to its customers' IPS devices through the IPS upgrades.

If a vendor fails to respond after five business days, Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team may issue a public advisory disclosing its findings fifteen business days after the initial contact.

If a vendor response is received within the timeframe outlined above, Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team will allow the vendor 6-months to address the vulnerability with a patch. At the end of the deadline if a vendor is not responsive or unable to provide a reasonable statement as to why the vulnerability is not fixed, the Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team will publish a limited advisory to enable the defensive community to protect the user. We believe that by doing so the vendor will understand the responsibility they have to their customers and will react appropriately.

Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team will make every effort to work with vendors to ensure they understand the technical details and severity of a reported security flaw. If a product vendor is unable to, or chooses not to, patch a particular security flaw, Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team will offer to work with that vendor to publicly disclose the flaw with some effective workarounds.

Before public disclosure of a vulnerability, Cyberoam Vulnerability Research Team may share technical details of the vulnerability with other security vendors who are in a position to provide a protective response to a broader user base.
