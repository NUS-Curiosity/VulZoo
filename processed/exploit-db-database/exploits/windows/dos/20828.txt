Spynet Chat Server is a freely available client-server chat package by Spytech Software. Spynet Chat offers IRC style chat to users of the software package.

A problem in the package could allow remote users to crash the chat server. Upon receiving 100 connection requests from a host within a short period of time, and then receiving a message from same host via the chat client, the chat server exits abnormally. A manual restart is required to resume service.

This problem makes it possible for remote users to crash a Spynet Chat Server, denying service to legimate users.
