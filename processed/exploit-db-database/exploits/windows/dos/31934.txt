Microsoft Word is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this issue by enticing a victim to open and interact with malicious Word files.

Successfully exploiting this issue will corrupt memory and crash the application. Given the nature of this issue, attackers may also be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently logged-in user.
