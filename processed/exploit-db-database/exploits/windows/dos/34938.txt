Teamspeak is prone to a memory-corruption vulnerability.

Attackers can exploit this issue by sending a specially crafted voice transmission packet containing malicious data.

Successful exploits can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Teamspeak version 2.0.32.60 is vulnerable.

The following proof-of-concept packet is available:
