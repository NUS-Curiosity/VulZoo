WFTPD Pro is prone to multiple remote denial-of-service vulnerabilities because the application fails to handle specially crafted FTP commands in a proper manner.

Attackers can exploit these issues to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users.

WFTPD Pro 3.30.0.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

UPDATE (January 29, 2009): This issue is reported to affect only servers that have the 'Enable Security' configuration option disabled.
