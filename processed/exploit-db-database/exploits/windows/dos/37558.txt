Incorrect theme file parsing, that leads to crash.

-Create a .xml file with numbereous "A" (around 1000) in it and save as
test.xml
-Go to this directory in windows  "/appdata/roaming/notepad++/themes/" and
paste above test.xml file in this theme folder and restart notepad++
-Now start notepad++ and in menu tab, go in settings and then select style
configurator and now select test file in theme select option
-Now hit "save and close" button, it will crash with an error message
