It has been reported that Palmhttpd server may be prone to remote denial of service vulnerability, when an attacker attempts to establish multiple connections with the software. This issue occurs because PalmOS can only handle one client connection.

Shaun2k2 Palmhttpd version 3.0 and prior may be prone to this issue. Since the application is an extension of 'httpd for PalmOS' server by Jim Rees, it is assumed that 'httpd for PalmOS' is vulnerable as well, however, this product has been discontinued.
