Elecard MPEG Player is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

Attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Elecard MPEG Player 5.8 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
