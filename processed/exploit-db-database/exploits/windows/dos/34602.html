Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a cross-domain information-disclosure vulnerability because the application fails to enforce the same-origin policy.

An attacker can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user into viewing a page containing malicious content.

Successful exploits will allow attackers to bypass the same-origin policy and obtain potentially sensitive information; other attacks are possible.

This issue affects Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8.
