Multiple applications are prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability by presenting malicious 'WMV', 'MID', and 'AVI' files to a victim user. When an affected application processes this image, the application crashes, effectively denying service.

It is not known at this time if this issue can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code; this BID will be updated as further information becomes available.
