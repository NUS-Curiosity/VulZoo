Multiple FUN labs games are affected by remote denial of service vulnerabilities.

A remote attacker can cause a game server to stop responding by sending an empty UDP packet.

Another vulnerability can allow a remote attacker to send a malformed join packet and crash the server.

These issues can be exploited to cause a denial of service condition in the server.
