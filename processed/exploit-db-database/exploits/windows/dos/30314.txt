Yahoo! Messenger is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application or to cause denial-of-service conditions.

Yahoo! Messenger 8.1 and prior versions are vulnerable.
