Apple Safari for Windows is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to properly handle user-supplied input.

An attacker may exploit this issue by enticing victims into opening a maliciously crafted HTML document.

Successful exploits can allow attackers to crash the affected browser, resulting in denial-of-service conditions. Attackers may also be able to execute arbitrary code, but Symantec had not confirmed this.

Safari 3.0.1 public beta for Windows is reported vulnerable.
