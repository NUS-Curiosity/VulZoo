Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to an unspecified denial of service vulnerability in the JPEG image rendering library used by the browser. This issue is reportedly similar to the one described in BID 14282.

This issue was identified by creating random input for the browser, and has not been researched further at this time. This BID will be updated as further information is disclosed.

Successful exploitation results in crashing the affected Web browser. It may be possible that execution of arbitrary code may also be achieved, but this has not been confirmed.
