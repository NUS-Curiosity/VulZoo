Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to handle exceptional conditions.

This issue is triggered when an attacker entices a victim user to visit a malicious website.

Remote attackers may exploit this issue to crash Internet Explorer, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

Internet Explorer 6 and 7 are vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
