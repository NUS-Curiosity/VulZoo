// DAP comes with an old version, but the last from jcomsoft is also vulnerable:
// there's a stack-based buffer overflow in the ReadGIF and ReadGIF2 methods,
// the funny thing is that after the first exception that will be handled by IE,
// when the object is released we reach RtlpCoalesceFreeBlocks owning eax and ecx
// with windogs xp sp1 or the second check of safe-unlink with sp2 in a standard heap
// overflow scenario.
