Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability. This issue occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to execute certain JavaScript code.

Successfully exploiting this issue will cause the affected application to crash, denying service to legitimate users. Code execution may potentially be possible, but this has not been confirmed.

Internet Explorer 6 and 7 are vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
