A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in the Sambar web server. The issue is due to a boundary condition error in the POST data processing of the affected software.

Immediate consequences of an attack may result in a denial of service condition. It may also be possible for the attacker to manipulate process memory and execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable process.
