#Intellicom 'NetBiterConfig.exe' is prone to a remote stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.
#
#Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.
#

# Intellicom NetBiterConfig.exe 1.3.0 Remote Stack Overwrite.
