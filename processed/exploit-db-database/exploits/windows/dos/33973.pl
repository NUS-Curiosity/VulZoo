Hyplay is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability.

Attackers may leverage this issue to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users. Given the nature of this issue, the attacker may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

Hyplay 1.2.0326.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
