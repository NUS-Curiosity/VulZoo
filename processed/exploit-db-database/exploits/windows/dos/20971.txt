===============
1) Introduction
===============

Adobe Photoshop is a graphics editing program developed and published by Adobe Systems Incorporated.
Adobe's 2003 "Creative Suite" rebranding led to Adobe Photoshop 8's renaming to Adobe Photoshop CS.
Thus, Adobe Photoshop CS6 is the 13th major release of Adobe Photoshop. The CS rebranding also resulted
in Adobe offering numerous software packages containing multiple Adobe programs for a reduced price.
Adobe Photoshop is released in two editions: Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Photoshop Extended, with the
Extended having extra 3D image creation, motion graphics editing, and advanced image analysis features.[6]
Adobe Photoshop Extended is included in all of Adobe's Creative Suite offerings except Design Standard,
which includes the Adobe Photoshop edition. Alongside Photoshop and Photoshop Extended, Adobe also
publishes Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Lightroom, collectively called "The Adobe Photoshop Family".
In 2008, Adobe released Adobe Photoshop Express, a free web-based image editing tool to edit photos directly
on blogs and social networking sites; in 2011 a version was released for the Android operating system and the
iOS operating system.[7][8] Adobe only supports Windows and Macintosh versions of Photoshop, but using Wine,
Photoshop CS6 can run well on Linux

============================
3) Technical details
============================
The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the "Standart MultiPlugin.8BF" module
when processing a Portable Network Graphics (PNG) image. This can be exploited to cause
a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted "tRNS" chunk size. Successful exploitation
may allow execution of arbitrary code, but requires tricking a user into opening a malicious image.
