Edraw Diagram Component ActiveX control ('EDBoard.ocx') is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application, usually Internet Explorer, using the ActiveX control. Failed attacks will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

Edraw Diagram Component 5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
