Microsoft .NET Framework SDK contains tools for assembling and disassembling MSIL files. These tools are prone to buffer-overflow vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.

These issues were reported to affect the .NET Framework SDK version 1.1 SP1; earlier versions may also be affected. Version 2.0 may also be affected, but code execution does not seem possible.
