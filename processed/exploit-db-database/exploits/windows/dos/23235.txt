OpenOffice provides functionality so that it can be configured to listen on a designated network port for incoming communications.

OpenOffice is prone to a remote denial of service vulnerability under certain circumstances. The issue presents itself when an attacker connects to a remote OpenOffice session and transmits malicious data to the affected software. The software will apparently fail when handling the malicious data.
