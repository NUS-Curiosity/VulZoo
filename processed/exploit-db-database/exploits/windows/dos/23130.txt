It has been reported that Gordano Messaging Suite may be prone to a denial of service issue allowing a remote attacker to send malformed HTTP GET requests to cause the WWW.exe process to crash.

The problme may lead to the termination of services such as Administration, WebMail Professional, WebMail Express, WebMail Mobile, Instant Messaging, and Web Server services, which are provided by the WWW.exe process.

It should be noted that only the WWW.exe process on a Windows system will crash under this condition, on Linux the connection will simply hang without timing out.
