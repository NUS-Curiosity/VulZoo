# Risk: Medium

#Description:
#Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages.
#Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.
#Based on the powerful editing component Scintilla, Notepad++ is written in C++ and uses pure Win32 API and STL which ensures a higher execution speed
#and smaller program size. By optimizing as many routines as possible without losing user friendliness, Notepad++ is trying to reduce the world carbon
#dioxide emissions. When using less CPU power, the PC can throttle down and reduce power consumption, resulting in a greener environment.
