It is reported that Convex 3D is susceptible to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly check the bounds of user-supplied image data prior to copying it into a fixed-size memory buffer.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to alter the proper flow of execution of the application, potentially resulting in the execution of attacker-supplied machine code in the context of the application attempting to read a malicious file.
