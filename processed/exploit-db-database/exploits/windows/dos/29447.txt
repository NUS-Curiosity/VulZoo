WinZip is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to adequately bounds-check user-supplied input before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

An attacker may exploit this issue to cause denial-of-service conditions and possibly to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application, but this has not been confirmed.

This issue affects versions prior to 9.0 SR1.
