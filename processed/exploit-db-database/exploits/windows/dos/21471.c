ServletExec/ISAPI is a plug-in Java Servlet/JSP engine for Microsoft IIS. It runs with IIS on Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP systems.

A denial of service condition occurs when the JSPServlet is sent an overly long request either directly or via a request for a JSP file.

It has been reported that this will cause the underlying webserver to crash.

This condition may be the result of insufficient bounds checking, though this possibility has not been confirmed.

/*    This is Exploit code for a vulnerability in NewAtlanta ServletExec ISAPI 4.1.
      ServletExec 4.1 ISAPI is a Java Servlet/JSP Engine for Internet Information
      Server and is implemented as an ISAPI filter.
      Machines running this program is MS IIS server 4 and 5.
	  This code can simple crash the server, successfully preform a DoS attack!
	  It sends a string that servletExec don't like but have to eat, and
	  this will make the server crash, BIG TIME =)
	  This file assuming the www server is on port 80 and that the servlet engine
	  is located in the /Servlet directory.
	  Jonas "bl0wfi5h" Nyberg and Digital-Root.com is proud to present ServletExecCrash.
	  You can contact me at: bl0wfi5h@digital-root.com or bl0wfi5h@hotmail.com.
