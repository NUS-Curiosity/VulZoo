The M3U Playlist file parser in NullSoft Winamp does not perform proper bounds checking with the extension "#EXTINF:". Therefore, entering a string consisting of over 280 characters in conjunction with this parameter will cause a buffer overflow condition which will either crash the application or allow for arbitrary code to be executed, depending on the data entered.

Cut and paste the following into a M3U file:

EXTM3U
#EXTINF:<string of of over 280 characters>
