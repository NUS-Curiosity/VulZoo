WebView WebMail-Client is an add-on for the Mercur SMTP/POP3/IMAP4 Mail Server which allows a user to access email through a web browser.

Insufficient boundary checking exists in the code which handles GET requests, specifically on port 1080. Issuing a GET request containing a string of over 1000 characters on port 1080 will cause the WebView WebMail-Client application to crash.

eg.
http: //target/&mail_user=<string containing over 1000 characters>
