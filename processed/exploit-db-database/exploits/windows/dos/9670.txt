# Part Description :
--------------------
Description Program
FotoTagger is a free software tool for annotating JPEG images quickly and easily.
Place on an image location-specific annotation notes that point to people or other elements.
Identify people and objects. Mark notable details. Comment specific objects. Instantly
find a particular person, object, or comment among image collections. Do you use Flickr?
Annotate pictures with FotoTagger and upload them to your Flickr account in a few seconds.
FotoTagger annotations are preserved and converted to Flickr notes so you can edit them by
using Flickr online tools. You can also download images from Flickr with Flickr notes
transformed to FotoTagger annotations and edit them with FotoTagger! Multiple image upload
and download are supported. You can also enjoy other means for sharing annotated images.
FotoTagger lets you publish annotated pictures to blogs at Blogger.com and LiveJournal,
as well as share annotated images through Web and email. Annotations do not change an
original image so moving and sharing files keep annotations intact.
