Microsoft Excel is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability.

Attackers can exploit this issue to deny access to legitimate users. Given the nature of this vulnerability, attackers may also be able to execute arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

Microsoft Excel 2007 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
