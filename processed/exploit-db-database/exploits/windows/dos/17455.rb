			'Description'	=> %q{
				This module triggers unauthenticated Denial-of-Service condition in SmallFTPD server versions 1.0.3-fix and earlier with a few dozens of connection requests. The vulnerability is probably conerned with smallftpd being unable to handle multiple connections regardless of its maximum connection settings. Upon successful DoS exploit, the smallftpd will crash or still seem functioning by showing its service banner. But in fact it stops denying new FTP  requests, which can be verified only through a valid login.
