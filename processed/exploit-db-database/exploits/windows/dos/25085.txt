A remote buffer overflow vulnerability affects Microsoft Office XP. The problem presents itself when an unsuspecting user follows a malicious HTML link that points to a Office document. A boundary condition error is exposed during this operation that may allow attacker-specified data to corrupt process memory.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of an unsuspecting user that follows a malicious embedded link.
