WebReflex is a software package designed to operate a HTTP server off a cdrom, providing web hosting on Microsoft Windows systems. It is written and maintained by Sapio Design Ltd.

A problem with the software could allow a denial of service to legitimate users. By issuing an excessively long HTTP GET request to the web server, the server becomes unstable and exits with a General Protection Fault. It may also be possible to execute arbitrary code, although this claim is unverified.

It is possible for a malicious remote user may take advantage of this vulnerability to deny service to legitimate users.
