Winace is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

Attackers can exploit this issue to crash Windows Explorer, denying service to legitimate users. Given the nature of this issue, attackers may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

Winace 2.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
