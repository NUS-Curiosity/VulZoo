A buffer-overflow vulnerability has been discovered in Kerio Personal Firewall. The problem occurs during the administration authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by forging a malicious packet containing an excessive data size. The application then reads this data into a static memory buffer without first performing sufficient bounds checking.

Successful exploits of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a target system, with the privileges of the firewall.

Note that this vulnerability affects Kerio Personal Firewall 2.1.4 and earlier.
