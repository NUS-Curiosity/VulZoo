Symantec Norton Internet Security 2003 is reported to be prone to a denial of service condition.

It is possible to trigger this condition by sending an excessive (approximately 65500 or more) number of ICMP packets to a host running Norton Internet Security. This may cause a denial of service and possible system instability.

For this issue to be present remotely, the software must be configured to allow ICMP packets and the firewall must be enabled. Otherwise, it is possible to trigger this condition locally.

It is not known if earlier versions of the software are also affected by this vulnerability.
