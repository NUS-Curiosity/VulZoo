# SUMMARY:
# AT-TFTP Server is a Freeware TFTP server for Windows 9x/NT/XP.
# (http://www.alliedtelesyn.co.uk/en-gb/support/downloads/tools.asp)
# It provides an implementation of the TFTPv2 protocol.
# A vulnerability has been identified in TFTP Server AT-TFTP Server v1.9, which
# could be exploited by remote or local attackers to execute arbitrary commands
# or cause a denial of service. This flaw is due to a buffer overflow error when
# handling an overly long file name (more than 227 bytes) passed to a "GET" or "PUT"
# command, which could be exploited by malicious users to compromise a vulnerable
# system or crash an affected application.
# EXPLOIT:
# Buffer Overflow (Long filename) Vulnerability Exploit
# This is just a DoS exploiting code
# Tested on Windows xp SP2
#
# Requires python and impacket
#
