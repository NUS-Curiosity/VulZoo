The 'shlwapi.dll' dynamic link library causes a calling application to fail when it attempts to render certain malformed HTML tags. This appears to be due to an attempt to perform a string comparison where one of the strings is a null pointer. It has been reported that this vulnerability could not be exploited to cause code execution.
