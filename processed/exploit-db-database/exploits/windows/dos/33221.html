Novell GroupWise Client is prone to an unspecified buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Successful exploits allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application using the ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer). Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

Novell GroupWise Client 7.0.3.1294 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
