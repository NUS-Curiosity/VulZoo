Outlook Express and Windows Mail are prone to a cross-domain information-disclosure vulnerability.

This vulnerability may let a malicious website access properties of a site in an arbitrary external domain in the context of the victim user's browser. Attackers could exploit this issue to gain access to sensitive information (such as cookies or passwords) that is associated with the external domain.

This issue was previously reported as an Internet Explorer vulnerability, but the affected component is found to be part of Outlook Express and Windows Mail. Microsoft confirmed that this is an Outlook Express/Windows Mail vulnerability that can also be exploited through Internet Explorer.
