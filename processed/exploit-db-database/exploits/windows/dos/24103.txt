MailEnable is a commercially available POP3 and SMTP server for the Windows platform.

The 'Professional' and 'Enterprise' editions of MailEnable are reported to be prone to a remote heap buffer overflow. The overflow allows the attacker to control the EAX and ECX registers, allowing arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM.

All versions up to and including 1.18 are reported to be affected.

If logging is enabled, the request could contain:

GET /{8501 x A} HTTP/1.1
