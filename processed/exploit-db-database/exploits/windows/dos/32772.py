Nokia Multimedia Player is prone to a heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Successfully exploiting this issue may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed exploit attempts will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Nokia Multimedia Player 1.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
