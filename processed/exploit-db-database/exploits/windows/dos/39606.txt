Lzx_Decoder::init() initializes the vector Lzx_Decoder->window to a fixed size of 2^method bytes, which is then used during Lzx_Decoder::Extract(). It's possible for LZX compressed streams to exceed this size. Writes to the window buffer are bounds checked, but only after the write is completed.

The code is probably something like:

window[++window_pos] = foo;
if (window_pos > window.size())
 return false;

This means the overflow still occurs, resulting in memory corruption, and can be corrupted multiple times per stream as a single scan can contain multiple LZX compressed blobs. Scanning the attached testcase with page heap enabled results in the following error:

Please note that many of the CAV modules used by Comodo do not use dynamic base, so ASLR does not work. Naturally, all files are scanned with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and with no sandboxing.
