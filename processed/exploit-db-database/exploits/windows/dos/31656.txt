ICQ is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform boundary checks before copying user-supplied data into sensitive process buffers.

A remote attacker may execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial of service.

This issue affects ICQ 6 build 6043; other versions may also be vulnerable.
