1. *Advisory Information*

Title: IcoFX Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-1107
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/icofx-buffer-overflow-vulnerability
Date published: 2013-12-10
Date of last update: 2013-12-10
Vendors contacted: IcoFX Software
Release mode: User release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-4988


3. *Vulnerability Description*

IcoFX [1] is prone to a (client side) security vulnerability when
processing .ICO files. This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine, by enticing
the user of IcoFX to open a specially crafted icon file.


4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . IcoFX v2.5.0.0 for Windows.
   . Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.


5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

There was no official answer from vendor after several attempts to
report this vulnerability (see [Sec. 8]). As mitigation action, given
that this is a client-side vulnerability, avoid to open untrusted ICO
files. Contact vendor for further information.


6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Marcos Accossatto
from Core Exploit Writers Team. The publication of this advisory was
coordinated by Fernando Miranda from Core Advisories Team.


7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Below is shown the result of opening the maliciously crafted file
'CORE-2013-1107-icofx-poc.ico'[2] on Windows XP SP3 (EN).

The vulnerable function is located in 0x80D9F8. By loading the PoC, the
loop [0x80DA74, 0x80DA93] fills the buffer and overwrite the Exception
Handler:

/-----
0080DA74    8B45 E8           MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-18]
0080DA77    03C0              ADD EAX,EAX
0080DA79    8D94C5 8CF9FFFF   LEA EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+EAX*8-674]
0080DA80    B9 10000000       MOV ECX,10                               ;

0080DA88    8B18              MOV EBX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]
0080DA8A    FF53 0C           CALL DWORD PTR DS:[EBX+C]
0080DA8D    FF45 E8           INC DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-18]                ;
Index, will be overwritten with our value in the penultimate loop turn
0080DA90    FF4D DC           DEC DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-24]                ;
Counter, will be overwritten with our value in the penultimate loop turn
0080DA93    75 DF             JNZ SHORT 0080DA74
0080DA95    0FBF45 F0         MOVSX EAX,WORD PTR SS:[EBP-10]

At the 'MOVSX' of 0x80DA95, the CPU registers are as follows:

And the stack Exception Handler is overwritten (shellcode starts in
0x12F3A4):

As a result, the normal execution flow can be altered in order to
execute arbitrary code.
