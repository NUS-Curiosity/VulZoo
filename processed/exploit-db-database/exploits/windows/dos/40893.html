Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can trigger a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. I did not investigate this vulnerability thoroughly, so I cannot speculate on the potential impact or exploitability.

Known affected software and attack vectors

Microsoft Internet Explorer 9

An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Java­Script does not appear to be required for an attacker to triggering the vulnerable code path.

Details

This bug was found back when I had very little knowledge and tools to do analysis on use-after-free bugs, so I have no details to share. The ZDI did do a more thorough analysis and provide some details in their advisory. I have included a number of reports created using a predecessor of Bug­Id below.
