Kool Media Converter is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Kool Media Converter 2.6.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
