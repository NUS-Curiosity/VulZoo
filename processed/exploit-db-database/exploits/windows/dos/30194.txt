Apple Safari for Windows is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to properly handle user-supplied input.

An attacker may exploit this issue by enticing victims into opening a maliciously crafted HTML document.

Successful exploits can allow attackers to crash the affected browser, resulting in denial-of-service conditions.

Safari 3.0 and 3.0.1 public beta for Windows are reported vulnerable.

NOTE: At the time of writing, Symantec was unable to reproduce this vulnerability. We are investigating this issue further and will update this BID as more information emerges.
