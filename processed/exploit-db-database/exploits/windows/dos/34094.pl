Aqua Real Screensaver is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Successfully exploiting this issue may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Aqua Real 1 and 2 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
