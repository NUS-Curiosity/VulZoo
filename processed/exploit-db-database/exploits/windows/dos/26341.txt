The Microsoft Windows MSDTC (Microsoft Distribution Transaction Coordinator) service is prone to a denial of service vulnerability.

The vulnerability exists in the TIP (Transaction Internet Protocol) functionality that is provided by MSDTC. This vulnerability may be exploited by a remote attacker to deny the availability of services that depend on MSDTC.

This issue only exists on operating systems that have support for the TIP protocol enabled. This vulnerability is remotely exploitable on default configurations on Windows 2000. TIP is not enabled by default on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 even if the MSDTC service is running.

Update: Microsoft reports several systems have experienced one or more problems after installing the critical update from Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-051 for this issue. For a more detailed explanation of these problems please see the attached microsoft knowledge base article 909444.
