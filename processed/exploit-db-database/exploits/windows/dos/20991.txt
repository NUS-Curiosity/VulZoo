Microsoft IIS is prone to denial of service attacks by remote attackers. This can occur if the remote attack crafts a URL which tries to pass a script parameter that is a device name.

The end result of exploiting this vulnerability is that the server will crash and a denial of services will occur. The affected services must be restarted to regain normal functionality.
