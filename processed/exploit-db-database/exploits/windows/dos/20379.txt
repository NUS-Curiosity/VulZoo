A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in Apple's WebObjects 4.5 Developer, a popular platform for developing web-based applications. The vulnerable version is Windows NT 4.0 SP5, when run in conjunction with the CGI-adapter and IIS 4.0.

An HTTP request sent with a long header (ie, over 4.1K), will crash webobjects.exe. This may also permit the attacker to remotely execute code with the privilege of IIS, but this has not been verified.

This vulnerability is reportedly present only in installations running under a development license. Those licensed for deployment are not affected.
