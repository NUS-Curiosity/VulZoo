Explorer.exe that ships with Microsoft Windows XP prior to Windows XP SP2 is reported prone to a denial of service vulnerability.

The vulnerability is reported to exist when Explorer.exe handles certain TIFF format images.

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability by presenting a malicious image to a victim user. When this image is processed in a sufficient manner, system resources will be consumed. This will impact the performance of the computer, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

The following example TIFF image is available:

49 49 2a 00 08 00 00 00 01 00 00 01 03 00 01 00
00 00 01 00 00 00 08 00 00 00

This should be placed in a file and given a '.tif' extension.
