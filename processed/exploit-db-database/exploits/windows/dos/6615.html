Opera Window Object Suppressing Remote Denial of Service.

*Version Affected:*
Opera 9.52

*Severity:*
High

*Description:*
The opera browser is vulnerable to window object based denial of
service attack. The opera fails to sanitize a check when window.close()
function is called in number of dynamically generated events.. The
function is called in a suppressed manner and kills the parent window
directly by default which makes it vulnerable to denial of service attack.

This security issue is a result of design flaw in the browser.Scripts
must not
close windows that were not opened by script,if script specific code is
designed.
There must be a parent window confirmation check prior to close of window.
