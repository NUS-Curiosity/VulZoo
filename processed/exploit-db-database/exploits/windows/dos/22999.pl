Meteor FTP Server is prone to a memory corruption vulnerability that can be triggered by a malicious client via an overly value for the FTP USER command. This could be exploited to cause a server crash.

Further reports indicate that this may likely also be exploited to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected server.
