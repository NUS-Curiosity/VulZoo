Deny of service occurs during parsing of included compressed streams (gotta use bdc.exe /arc option) in cause of using /FlateDecode /ASCIIHexDecode compression options and object tag /JavaScript in pdf. From time to time occurs either DoS with rewriting of arithmetic registers with the contents of user's decrypted buffer or an infinite loop during scanning after modifying stream-buffer we have such results:

Access violation when reading [30333037] - use Shift+F7/F8/F9 to pass exception to program
