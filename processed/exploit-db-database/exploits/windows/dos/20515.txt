Microsoft Internet Explorer ships with a task scheduler engine (mstask.exe). By default mstask.exe listens between port 1025 to 1220.

It is possible for a user to cause CPU utilization DoS. Sending malformed arguments to the mstask.exe service will cause the CPU utilization to spike. By default, mstask.exe enables connections through the local host only. A restart of the system is required in order to gain normal functionality.

Exploitation of this vulnerability could be more serious with repeated attacks.
