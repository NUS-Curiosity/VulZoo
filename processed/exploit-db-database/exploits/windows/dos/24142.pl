A denial of service condition is reported to exist in the MollenSoft Lightweight FTP Server that may allow a remote user to deny service to legitimate FTP users. The vulnerability is due to a lack of sufficient boundary checks performed on CWD command arguments.

It should be noted that although this vulnerability is reported to affect Mollensoft Lightweight FTP Server version 3.6 other versions might also be affected.
