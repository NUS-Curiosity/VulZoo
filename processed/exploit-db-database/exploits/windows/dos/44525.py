Vendor:

Product:
========
Internet Explorer (Windows 10)
v11.371.16299.0

Internet Explorer is a series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft and included in the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995.


Vulnerability Type:
==================
Denial Of Service


CVE Reference:
==============
N/A


Security Issue:
================
A null pointer de-reference (read) results in an InternetExplorer Denial of Service (crash) when MSIE encounters an specially crafted
HTML HREF tag containing an empty reference for certain Windows file types. Upon IE crash it will at times daringly attempt to restart itself,
if that occurs and user is prompted by IE to restore their browser session, then selecting this option so far in my tests has shown to repeat the
crash all over again. This can be leveraged by visiting a hostile webpage or link to crash an end users MSIE browser.

Referencing some of the following extensions .exe:, .com:, .pif:, .bat: and .scr: should produce the same :)

Tested Windows 10
