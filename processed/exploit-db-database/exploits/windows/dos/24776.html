Mozilla Firefox is prone to a vulnerability that may result in a browser crash. This issue is exposed when the browser performs an infinite JavaScript array sort operation. It is conjectured that this will only result in a denial of service and is not further exploitable to execute arbitrary code, though this has not been confirmed.

It is not known if other Mozilla products or Gecko-based browsers are affected by this vulnerability.
