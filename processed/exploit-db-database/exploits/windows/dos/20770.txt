The GoAhead Web Server is a freely available, open source software package developed by GoAhead. The GoAhead Web Server offers a multi-platform web server and source code to the community.

A problem with the web server makes it possible to deny service to legitmate users of the software package. By accessing the web server, and issuing a request for the /aux directory, the web server ceases functioning. The process has to be manually restarted to resume normal operation.

Therefore, it is possible for a remote user to deny service to legitimate users of the web server.

telnet web.server 80
GET /aux
then hit return twice
