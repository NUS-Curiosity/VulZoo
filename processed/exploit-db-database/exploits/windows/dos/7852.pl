# Title: FTPShell Server 4.3 (licence key) Remote Buffer Overflow PoC
#
# Summary: FTPShell server is a windows FTP service that enables remote file downloads and uploads.
# It supports regular and secure FTP based on both SSL/TLS and SSH2. It is also extremely easy to
# configure and use.
#
# Product web page: http://www.ftpshell.com/index.htm
#
# Desc: FTPShell Server 4.3 suffers from buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited remotely or localy.
# It fails to perform adequate boundry condition of the input .key file, allowing us to overwrite the EAX and EDX
# registers. When trying to install licence with less than 8000 bytes we get a message: "It appears that your key
# file is corrupt or invalid.", but when installing a licence with 8000 bytes we get a message: "Your licence key
# has been succesfully loaded. Please restart the program."
#
# Note: When you restart the program, it will always crash untill you repair it or reinstall it.
