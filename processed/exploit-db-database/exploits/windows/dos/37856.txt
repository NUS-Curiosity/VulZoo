Notes:

- Reliably reproduces with latest Adobe Flash Player Projector for Windows and Google Chrome for Windows.

- The out-of-bounds read appears to be caused by an overly large index value (stored in the "EDX" register at the time of the crash) relative to a dynamically allocated buffer pointed to by "EAX".

- The memory under "EAX" contains a section of the input file starting at offset 0x3453b7.

- The index (EDX) value originates from offset 0x3453b8 in the file (at 1 byte offset relative to the EAX memory region).

- Attached samples: signal_sigsegv_7ffff6d2184d_5692_9217909125eb9174614e1368d5f07173 (crashing file), 9217909125eb9174614e1368d5f07173 (original file). The total difference between the two files is 13 bytes.
