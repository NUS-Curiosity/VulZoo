SAS Integration Technologies Client 9.31_M1 (SASspk.dll) Stack-based Overflow


Vendor: SAS Institute Inc.
Product web page: http://www.sas.com
Affected version: Deployment Manager 9.3.0.0 (Model 12.05, TS1M2)
                  SAS Integration Technologies Client 9.31_M1

Summary: SAS Integration Technologies provides you with software that
enables you to build a secure client/server infrastructure on which to
implement SAS distributed processing solutions. With SAS Integration
Technologies, you can integrate SAS with other applications in your
enterprise; provide proactive delivery of information from SAS throughout
the enterprise; extend the capabilities of SAS to meet your organization's
specific needs; and develop your own distributed applications that leverage
the analytic and reporting powers of SAS. The SAS Deployment Manager is
used for post-installation configuration tasks such as configuring some
products, applying hot fixes, updating metadata, and uninstalling SAS
software.

Desc: The SASspk module (SASspk.dll) version 9.310.0.11307, has a
function called 'RetrieveBinaryFile()' which has one parameter called
'bstrFileName' which takes arguments as strings as defined in the
function itself as ISPKBinaryFile from the SASPackageRetrieve library.
Stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in one of the fuzzing
processes that could allow arbitrary code execution by an attacker
when exploiting the non-sanitized 'bstrFileName' parameter.
