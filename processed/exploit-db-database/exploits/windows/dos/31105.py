Titan FTP Server is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

An attacker may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges. Successfully exploiting this issue will result in the complete compromise of affected computers. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial of service.

This issue affects Titan FTP Server 6.05 build 550; other versions may also be vulnerable.

# First of all, thanks to my wife Edita.
#
# Heap overflow in Titan FTP Server version 6.05 build 550
# (DELE ) - probably other commands are vulnerable too
# PoC tested on WinXP sp1
# EAX and ESI are overwritten with 41414141 and 44444444
#
# Greetz to muts, m1k1, bolexxx
# and crew from offsec, remote-exploit.org, Cedes.ba, Itas and Cikom :)
