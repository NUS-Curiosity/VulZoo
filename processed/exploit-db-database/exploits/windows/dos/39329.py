InfraRecorder is prone a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed exploit attempts likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

InfraRecorder 0.53 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
