Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. I did not investigate this vulnerability thoroughly, so I cannot speculate on the potential impact or exploitability.

Known affected software and attack vectors

Microsoft Internet Explorer 9

An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Java­Script does not prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.

Description

This is the first security vulnerability I sold to ZDI after I quit my job at Google to live off security bug bounties. It appears I either did not analyze this issue (probably), or misplaced my analysis (probably not), as I cannot find any details in my archives, other than a repro and a HTML bug report (provided below) created by a predecessor to Bug­Id. From the information provided by ZDI in their advisory, and Microsoft in their bulletin, as well as the bug report, it seems to have been a use-after-free vulnerability. Unfortunately, that is all the analysis I can provide.
