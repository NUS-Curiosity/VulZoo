Microsoft Internet Explorer is affected by a denial of service vulnerability.

This issue presents itself when the browser handles a specially crafted IMG element in a malformed XML block.

An attacker may exploit this issue by enticing a user to visit a malicious site resulting in a denial of service condition in the application.

A proof of concept is available:
<table><tr><td><IMG align=left>X X X<?xml:namespace prefix=v ><v:X style="HEIGHT:1"></td></tr></table>
