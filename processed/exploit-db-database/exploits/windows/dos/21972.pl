SmartMail Server is reported to be prone to a denial of service when a client is sending data and then closes the connection unexpectedly.

SmartMail Server will need to be restarted to regain normal functionality.

This issue was reported in SmartMail Server 2.0 Interim Build 83. It is not known if other versions are affected.
