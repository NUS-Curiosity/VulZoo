Ingress Database Server included in CA eTrust Secure Content Manager is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities, including multiple stack- and heap-based buffer-overflow issues, multiple pointer-overwrite issues, and an arbitrary-file-overwrite issue.

Successful exploits will allow attackers to completely compromise affected computers, including executing arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges and truncating the 'alarkp.def' file.
