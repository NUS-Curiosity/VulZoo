Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can cause Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 to continue to use an object after freeing the memory used to store the object. An attacker might be able to exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code.

Known affected software and attack vectors

Microsoft Internet Explorer 10

An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.

Description

The last line of script (design­Mode = "off") will cause some cleanup in MSIE, which appears to trigger use of a stale pointer in CEdit­Adorner::Detach. I did not investigate further.
