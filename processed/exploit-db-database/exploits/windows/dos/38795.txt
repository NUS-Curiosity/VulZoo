The attached testcase crashes Window 7 32-bit with Special Pool enabled on win32k.sys due to a use-after-free condition. The bug appears to be a race condition between two threads and multiple runs on the PoC might be required to trigger the bug. This is more reliable on systems with multiple cores.
