Google Chrome Window Object Suppressing Remote Denial of Service.

*Version Affected:*
Chrome/0.2.149.30
Chrome/0.2.149.29
Chrome/0.2.149.27

*Severity:*
High

*Description:*
The Google chrome browser is vulnerable to window object based denial of
service
attack. The Google Chrome fails to sanitize a check when window.close()
function is
called in body upload. The function is called in a suppressed manner and
kills the
parent window directly by default which makes it vulnerable to denial of
service attack.
This inability of Google Chrome diversifies the attack pattern as number
of events can
execute this  function without a security check,prompting a user to
allow the event to trigger.

This security issue is a result of design flaw in the browser as
function show
stringent behavior in many cases. .Scripts must not close windows that were
 not opened by script,if script specific code is designed. There must
be a parent
window confirmation check prior to close of window.

/NOTE: If this page is opened in Google Chrome , You need to open this
POC in
new window to see the killing of parent window. You can even use a Sub
Tab in this.
