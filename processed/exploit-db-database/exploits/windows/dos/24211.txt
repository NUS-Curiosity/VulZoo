A vulnerability is reported to exist in Internet Explorer that may allow an attacker to cause the application to crash. The issue presents itself when a user attempts to invoke the "Save As" option on a malicious HREF URI.

When this URI is processed the issue leads to a crash in the running instance of Internet Explorer and all windows spawned from this instance.
