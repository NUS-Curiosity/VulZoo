Synopsis
A specially crafted web-page can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. I did not investigate this vulnerability thoroughly, so I cannot speculate on the potential impact or exploitability.

Known affected software and attack vectors
Microsoft Internet Explorer 9
An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Java­Script should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.
Details
This bug was found back when I had very little knowledge and tools to do analysis on use-after-free bugs, so I have no details to share. EIP revealed that this was a use-after-free vulnerability. I have included a number of reports created using a predecessor of Bug­Id below.
