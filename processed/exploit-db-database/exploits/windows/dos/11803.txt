A vulnerability exists in the way Crimson Editor reads file types from within configuration files and can be exploited, by malicious people, to compromise a vulnerable system.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, by tricking a user into using a maliciously constructed configuration file (cedt.cfg).

This vulnerability is confirmed in Crimson Editor version 3.70.
