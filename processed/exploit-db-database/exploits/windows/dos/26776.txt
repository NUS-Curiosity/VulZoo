Sights 'n Sounds Streaming Media Server is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation will likely result in a crash of the 'SWS.exe' application, denying service to legitimate users. Arbitrary code execution may also be possible, this may facilitate privilege escalation to SYSTEM level.

Sights 'n Sounds Streaming Media Server version 2.0.3.b is affected.
