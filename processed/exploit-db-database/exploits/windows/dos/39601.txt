Packman is an obscure opensource executable packer that Comodo Antivirus attempts to unpack during scanning. The code is available online here:

http://packmanpacker.sourceforge.net/

If the compression method is set to algorithm 1, compression parameters are read directly from the input executable without validation. Fuzzing this unpacker revealed a variety of crashes due to this, such as causing pointer arithmetic in CAEPACKManUnpack::DoUnpack_With_NormalPack to move pksDeCodeBuffer.ptr to an arbitrary address, which allows an attacker to free() an arbitrary pointer.

This issue is obviously exploitable to execute code as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

The attached testcase will attempt to free() an invalid pointer to demonstrate this.
