My Web Server is a web server software package distributed and maintained by MyWebServer LLC. It is designed for the Microsoft Windows operating system.

It has been reported that My Web Server does not properly handle long requests. Because of this, a remote user placing a HTTP GET request of excessive length could cause the server to become unstable. In most cases, a long GET request causes the web server to crash, requiring a manual restart of the service.
