IBM DB2 Universal Database is a distributed database application.

It may be possible for a database user to crash the server through a bug in handling certain queries. If a certain query is executed that contains a datetime type and varchar type, the server may cease to fucntion requiring a manual reset. The following example was submitted by Benjurry in their advisory:

connect reset;
connect to sample user db2admin using db2admin;
select * from employee where year(birthdate)=1999 and firstnme<'';

It is not known what the cause for this behaviour is. Restarting the application is required in order to regain normal functionality.
