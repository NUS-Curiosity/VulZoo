It has been reported that CesarFTP is prone to a remote resource exhaustion vulnerability. This issue is due to the application failing to properly validate user input.

Successful exploitation of this issue may cause the affected server to hang, denying service to legitimate users. It has been conjectured that this issue may be due to a boundary management problem that may lead to arbitrary code execution, however this has yet to be verified.
