Serveez is prone to a remote stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Serveez 0.1.7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
