Red Faction is a commercial 3D first person shooter game developed by Volition and published by THQ.

Red Faction allows up to 32 players to game across a LAN or TCP/IP. Both the Red Faction Game Server and the client communicate on port 7755 by default. If UDP packets are sent to the port Red Faction is listening on, this will cause both the Game Server and the client to crash.

The following example is sufficient to crash Red Faction:

nmap -sU -p 7755 <ip>
