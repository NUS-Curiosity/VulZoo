Microsoft Windows is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the software fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users. Arbitrary code execution may be possible, but this has not been confirmed.

This issue affects Microsoft Windows XP SP2.

Note: Further analysis reveals that this is not a vulnerability; this BID is now retired.

Copy paste the following lin cmd.exe:

%COMSPEC% /K "dir

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
