Sonique is prone to a remote stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Sonique 2.0 Beta Build 103 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
