Microsoft Windows is prone to a local privilege-escalation vulnerability.

A local attacker may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with kernel-level privileges. Successful exploits will result in the complete compromise of affected computers. Failed exploit attempts may cause a denial-of-service condition.

Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows 2003 are affected by this issue.
