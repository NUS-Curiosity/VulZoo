Divide Error in Windows Kernel


1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Divide Error in Windows Kernel
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-0807
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/divide-error-in-windows-kernel
Date published: 2013-12-11
Date of last update: 2013-12-11
Vendors contacted: Microsoft
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Integer overflow [CWE-190]
Impact: Denial of service
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2013-5058


3. *Vulnerability Description*

Windows kernel is prone to a security vulnerability when executing the
(GDI support) function 'RFONTOBJ::bTextExtent' located in 'win32k.sys'.
This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to crash the
windows kernel by calling the user mode function 'NtGdiGetTextExtent'
with specially crafted arguments.

Microsoft notifies that this vulnerability may allow Elevation of
Privilege attacks but did not provide further technical details.


4. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

For additional information regarding affected versions, non-affected
versions, fixes and official patches please visit:

   . Description of the security update for Windows kernel-mode drivers
- http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2893984


5. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Nicolas Economou
from Core Exploit Writers Team. The publication of this advisory was
coordinated by Fernando Miranda from Core Advisories Team.


6. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The vulnerable function is 'RFONTOBJ::bTextExtent', located in the
Windows kernel driver 'win32k.sys'. The way to call this function from
user mode is calling the function 'NtGdiGetTextExtent'.

The bug takes place when performing a signed division 'IDIV', the result
does not fit in the destination and the kernel raises an 'INTEGER
OVERFLOW' exception.


6.1. *Proof of Concept*

The following PoC was compiled in VS2012 and tested against Windows XP
and Windows 7, and it allows reproducing the vulnerability. By running
this PoC the affected OS will crash into a blue screen.
