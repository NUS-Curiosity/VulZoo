Working Resources BadBlue is reportedly prone to a denial of service condition when handling malformed GET requests.

It has been discovered that BadBlue does not properly handle requests that do not adhere to RFC standards. When a user connects to BadBlue via the listening port, and issues a "GET HTTP/1.0" request without specifying a document, BadBlue becomes unstable. In most cases, the process will crash.
