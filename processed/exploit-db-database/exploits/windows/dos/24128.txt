ActiveState Perl and Perl for cygwin are both reported to be prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The issue is reported to exist due to a lack of sufficient bounds checking that is performed on data that is passed to a Perl system() function call. This vulnerability may permit an attacker to influence execution flow of a vulnerable Perl script to ultimately execute arbitrary code. Arbitrary code execution will occur in the context of the user who is running the malicious Perl script.
