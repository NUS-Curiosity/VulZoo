# Title: Cyclope Internet Filtering Proxy 4.0 - CEPMServer.exe DoS (Poc).
# From: The eh?-Team || The Great White Fuzz (we're not sure yet)
# Found by: loneferret
# Software link: http://www.cyclope-series.com/download/index.aspx?p=2

# Date Found: Oct 20th 2011
# Tested on: Windows XP SP3 Professional / Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard
# Tested with: Registered and Unregistered versions
# Nod to the Exploit-DB Team

# The Cyclope Internet Filtering Proxy is your basic white & black list website navigation filtering app.
# It will log all of the client's activities such as visited web sites, the time etc.
# There's an optional client application if the administrator wishes to acquire the computer name and user
# information.

# The CEPMServer service is what logs user and computer name when one uses the optional client application.
# This service is always on regardless of the client's use. So sending an abonormaly large string will cause a
# crash. It doesn't stop the filtering but it does stop it from logging usernames and computer names.
# Seeing this application is pretty unstable, most often then not you need to re-install Cyclope completely
# to have the logging feature to work again.

# No registers are overwriten with this PoC, but it is possible to get ESI & EAX. Just throw SPIKE at it
# and you'll get those 2 registers. I was just too lazy this morning to investigate so...

# As always, if someone can make something more out of this PoC go right ahead.
# Have fun,
