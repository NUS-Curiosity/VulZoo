The spreadsheet component of Microsoft Works is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities, including buffer-overflow and denial-of service issues.

These issues occur because the application fails to handle specifically crafted spreadsheet documents when importing them into Microsoft Works.

These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of affected application. Attackers may also crash vulnerable applications, denying service to legitimate users.

Microsoft Works version 8.0 is vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.
