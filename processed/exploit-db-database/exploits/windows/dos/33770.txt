Microsoft Windows Media Player is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability when handling specially crafted AVI files.

An attacker can exploit this issue by enticing an unsuspecting user to open a malicious file with the vulnerable application. A successful exploit may allow arbitrary code to run in the context of the currently logged-in user.

Windows Media Player 11 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

UPDATE (Mar 19, 2010): The vendor has not been able to replicate this issue. Pending further investigation, this BID will be updated and possibly retired.
