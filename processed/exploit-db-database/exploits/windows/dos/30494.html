Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

This issue occurs when rendering VML (Vector Markup Language) graphics.

Attackers can leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the currently logged-in user.

Successful attacks may facilitate the remote compromise of affected computers. Failed attacks will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

To exploit this issue, an attacker must entice an unsuspecting user to view a malicious HTML document.

A VML document containing the following construct pointing to a malicious compressed image file will trigger this issue:
