Adobe Acrobat/Acrobat Reader is reported prone to a remote format string vulnerability. The vulnerability is present in the ETD file parser when processing tag values. Reports indicate that the values supplied for certain tags are used as the format string in an unspecified formatted output function. Because an attacker can control the format string and the variables passed to the formatted output function, this vulnerability may be exploited to write to arbitrary locations within the memory of the process.
