Description:
This is nothing special - there is just flaw in Rosoft Media Player 4.1.8, similar to one discovered by Juan Pablo Lopez Yacubian.
This one concerns RML file. This is Stack Based Buffer Overflow vulerability - we can ovewrite EIP. I hope that it was not reported before.

"#EXTINF:Played=0\n" + "A" * 5000 + "\n"
