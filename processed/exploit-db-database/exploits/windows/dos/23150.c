It has been reported that ChatZilla is prone to a denial of service vulnerability. The problem arises as a remote attacker posing as an IRC server sends specially crafted requests to the client containg large strings.

If successful, an attack would lead to a denial of service in the client software.

It is not known if this condition could also be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the client.

ChatZilla versions 0.8.23 and prior are reported to be prone to this issue.
