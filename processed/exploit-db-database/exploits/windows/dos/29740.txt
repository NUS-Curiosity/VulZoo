The 'minigzip' tool is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

A local attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial of service.
