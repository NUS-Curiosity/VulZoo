Orenosv HTTP/FTP server is prone to a remote buffer overflow vulnerability that affects 'cgissi.exe'.

This issue presents itself when the application handles excessive values supplied through an SSI command name.

A successful attack can result in memory corruption and can be leveraged to cause a denial of service condition or arbitrary code execution. Arbitrary code execution can result in a remote compromise in the context of the server.

Orenosv HTTP/FTP Server 0.8.1 is reportedly vulnerable, however, other versions may be affected as well.
