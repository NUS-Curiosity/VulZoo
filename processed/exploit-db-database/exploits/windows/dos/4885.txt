Quicktime is a well known media player developed by Apple.

2) Bug
======


The problem is a buffer-overflow which happens during the filling of
the LCD-like screen containing info about the status of the connection.

For exploiting this vulnerability is only needed that an user follows
a rtsp:// link, if the port 554 of the server is closed Quicktime will
automatically change the transport and will try the HTTP protocol on
port 80, the 404 error message of the server (other error numbers are
valid too) will be visualized in the LCD-like screen.

During my tests I have been able to fully overwrite the return address
anyway note that the visible effects of the vulnerability could change
during the usage of the debugger (in attaching mode it's everything
ok).
