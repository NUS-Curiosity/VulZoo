A remote buffer overflow vulnerability affects the IN_CDDA.dll library of Nullsoft's Winamp. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly validate the length of user-supplied strings prior to copying them into finite process buffers. It should be noted that this issue is not related to the issue outlined in BID 11730 (Nullsoft Winamp IN_CDDA.dll Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability).

This issue will facilitate remote exploitation as an attacker may distribute malicious play-list files and entice unsuspecting users to process them with the affected application.
