A problem with Microsoft Internet Explorer may make it possible to deny service to users of the browser. The problem is in the handling of certain types of stylesheet input.

It may be possible to crash IE. When IE encounters a style sheet with the p{cssText} element declared, and a font weight of bold is specified, the browser crashes. This could be used as a denial of service attack.


<style>p{cssText: font-weight: bold;}</style>
