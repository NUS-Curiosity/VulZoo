OpenEdge is prone to multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits can allow attackers to cause the application to become unresponsive, denying service to legitimate users.

This issue affects OpenEdge 10b; other versions may also be vulnerable.
