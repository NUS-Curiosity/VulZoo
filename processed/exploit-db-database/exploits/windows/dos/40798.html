Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can cause the Javascript engine of Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 to free memory used for a string. The code will keep a reference to the string and can be forced to reuse it when compiling a regular expression.

Known affected software, attack vectors and mitigations

Microsoft Internet Explorer 8

An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.

Description

Recompiling the regular expression pattern during a replace can cause the code to reuse a freed string, but only if the string is freed from the cache by allocating and freeing a number of strings of certain size, as explained by Alexander Sotirov in his Heap Feng-Shui presentation.
