AOL Instant Messenger is reported prone to a remote denial of service vulnerability.

The issue manifests when the affected client application handles a chat invitation, a file transfer, or a game request that contains 'smiley' HTML code that passes invalid data as the location of the 'smiley' icon.

Reports indicate that the issue manifests because of a buffer overflow condition this, however, is not confirmed.

A remote attacker may leverage this condition to crash a target AOL Instant Messenger client. Other attacks may also be possible.
