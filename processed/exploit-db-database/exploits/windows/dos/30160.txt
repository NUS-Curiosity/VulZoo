Microsoft Windows is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to properly handle maliciously crafted ICO files.

An attacker may exploit this issue by enticing victims into opening a malicious file.

Successful exploits will result in denial-of-service conditions on applications using the affected library. Applications such as Windows Explorer or Picture and Fax viewer have been identified as vulnerable.
