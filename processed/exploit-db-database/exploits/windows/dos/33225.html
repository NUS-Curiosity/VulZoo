EasyMail Objects ActiveX control is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application (typically Internet Explorer) using the ActiveX control. Failed exploit attempts likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

EasyMail Objects 6.0.2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
Spam Inspector 4.0.354 is vulnerable.
