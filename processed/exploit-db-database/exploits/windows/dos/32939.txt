The Trend Micro OfficeScan Client is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to handle nested directories with excessively long names.

Successfully exploits will crash the affected application, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. Given the nature of this issue, code execution may be possible, but has not been confirmed.

OfficeScan 8.0 SP1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
