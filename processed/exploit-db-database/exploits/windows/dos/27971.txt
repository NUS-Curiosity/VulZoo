Microsoft Internet Explorer is affected by a memory-corruption vulnerability. This issue arises because the application fails to handle exceptional conditions in a proper manner.

An attacker may exploit this issue by enticing a user to visit a malicious site and then to click anywhere on the page. This results in a denial-of-service condition in the application.

The vendor reports this issue may also be exploited to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim user.
