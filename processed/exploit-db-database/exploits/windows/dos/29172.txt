The Microsoft Office HTMLMARQ.OCX library is prone to a denial-of-service issue.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the affected application, denying service to legitimate users. Remote code execution may also be possible, but this has not been confirmed.

This issue affects Microsoft Office 97 for Windows; other versions may also be affected.
