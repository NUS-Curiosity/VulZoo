Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because the application fails to handle certain HTML code.

This issue is triggered when a remote attacker entices a victim user to visit a malicious website.

Attackers may exploit this issue to crash Internet Explorer, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

This issue affects Internet Explorer 6.
