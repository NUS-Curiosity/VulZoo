### CherryTree 0.36.9 - Memory Corruption PoC by n30m1nd ###

# Date: 2016-10-27
# PoC Author: n30m1nd
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/
# Software Link: http://www.giuspen.com/software/cherrytree_0.36.9_setup.exe
# Version: Affects all versions of CherryTree prior to 0.37.6
# Tested on: Win7 64bit and Win10 64 bit

# Credits
# =======
# Thanks to Giusepe Penone for this invaluable piece of free, open source software and also for quickly patching this vuln.
# Shouts to the crew at Offensive Security for their huge efforts on making	the infosec community better

# How to
# ======
# * Run this python script. It will generate a "PoC-1.ctd" file.
# * Open the file and hover over the link.
# Bonus
# =====
# It will also crash if you click on the link (but it will also make your graphic drivers stop working sometimes...)

# Why?
# ====
# For what we have seen debugging the crash (thanks R0c0!), it happens inside libcairo2.0.dll due to a null pointer reference when
# trying to draw the contents of the graphical bitmaps.

# Exploit code
# ============
