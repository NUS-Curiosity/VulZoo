A denial of service vulnerability has been reported for Monkey HTTP server. The vulnerability is due to inadequate checks being performed when decoding POST requests.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by issuing a POST request with an invalid Content-Length header, or without a Content-Length value. When the server attempts to service the request, it will crash and lead to the denial of service condition.

POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:2001
Content-Length: 1
