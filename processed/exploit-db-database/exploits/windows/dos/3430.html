Well, Adobe guys do a good job after the publication of a variety of
bug in AcroPDF.dll, one for all

From Secunia:
"Input passed to a hosted PDF file is not properly sanitised by the
  browser plug-in before being returned to users. This can be exploited
  to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session in context
  of an affected site."

So now the dll is able to understand when you're trying to insert something
wrong prompting you with "One or more of the query terms are too long."
and that's a good thing but... I thought "can this dll sanitise chars like
%n"
Well the answer is: no.

Unfortunately (sure depends by the point of view) Internet Explorer is
not useful for a test 'cause a limited number of chars (only 2083) is
admitted
in the address bar, so we need to use browser like Firefox and stuff like
that.
When you browse to a hosted pdf file like this
http://somesite/poc.pdf#search=%n%n%n... x 10000 (or much more if you like)
the browse will stop to answer until the process AcroRd32.exe crashes,
the CPU usage is about 50-60% and the paging file usage grow until
it's full and you have the message "Insufficient virtual memory..."
Here's a proof of concept, for online demonstration see:
