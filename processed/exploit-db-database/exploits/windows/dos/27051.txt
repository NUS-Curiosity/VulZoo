Microsoft Windows WMF graphics-rendering engine is affected by multiple memory-corruption vulnerabilities. These issues affect the 'ExtCreateRegion' and 'ExtEscape' functions.

These problems present themselves when a user views a malicious WMF-formatted file containing specially crafted data.

Reports indicate that these issues lead to a denial-of-service condition. Earlier conjectures that the issues may result in the execution of arbitrary code appear at this point to be incorrect. Attackers could force a crash or restart of the viewing application.
