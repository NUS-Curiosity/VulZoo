Vendor:
================================
www.lantricks.com


Product:
================================
LanWhoIs.exe 1.0.1.120

LanWhoIs querys and returns domain (site) holder or IP address informations.


Vulnerability Type:
===================
Buffer Overflow


CVE Reference:
==============
N/A


Vulnerability Details:
======================

LanWhoIs contains a file parsing stack buffer overflow vulnerability. The program has a whois_result.xml
XML file located under the LanWhoIs directory. This file holds results returned from program queries. If
LanWhoIs is installed under c:\ instead of 'Program Files' etc.. on shared PC and a non adminstrator user
has access they can still edit the whois_result.xml, abusing the vuln program and possibly escalate privileges
or run arbitrary code etc.

e.g.

<WhoisResult>
  <Result>
<QueryString>216.239.37.99</QueryString>
    <ServerName>whois.arin.net</ServerName>
    <QueryDate>02.01.2005 16:17:30</QueryDate>
    <QueryType>-1</QueryType>

We can exploit the program by injecting malicious payload into the <QueryString> node of the local XML file
causing buffer overflow overwriting both pointers to the NSEH & SEH exception handlers & control EIP at about 676 bytes.

e.g.

<QueryString>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.....shellcode...etc..</QueryString>

==========

Run below script, then copy and insert payload into <QueryString> </QueryString> XML node
and run the application. Next, select the address in the Results window pane and then click Query button
to run a whois lookup or use the 'F3' keyboard cmd to execute and KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!
