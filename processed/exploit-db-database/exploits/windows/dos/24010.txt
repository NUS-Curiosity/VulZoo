It has been reported that Real Networks Helix Universal Server is affected by a remote denial of service vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly handle malformed RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol) requests.

An attacker may leverage this issue to trigger a denial of service condition in the affected server.
