AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) is a real time messaging service. The AIM client runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

It is possible to crash the AIM client by sending a specially formatted hyper-link to a user. When the user attempts to launch the malicious hyper-link, the client will crash.

This issue appears to be caused by an unchecked buffer in the AIM software. As a result, it may also be possible to exploit this issue to cause attacker-supplied instructions to be executed on the machine of a user running the vulnerable client.

1- Make sure you have AIM 4.8.2646 installed

2- Open a new IM window and click the link button to setup a hyperlink
for your buddy.

4- Input the exact text into the link
aim:addbuddy?screenname=12345678,12345678,12345678,12345678,12345678,
12345678,12345678,12345678,12345678,12345678,12345678&groupname=
12345678,12345678,12345678,12345678,12345678,12345678,12345678
,12345678,12345678,12345678,

5- The text can be anything as long as it meets the format of 8
characters for each word to add as a screenname and a groupname, the
instances should be 11 for the screenname and 10 for the groupname

6- A memory dump will occurs as soon as the hyperlink is clicked by
either side (You or your buddy).
