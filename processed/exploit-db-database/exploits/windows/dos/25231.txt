Reportedly, a denial of service vulnerability affects Microsoft Windows GDI library 'gdi32.dll'. This issue is due to a failure of the application to securely copy data from malformed EMF image files.

An attacker may leverage this issue to trigger a denial of service condition in software implementing the vulnerable library. Other attacks may also be possible.
