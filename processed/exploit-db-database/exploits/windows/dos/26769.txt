Microsoft Excel is susceptible to a remote code-execution vulnerability. This issue was originally disclosed through an eBay auction that has since been terminated.

This issue is due to the application's failure to properly bounds-check user-supplied input data in the 'Named Range' definition in Excel data files. This results in the corruption of critical memory sections, allowing code execution.

The following is a proof-of-concept example segment of an Excel data file. The '*' characters represent the location of the affected value that triggers this issue. Setting these locations to '0xFF' will crash the application.
