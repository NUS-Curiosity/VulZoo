The Opera Web browser is prone to multiple remote denial-of-service vulnerabilities and an unspecified vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit these issues to cause the affected application to crash, denying service to legitimate users.

Note: The impact of the unspecified vulnerability is not known. We will update this BID when more information emerges.

Versions prior to Opera Web Browser 11.60 are vulnerable.
