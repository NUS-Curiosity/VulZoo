A remote user on the local network is capable of retrieving any known file from a machine running AVM KEN!. This is accomplished by appending ../ to a URL utilizing port 3128 to escape the regular web file structure, and appending the remaining path onto the request.
eg.
http://target:3128/../../../filename.ext

A denial of service attack could also be launched against AVM KEN! by sending random characters to port 3128. A restart would be required in order to regain normal functionality.

/*
BARBIE - The AVM KEN! exploit

This exploit causes a crash in the AVM KEN! ISDN Proxy software.
All conections will be cut off, but the server will restart again,
a few seconds later.

Tested with AVM KEN! Version 1.03.10 (german)
