ElectroComm is a telnet-comm port server for Windows 9x/NT, allowing users to connect a PC's comm port to a TCP/IP network and login remotely using Telnet.

An attacker can execute a denial of service attack on ElectroComm by submitting two groups of approximately 160,000 characters to the target's telnet port.

This increases CPU utilization to 100%, then crashes the service, which requires a restart.
