# Contact: xsploitedsecurity [at] x-sploited.com
# Software Link: http://www.nch.com.au/oi/oisetup.exe
# Version: <= v5.20
# Tested on: Windows XP SP3
# CVE : N/A

### Software Description: ###
# Officeintercom lets you use your PC, Pocket PC and Smartphone to speak to others over the internet or a local area
# network with simple "push-to-talk" technology. It works as a virtual IP intercom and feels a little like using a CB
# radio.
# Talk to anyone else who has installed OfficeIntercom anywhere in the world from your PC or Pocket PC device. OfficeIntercom
# is designed to be fast and easy to use and, in an office environment, no cabling is be required to run OfficeIntercom
# because it uses the existing computer network.

### Exploit information: ###
# NCH Office Intercom is prone to a remote denial of service attack when parsing a maliscous SIP invite request.
# If the Content-Length field has a value of -1 (or a large integer such as 3645363) the server will crash due to a NULL pointer
# reference, causing an access violation.

### Shouts: ###
# kaotix, MaX, corelanc0d3r/corelan team, exploit-db, packetstormsecurity, all other infosec researchers and websites
#
# "When you know that you're capable of dealing with whatever comes, you have the only security the world has to offer."
