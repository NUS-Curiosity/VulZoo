A weakness has been reported in some PC Firewall packages that could allow remote denial of service attacks. The problem is in the handling of spoofed traffic.

Under some circumstances, it is possible for remote users to deny service to various sites for users of PC Firewall software. By sending spoofed traffic that could be deemed malicious by the firewall software package, an attacker could effectively limit the sites a system is capable of reaching.
