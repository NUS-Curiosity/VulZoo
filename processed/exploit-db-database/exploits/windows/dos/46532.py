# Exploit Title: Core FTP 2.0 build 653 - 'PBSZ' - Unauthenticated - Denial of Service (PoC)
# Date: 2019-03-12
# Exploit Author: Hodorsec (hodorsec@protonmail.com / hodor@hodorsec.com)
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.coreftp.com/
# Software Link: http://coreftp.com/server/download/archive/CoreFTPServer653.exe
# Version: Version 2.0, build 653, 32-bit
# Tested on: Windows 8.1 6.3 (build 9600)
# CVE: N/A

# Description:
# CoreFTP 2.0 is vulnerable to a DoS attack via the PBSZ command. Ironically, this command is being used for "Protection Buffer Size"
# and CoreFTP responds unauthenticated.
# The PBSZ command in CoreFTP only allows for a certain length of the string to be vulnerable to a DoS.
# This script triggers the DoS and filling ECX with the intented buffer.
# Although NSEH/SEH is overwritten, the executable binary is SafeSEH protected and no other assemblies are referenced.

# Replication:
# - Install CoreFTP and setup a domain with an IP and path
# - Start the service or click "Start"
# - No need to add users or set anything specific: just run the script and watch it crash

# Crash as service:
# (7e0.bf4): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
# First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
# This exception may be expected and handled.
