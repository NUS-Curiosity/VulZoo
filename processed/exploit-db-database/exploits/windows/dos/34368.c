MP3 to WAV Decoder is prone to a remote stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Successfully exploiting this issue may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.
