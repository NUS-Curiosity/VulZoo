BaoFeng Storm is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Storm 3.09.62 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
