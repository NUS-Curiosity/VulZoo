# Title: Carom3D 5.06 Unicode Buffer Overrun/Denial Of Service Vulnerability
#

#
# Description: The world famous korean game Carom3D suffers from a buffer overflow
#	       and a denial of service vulnerability. The BoF is triggered at
#	       runtime when we append 218 > bytes as an argument. ~1000 bytes
#	       overwrites SEH. The denial of service is triggered when a user
#	       creates a LAN Game (cred. needed), creates a room and awaits
#	       other players to join the game. While awaiting (listening on port
#	       28012), with a simple HTTP GET/POST, an attacker can lockdown
#	       the GUI of the user created the room, not alowing to start or
#	       even exit the game's GUI, unless forced quit (X).
#
# Tested On: Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 (English)
