It is reported that BlackICE PC Protection is prone to a local buffer overrun when handling excessive input in certain configuration directives parsed from the firewall.ini file included with the software.

It is reported that when the system is restarted, and the affected software reads the malicious firewall.ini file both the blackice.exe and blackd.exe executables will crash.
