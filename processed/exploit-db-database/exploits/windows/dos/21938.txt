A problem with SimpleWebServer could make it possible for a user to deny service to legitimate users of the server.

It has been reported that SimpleWebServer does not properly handle long requests. Because of this, a remote attacker placing a HTTP request of excessive length could cause the server to become unstable. In most cases, a long request causes the web server to crash, requiring a manual restart of the service.
