  Date :     24-04-2007

  Tested on: Windows 2000 SP4 Server English
             Windows 2000 SP4 Professional English

  Reference: https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/23530

  Vendor:    http://netsprint.pl/toolbar/install.html




  Desc: This is very interesting vulnerability. The function ischecked() takes URL as string parameter.
       But actually it is not handled by dll. When we don't give any parameter i.e. target.ischecked "" the
       IE works fine. But when we supply data as parameter the IE crashes. Interestingly you can able to
       see your data on the stack. But I am not able to overwrite any registers or SEH. So though our
       data is on the stack. Its hard to exploit. So only dos.

       May be someone can get success in this. Let me know if u find.
