A vulnerability has been reported for Opera versions 7.10 and earlier. The problem is said to occur due to insufficient bounds checking on filename extensions. As a result, it may be possible for an attacker to corrupt heap-based memory.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a denial of service, possibly prolonged. If a malicious filename entry were placed in a cache file, Opera may continuously crash until the cache file has been deleted.

print "<html><body>Love & Peace :)</body></html>\r\n";
