Introduction
Pi3Web is a free, multithreaded, highly configurable and extensible HTTP server and development environment for cross platform internet server development and deployment. Pi3web is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability whenever an invalid ISAPI module is requested from server.

Vulnerable version
Pi3Web <=2.0.3

Vulnerability
By requesting the following URL from pi3web the server crashes:
http://WEB_SITE/isapi/users.txt

EnhPi3.exe -Bad Image
The application or DLL c:\Pi3Web\Isapi\users.txt is not a valid Windows image. Please check this against your installation diskette The vulnerability is caused.

The crash is due to insufficient checks for incoming requests. Whenever a file in ISAPI directory, which is not a valid DLL is requested, the server tries to load it into memory as a DLL library and a crash happens.

Workaround
Before an official patch is released, use one of the following workarounds to mitigate the problem:

1. Disable ISAPI mapping in server configuration in Server Admin > Mapping Tab.
2. Delete the users.txt, install.daf and readme.daf in ISAPI folder.
