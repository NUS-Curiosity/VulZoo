IMail includes a service called IMail Monitor which is used for local and remote performance measuring and diagnostics. It includes a small webserver operating on port 8181 to support web-based monitoring. One of the cgi scripts, status.cgi, is used to determine which services are currently running and create a web pafge to report this information. Multiple simultaneous requests for status.cgi will cause the software to crash, with a Dr. Watson error of "Invalid Memory Address".
