StarSiege Tribes Game Server has been reported prone to a remotely triggered denial of service vulnerability.

The issue presents itself when the affected server receives and processes a malformed UDP datagram. Reportedly when the server handles a UDP datagram containing malformed data, an exception will be thrown and the StarSiege Tribes Game Server will crash. Service will be denied, to current connected users of the system.

Purpose: POC "StarSiege: Tribes" DoS

Usage: Call it from a browser once its uploaded on a server
with PHP installed:

http://host/byebye_tribes.php?host=127.0.0.1&port=28001

Note - global variables must be enabled in php.ini (yes... I
know thats bad too)

Stuff:
Yeah... too lazy to fine tune it, maybe someone else can
throw in HTML forms to give it a little interface ;-).
