The FileInfo plugin for Total Commander is prone to multiple PE file denial-of-service vulnerabilities because the plugin fails to properly handle malformed input.

Successfully exploiting these issues allows remote attackers to crash the affected application.

FileInfo 2.09 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
