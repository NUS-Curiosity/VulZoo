Product & Service Introduction:
===============================
RDP-Manager is a program for the better administration of several remote desktops and further connections. The connection parameters
as well as user name and password can be stored in the program, the latter also encrypted by an external password if desired. When opened,
the connections created are clearly structured in individual tabs in the application window, which means that the overview is retained even
if several connections are open.

Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local denial of service vulnerability has been discovered in the official RDP Manager v4.9.9.3 windows software client.
The denial of service attack allows an attacker to freeze, block or crash a local process, service or component to compromise.

The local vulnerability is located in the Verbindungsname and Server input fields of the Verbindung (Neu/Bearbeiten).
The Verbindungsname and Server inputs are not limited by the size of characters. Thus allows a local privileged attacker
to add a malformed server entry with a large size that crashs (multiple application errors) the application permanently.
The entry can be modified as zip backup for imports as sqLitedatabase.db3 to make the software unusable until a full
reinstall with separate deletes is performed to recover.

Successful exploitation of the denial of service vulnerability results in permanent unhandled software and application crashs.

Vulnerable Input(s):
[+] Verbindungsname
[+] Server

Affected Module(s):
[+] Wiederherstellen (sqLitedatabase.db3)


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The local denial of service vulnerability can be exploited by attackers with system access privileges without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.


Manual steps to reproduce ...
1. Install the RDP-Manager.exe software for windows
2. Start the software and add a new entry in the main tab
3. Include a large amount of characters max 1024 and save the entry
4. The software freezes and crashs with multiple errors in the actual session and after restart it crash permanently as well
Note: Alternativly you can export a database with regular valid entry and modify it via backup for a import
5. Successful reproduce of the local denial of service vulnerability!
