# Exploit Title: Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless for Bluetooth(R) + High Speed - Unquoted Service Path Privilege Escalation
# Date: 10/19/2016
# Exploit Author: Joey Lane
# Version: 15.1.0.0096
# Tested on: Windows 7 Professional

The Intel(R) PROSet/Wireless for Bluetooth(R) + High Speed service is installed with an unquoted service path.
This enables a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
To exploit this vulnerability, a local attacker can insert an executable file in the path of the service.
Rebooting the system or restarting the service will run the malicious executable with elevated privileges.
This was tested on version 15.1.0.0096, but other versions may be affected as well.
