A vulnerability exists within the Microsoft Clip Art Gallery, where a remote user can crash the Clip Art application or possibly execute arbitrary code.

Clip art can be downloaded from any website and incorporated into the local gallery. A particular file format called .CIL is used in order to transport new clip art files to the users. The vulnerability is that a user may open a malformed .CIL file containing a long embedded field downloaded from a malicious third-party website or in the form of an email attachment regardless of it's origin.
