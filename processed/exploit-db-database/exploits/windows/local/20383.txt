The ASP ISAPI file parser does not properly execute certain malformed ASP files that contain scripts with the LANGUAGE parameter containing a buffer of over 2200 characters and have the RUNAT value set as 'server'. Depending on the data entered into the buffer, a denial of service attack could be launched or arbitrary code could be executed under the SYSTEM privilege level in the event that a malicious ASP file were locally executed on IIS.
