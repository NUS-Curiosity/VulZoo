[Product]
HP System Event Utility


The genuine HPMSGSVC.exe file is a software component of HP System Event Utility by HP Inc.
HP System Event Utility enables the functioning of special function keys on select HP devices.


[Vulnerability Type]
Local Privilege Escalation



[CVE Reference]
CVE-2019-18915



[Security Issue]
The HP System Event service "HPMSGSVC.exe" will load an arbitrary EXE and execute it with SYSTEM integrity.
HPMSGSVC.exe runs a background process that delivers push notifications.

The problem is that HP Message Service will load and execute any arbitrary executable named "Program.exe"
if found in the users c:\ drive.

Path: C:\Program Files (x86)\HP\HP System Event\SmrtAdptr.exe

Two Handles are inherit, properties are Write/Read
Name: \Device\ConDrv

This results in arbitrary code execution persistence mechanism if an attacker can place an EXE in this location
and can be used to escalate privileges from Admin to SYSTEM.
