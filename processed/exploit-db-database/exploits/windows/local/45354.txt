# When victim attempts open file they get prompted "Do you want to let this app
# make changes to your device?" However, it also indicates it is a "verified publisher" namely Microsoft.
# After opening the local users files can be exfiltrated to a remote server.
# Moreover, we can use this to steal NTLM hashes.
