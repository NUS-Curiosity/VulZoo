1. Description:
 Macro Expert installs as a service with an unquoted service path running with SYSTEM

privileges. This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. Additionally the

default installation path suffers from weak folder permission which an unauthorized user

in the BUILTIN\Users group could take advantage of.

3. Exploit:

A successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot.
If successful, the local user's code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.
