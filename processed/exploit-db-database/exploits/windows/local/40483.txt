1) Unquoted Service Path Privilege Escalation

Leap motion's "LeapService" installs as a service with an unquoted service path running with SYSTEM privileges.
This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged localuser to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.

A successful attempt would require the local attacker must insert an executable file in the path of the service.
Upon service restart or system reboot, the malicious code will be run with elevated privileges.

C:\>sc qc LeapService
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS
