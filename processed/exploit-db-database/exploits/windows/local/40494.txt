1) Insecure File Permissions Local Privilege Escalation

Minecraft's launcher (minecraftLauncher.exe) suffers from an elevation of privileges
vulnerability which can be used by a simple user that can change the executable file
with a binary of choice. The vulnerability exist due to the improper permissions,
with the 'F' flag (Full) for 'Users' group, making the entire directory
'Minecraft' and its files and sub-dirs world-writable.

This would allow an attacker the ability to inject code or replace the MinecraftLauncher
executable and have it run in the context of the system.
