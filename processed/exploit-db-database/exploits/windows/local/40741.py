# Vulnerability Description:
# When the Avira Launcher manual update imports a zip file doesn't checks for " ../ "
# characters which makes it possible to do a path traversal and write anywhere in the system.
# Vulnerability Replication
# 1. Create a special crafted zip file with the python script attached.
# 2. The script will create a zip file named xvdf_fusebundle.zip with a filename test.bat (this can be changed) and will write this file to the root directory C:\
# 3. You can change the directory go to startup and when the user reboots the script will get executed or you can write a malicious dll to a program directory or
#    system32 directory which will get loaded and we gain remote command execution.
# 4. Open avira free antivirus
# 5. Go to update -> Manual Update
# 6. Select the malicious file
# 7. Directory traversal was sucessfull
