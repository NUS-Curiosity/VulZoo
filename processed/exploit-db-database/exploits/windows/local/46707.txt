Due to weak permissions setup on the bin, lib and tools directories within the ManageEngine installation directory, it is possible for any authenticated user to modify several core files.

To escalate privileges to that of LOCAL SYSTEM, drop a payload onto the system and then add a line to bin\ChangeJRE.bat to execute it every time the system is rebooted.
