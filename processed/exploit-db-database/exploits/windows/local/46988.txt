[Summary]
The Pronestor service "PNHM" (aka Health Monitoring or HealthMonitor)
before 8.1.12.0 has "BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F)" permissions for
the "%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\proNestor\Outlook add-in for Pronestor\PronestorHealthMonitor.exe" file,
which allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse PronestorHealthMonitor.exe file.

During the installation of Pronestors Outlook-Add-In (version 8.1.11.0
and older) the installer creates a service named PNHM (Pronester
Health Monitoring) with weak file permission running as SYSTEM.
The vulnerability allows all "Authenticated Users" to potentially
execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM on the local system.

[Additional Information]
Tested on Windows 7.
Version: Outlook Add-In 8.1.11.0 and older
Also tested on version 5.1.6.0 with same result.

C:\Program Files (x86)\proNestor\Outlook add-in for Pronestor\PronestorHealthMonitor.exe
         BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F)
         NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
         BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)

Notice: "BUILIN\Users:(I)(F)". (F) = Full access!
This means that an authenticated user can change the file

[Attack Vectors]
Replace the file "PronestorHealthMonitor.exe" with a malicious file
also called "PronesterHealthMonitor.exe". Next time the service (PNHM)
starts, the malicious file will get executed as SYSTEM. The service
starts on every reboot.

[Affected Component]
PronestorHealthMonitor.exe
This exe will be executed on every reboot by a service named PNHM running as SYSTEM.
