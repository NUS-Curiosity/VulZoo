1. Description:

Abyss Web Server installs a service called 'AbyssWebServer' with an unquoted service path running with SYSTEM privileges.
This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. Abyss Web Server also suffers from weak file and folder permissions which could allow

an unauthorized user to swop out executable files with their own payload.

2. Proof

C:\Program Files>sc qc AbyssWebServer
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS

        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL

3. Exploit:

A successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot.
If successful, the local user's code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.
