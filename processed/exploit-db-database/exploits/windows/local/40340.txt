The most widely used alarm notification software for the automation industry.
WIN-911 is used by hundreds of Fortune 500 and Global 500 companies.

- 2. Technical Details/PoC: -
This vulnerability allows attackers to escalate their privilege to system administrator
or SYSTEM on vulnerable installations of Win-911.
An attacker must have a valid user-account on the system.

PoC 1:
The product is installed under "C:\Program Files\Specter Instruments\WIN-911 V7".
This directory allows EVERYONE to modify files within this location.

Besides executables running with administrative privileges there are also various services binaries.
These all run as SYSTEM and might be overwritten to obtain SYSTEM level access:

C:\Program Files\Specter Instruments\WIN-911 V7\Mobile-911 Bridge Inbound.exe
C:\Program Files\Specter Instruments\WIN-911 V7\Mobile-911 Bridge Outbound.exe
C:\Program Files\Specter Instruments\WIN-911 V7\viewLinc Bridge.exe

PoC 2:
The web-server is installed as a separate component under:
"C:\Program Files\Specter Instruments\WEB-911 Services"
This directory allows EVERYONE full-control.
Once exploited, this could affect remote users connecting to the web-server.

- 3. Mitigation: -
None.
If you are brave, edit the permissions.
Not sure how this impacts the application.
