Certec EDV atvise SCADA server 2.5.9 Privilege Escalation Vulnerability


Vendor: Certec EDV GmbH
Product web page: http://www.atvise.com
Affected version: 2.5.9

Summary: atvise scada is based on newest technologies
and standards: The visualization in pure web technology
as well as a consistent vertical object orientation based
on OPC UA changes the world of process management systems.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path
issue impacting the service 'atserver' for Windows deployed
as part of atvise SCADA. This could potentially allow an
authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary
code with elevated privileges on the system. A successful
attempt would require the local user to be able to insert
their code in the system root path undetected by the OS or
other security applications where it could potentially be
executed during application startup or reboot. If successful,
the local user’s code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 (EN) 64-bit
           Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (EN) 64-bit
