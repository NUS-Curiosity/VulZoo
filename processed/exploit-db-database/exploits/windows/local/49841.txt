Epic Games Easy Anti-Cheat 4.0 Local Privilege Escalation


Vendor: Epic Games, Inc.
Product web page: https://www.epicgames.com
                  https://www.easy.ac
Affected version: 4.0.0.0

Summary: Easy Anti-Cheat is the industry-leading anti–cheat service,
countering hacking and cheating in multiplayer PC games through the
use of hybrid anti–cheat mechanisms.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting
the service 'EasyAntiCheat' for Windows deployed as part of Easy Anti-Cheat
Service application. This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged
local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.
A successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot.
If successful, the local user's code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 10
