# CVE : N/A

[+] Description:
Popcorn Time For Windows installs as a service with an unquoted
service path running with SYSTEM privileges.
This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.

[+] POC:
C:\Users\User>sc qc "Update service"
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: Update service
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Program Files (x86)\Popcorn Time\Updater.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Update service
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem

[+] Exploit:
A successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in "Program files (x86)" (popcorn.exe) or "C:\" (program.exe)
folders undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot.
If successful, the local user's code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.
