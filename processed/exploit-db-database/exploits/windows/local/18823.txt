===========
Description
===========

Inadequate file permissions on application binaries could result on local privilege escalation

=================
Technical Details
=================
A number of key files in the C:\Program Files\Symantec\pcAnywhere\ folder are writable by any user:

C:\Program Files\Symantec\pcAnywhere\WinAw32.exe Everyone:(OI)(CI)F
                                                NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F

C:\Program Files\Symantec\pcAnywhere\awrem32.exe Everyone:(OI)(CI)F
                                                NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F

C:\Program Files\Symantec\pcAnywhere\awhost32.exe Everyone:(OI)(CI)F
                                                 NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F

It is trivial to replace these .exe (including the main pcanywhere exe, winaw32.exe with a malicious binary). When launched by the admin, privilege escalation would be gained. The awhost32.exe is set as a service under some scenarios (SYSTEM) and allows a user to privilege escalate by overwriting this binary.
