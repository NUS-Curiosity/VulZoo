Comodo Firewall is prone to a design error in its cryptographic hashing function for component controls.

Exploiting this flaw permits attackers to bypass the application's component controls. The application keeps a list of process-module checksums for allowed components. Due to the improper use of a cyclic redundancy check, rather than a cryptographic hash function in developing module checksums, an attacker can trivially insert a malicious control with the same CRC as a trusted component.

Comodo Firewall Pro 2.4.17.183 and 2.4.16.174 and Comodo Personal Firewall 2.3.6.81 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
