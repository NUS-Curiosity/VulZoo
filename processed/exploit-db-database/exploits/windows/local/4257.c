 Author: tarkus (tarkus (at) tiifp (dot) org)
 URL: https://tiifp.org/tarkus
 Vendor: Panda (http://www.pandasoftware.com/)

Description:
------------

1.  During  installation  of  Panda Antivirus 2008 the permissions for
installation folder %ProgramFiles%\Panda Security\Panda Antivirus 2008\
by  default  are  set  to Everyone:Full Control. Few services
(e.g. PAVSRV51.EXE) are started from this folder. Services are started
under LocalSystem  account. There is no protection of service files. It's
possible for unprivileged user to replace service executable with the
file of his choice to get full access with LocalSystem privileges. Or to
get privileges or any user (including system administrator) who logons
to vulnerable host. This can be exploited by:

   a. Rename  PAVSRV51.exe to PAVSRV51.old in Panda folder
   b. Copy any application to PAVSRV51.exe
   c. Reboot

Upon reboot trojaned application will be executed with LocalSystem
account.

BTW: Check this from last year (https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/19891)
