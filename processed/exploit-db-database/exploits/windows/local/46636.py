# Tested Version: 5.99.4900                                                                               #
# Tested on: Winxp SP2 32-64 bit - Win7 Enterprise SP1 32-64 bit - Win10 Enterprise 32-64 bit             #
# Special Thanks to my wife                                                                               #
# The program has SEH Buffer Overflow in several places.(this code show one of them)                      #
# Note 1 : To optimize code, I've used a "stack pivot" that is the same in                                #
# (Extreme, Engineer, Network Audit) Editions.                                                            #
# So this code works in (Extreme, Engineer, Network Audit) of version 5.99.4900                           #
# But the stack pivots in Business Edition are different.                                                 #
# Note 2 : All the old versions of the program that are available on the sites like soft32.com,           #
# or in https://www.aida64.com/downloads/archive                                                          #
# have the same vulnerabily in different offsets (for example version 5.70.3800 )                         #
# Note 3 : this technique (EggHunter) has been used to run vulnerability in different windows versions.   #
# Steps :                                                                                                 #
#  1- Run python code : Aida64-Extreme.py ( Three files are created )                                     #
#  2- App --> File --> Preferences --> Email --> SMTP --> paste in contents from the egg.txt              #
#         into "Display name" --> Ok                                                                      #
#  3- Report --> Report Wizard ... --> Next --> paste in contents from the egghunter-winxp-win7.txt       #
#     or egghunter-win10.txt (depend on your windows version) into "Load from file" --> Next              #
#     --> Wait a minute --> Shellcode (Calc) open                                                         #
