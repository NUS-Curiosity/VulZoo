DAP 8.x (.m3u) File BOF C Exploit for XP SP2,SP3 English

SecurityFocus Advisory:
Download Accelerator Plus (DAP) is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability
because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.
Successfully exploiting this issue may allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the application.Failed exploit attempts
will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Vulnerability discoverd by Krystian Kloskowski (h07) <h07@interia.pl>
Original POC by h07 http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/6030

This poc will create a "special" .m3u file that when imported in DAP and then checked with
the verifiy button will cause a buffer overflow and  lead to exploitation.Run the program
with no args for usage info or just look in the code. :P

Tested on Windows XP English sp2&sp3.
