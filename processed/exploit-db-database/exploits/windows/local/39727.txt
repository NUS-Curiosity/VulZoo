# Version: CompuSource Systems - Real Time Home Banking
# Tested on: Windows 7
# CVE : TBD

Note: Windows Server 2003/2008/2012  *may* be vulnerable, depending on
system configuration.

This vulnerability has been reference checked against multiple installs.
This configuration was identical across all systems tested.

Executables/Services:

%SystemRoot%/css50/csdir/RealTimeHomeBankingSvc.exe
HomeBankingService

Attack Detail:
The application installs with LOCAL SYSTEM service credentials in the
directory %SystemRoot%/css50/csdir


The executables that are installed, by default, allow AUTHENTICATED USERS
to modify, replace or alter the file. This would allow an attacker to
inject their code or replace the executable and have it run in the context
of the system.


This would allow complete compromise of a machine on which it was
installed, giving the process LOCAL SYSTEM access to the machine in
question. An attacker can replace the file or append code to the
executable, reboot the system or restart the service and it would then
compromise the machine. As LOCAL SYSTEM is the highest privilege level on a
machine, this allows total control and access to all parts of the system.


Remediation:

Remove the modify/write permissions on the executables to allow only
privileged users to alter the files.
Apply vendor patch when distributed.
