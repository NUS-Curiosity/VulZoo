It has been reported that a password disclosure issue exists in CheckMail allowing a local user to access sensitive authentication information through the Windows Registry. The software stores user authentication credentials in a Windows Registry that can be viewed by a local user in order to steal e-mail passwords.

This issue could lead to further attacks as a malicious user may gather sensitive data through user e-mails.

It should be noted that the issue has been reported in CheckMail v1.2, however older versions may be vulnerable as well.
