A DLL hijacking vulnerability has been discovered in OutSystems Service
Studio 11 11.53.30 build 61739.
When a user open a .oml file (OutSystems Modeling Language), the
application will load the following DLLs from the same directory:

Using a crafted DLL, it is possible to execute arbitrary code in the
