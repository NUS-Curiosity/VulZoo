Sysax FTP Automation <= 5.33 has a privilege escalation vulnerability. This can be exploited
by leveraging the Scheduled Script -> Scheduled Task functionality. The scheduled task
function allows you to run any external program/execuable you want, without specifying
credentials. By default, this product installs under the LOCALSYSTEM service so when the
binary is executed, it runs under that context.

Sysax fixed this problem in version 5.34.
