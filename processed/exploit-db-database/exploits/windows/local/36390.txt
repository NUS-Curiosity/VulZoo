Foxit Reader 7.0.6.1126 Unquoted Service Path Elevation Of Privilege


Vendor: Foxit Software Incorporated
Product web page: http://www.foxitsoftware.com
Affected version: 7.0.6.1126 and 6.1

Summary: Foxit Reader is a small, lightning fast, and feature rich PDF
viewer which allows you to create (free PDF creation), open, view, sign,
and print any PDF file.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting
the service 'FoxitCloudUpdateService' for Windows deployed as part of Foxit
Reader. This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. A
successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot.
If successful, the local user’s code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (EN)
