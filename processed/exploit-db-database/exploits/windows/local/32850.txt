Multiple SlySoft products are prone to multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because they fail to adequately validate user-supplied input.

A local attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM-level privileges. Failed attacks will result in denial-of-service conditions.

The following applications are vulnerable:

SlySoft AnyDVD 6.5.2.2
SlySoft AnyDVD HD 6.5.2.2
SlySoft Virtual CloneDrive 5.4.2.3
SlySoft CloneDVD 2.9.2.0
SlySoft CloneCD 5.3.1.3
