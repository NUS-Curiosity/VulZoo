### Title:
Incorrect Access Control.

### Category:
Exploit

### Severity:
Critical

### Description:
Lansweeper 6.0.x through 7.2.x has a default installation in which the
admin password is configured for the admin account, unless "Built-in
admin" is manually unchecked. This allows command execution via the
Add New Package and Scheduled Deployments features.

### Other observation:
Hi, This issue is kind of critical,
By using shodan with this filter title:"Lansweeper - Login"
We will find some Lansweeper with default installation on it


### Details:
The Lansweeper application is agentless network inventory software that can be used for IT asset management.
It uses the ASP.NET technology on its web application.

### Analysis:
When you install Lansweeper 6.0 or a more recent Lansweeper release and access the web console for the first time,
you are presented with a First Run Wizard,
which allows you to set up scanning and configure some basic options.
Any subsequent times you access the console,
you are presented with a login screen.
By default, everyone in your network can access all of Lansweeper's features and menus simply by browsing to the web console URL and hitting the Built-in Admin button.

### Suggested mitigation:
restrict access to the console and configure what users can see or do once they've been granted access.
You assign a built-in or custom user role, a set of permissions, to user groups or individual user accounts.
A user's role determines what the user can see or do within the console..

### Impact/Risk:
Remote code execution
can expose the organization to unauthorized access of data and programs, fraud.
