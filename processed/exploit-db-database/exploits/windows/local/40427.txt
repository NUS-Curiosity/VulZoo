1. Description:

Iperius Remote allows the user to install the application as a service with an unquoted service path running with SYSTEM privileges. It is important to note that the application installs itself as a service in the same location where the setup file in ran from. Provided that the end user initiates the installation from a directory with spaces in it's path, this could allow an authorized but non-privileged local
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.

2. Proof

C:\>sc qc IperiusRemotesvc
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: IperiusRemotesvc
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Random Folder With Spaces\IperiusRemote.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0

        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem


3. Exploit:

A successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in the system path undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot.
If successful, the local user's code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.
