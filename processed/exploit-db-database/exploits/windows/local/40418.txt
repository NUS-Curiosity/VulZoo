1. Description:

Zortam Mp3 Media Studio installs by default to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Zortam Mp3 Media Studio\zmmspro.exe" with very weak file permissions granting any user full permission to the exe. This allows opportunity for code execution against any other user running the application.

2. Proof

C:\Program Files\Zortam Mp3 Media Studio>cacls zmmspro.exe
C:\Program Files\Zortam Mp3 Media Studio\zmmspro.exe BUILTIN\Users:F
                                                     NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(ID)F
                                                     BUILTIN\Administrators:(ID)F
                                                     BUILTIN\Users:(ID)R


3. Exploit:

Simply replace zmmspro.exe and wait for execution.
