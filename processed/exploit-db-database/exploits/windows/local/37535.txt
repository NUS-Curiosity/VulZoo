Abstract Advisory Information:
==============================
The Vulnerability Laboratory Core Research Team discovered a local seh buffer overflow vulnerability in the official Blueberry Express v5.9.0.3678 software.


Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline:
==================================
2015-06-29:          Researcher Notification & Coordination (Ateeq Khan)


Discovery Status:
=================
Published


Affected Product(s):
====================
Blueberry Software
Product: Blueberry Express - Software 5.9.0.3678


Exploitation Technique:
=======================
Local


Severity Level:
===============
High


Technical Details & Description:
================================
A local SEH Buffer Overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the official Blueberry Express v5.9.0.3678 software.
The vulnerability allows local or remote attacker to gain higher system or access privileges by exploitation of a
classic seh buffer overflow vulnerability.

The local SEH Buffer Overflow affects multiple products including the BBFlashBack Recorder, Batch Export etc.
Other products using similar modules might also be affected. The vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with low privilege system user account.
The attacker vector of the issue is server-side and the request method to execute the shellcode is local.

The security risk of the buffer overflow vulnerability is estimated as high with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 6.4.
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in complete compromise of the affected machine and system process.


Proof of Concept (PoC):
=======================
The buffer overflow vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with restricted system user account and without user interaction.
For security demonstration or to reproduce the security vulnerability follow the provided information and steps below to continue.

POC Description:
For POC, the researcher installed the software with admin privileges on a windows system (allowed to run for all users), while application
still running in the background, logged off and logged in with a different (low privileged) user. Exploited the vulnerability successfully
hence giving the researcher a system shell with elevated admin privileges. Privilege escalation is possible in this scenario.
Malwares wont be able to exploit this vulnerability remotely as this is a Local exploit.

Manual steps to reproduce the vulnerability ...
1) Run BB Flashback Express Recorder
2) Goto TOOLS > OPTIONS > MISC
3) Click on "Use custom folder" under the Temp Folder module
4) Copy / Paste the POC binary code (record.txt) into the input field of custom folder
5) Click OK

Note: Calculator should popup hence proving the existence of this vulnerability
