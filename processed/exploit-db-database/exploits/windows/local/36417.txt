Spybot Search & Destroy 1.6.2 Security Center Service Privilege Escalation


Vendor: Safer-Networking Ltd.
Product web page: http://www.safer-networking.org
Affected version: 1.6.2

Summary: Spybot – Search & Destroy (S&D) is a spyware and adware removal
computer program compatible with Microsoft Windows 95 and later. It scans
the computer hard disk and/or RAM for malicious software.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting
the service 'SBSDWSCService' for Windows deployed as part of Spybot S&D.
This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. A
successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot.
If successful, the local user’s code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows Ultimate 7 SP1 (EN)
