Windows NT allows users to save their RAS (and/or RRAS) credentials by using the 'Save Password' checkbox when making a dial-up connection. Credentials saved in this manner are stored in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\RasCredentials!SID#0 registry key.

These credentials can be enumerated using the LSA secrets code, as published by Paul Ashton.

If a user does not check the 'save password' checkbox to prevent the password from being stored, RAS will STILL save the successful connection information. This information includes the Dial-up username, phone number, and password, and is stored in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\RasDialParams!SID#0 registry key.

This infromation can be enumerated using the LSA secrets code.

NOTE: Administrator privileges are needed to execute the LSA secrets code.

Execute LSA Secrets (or similar) code against the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SECURITY\Policy\Secrets\RasDialParams!SID#0 registry key. Refer to NT LSA Secrets Vulnerability, July 16,1997 (http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/19195/)
