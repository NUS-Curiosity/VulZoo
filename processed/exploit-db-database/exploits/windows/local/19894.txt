Alladin Knowledge Systems eToken is a USB smartcard-like device used for authentication, file integrity, and encryption. Access to the eToken device itself and entering the PIN number encoded in the eToken will grant authorization to a local user.

The PIN number can be reset to the default value with the use of standard device programmers. This can be done by physically opening the eToken device (which can be done without leaving any trace or evidence of tampering) and copying the default PIN value to the location used to store either the user PIN or administrator PIN in the serial EEPROM.
