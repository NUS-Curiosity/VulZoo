Macrovision SafeDisc is prone to a local privilege-escalation vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary malicious code with SYSTEM-level privileges, facilitating the complete compromise of affected computers.

UPDATE: This issue affects only Microsoft Windows XP and 2003 platforms. Microsoft Vista is not affected.
