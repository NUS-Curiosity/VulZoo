# Exploit Title: Vembu StoreGrid - Unquoted Service Path Privilege Escalation
# Date: 10/19/2016
# Exploit Author: Joey Lane
# Version: 4.0
# Tested on: Windows Server 2012

StoreGrid is a re-brandable backup solution, which can install 2 services with unquoted service paths.
This enables a local privilege escalation vulnerability.
To exploit this vulnerability, a local attacker can insert an executable file in the path of either service.
Rebooting the system or restarting the service will run the malicious executable with elevated privileges.

This was tested on version 4.0, but other versions may be affected as well.

EXAMPLE:

Using the BINARY_PATH_NAME listed above as an example, an executable named
"Program.exe" could be placed in "C:\", and it would be executed as the
Local System user next time the service was restarted.
