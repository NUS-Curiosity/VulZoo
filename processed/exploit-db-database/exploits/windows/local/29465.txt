Outpost Firewall PRO is prone to a local privilege-escalation vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate SSDT (System Service Descriptor Table) hooking on files in its installation directory.

A local attacker can exploit this issue to elevate their privileges, which can lead to the complete compromise of an affected computer.

Outpost Firewall PRO 4.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
