1. Description:

The Anydesk installs as a service with an unquoted service path running with SYSTEM privileges.
This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.

2. Proof

C:\>sc qc anydesk
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: anydesk
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Program Files\AnyDesk\AnyDesk.exe --service
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : AnyDesk Service
        DEPENDENCIES       : RpcSs
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem


3. Exploit:

A successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot.
If successful, the local user's code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.
