1. Description:

NetDrive installs a service with an unquoted service path running with SYSTEM privileges.
This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local
user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system.

2. Proof

C:\>sc qc Netdrive2_Service_Netdrive2
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: Netdrive2_Service_Netdrive2
        TYPE               : 110  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS (interactive)
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Program Files\NetDrive2\nd2svc.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : NetDrive2_Service_NetDrive2
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem



3. Exploit:

A successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert their
code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other security applications
where it could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot.
If successful, the local user's code would execute with the elevated privileges
of the application.
