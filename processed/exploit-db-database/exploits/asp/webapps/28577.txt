ClickBlog! is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

ClickBlog! 2.0 and earlier versions are reported vulnerable.
