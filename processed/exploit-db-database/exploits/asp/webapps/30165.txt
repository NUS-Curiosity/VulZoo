Ibrahim Ã?AKICI Okul Portal is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

An attacker can exploit this issue by manipulating the SQL query logic to carry out unauthorized actions on the underlying database.

Ibrahim Ã?AKICI Okul Portal 2.0 is vulnerable to this issue.
