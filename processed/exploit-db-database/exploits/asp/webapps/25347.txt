Active Auction House is reportedly affected by a SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
