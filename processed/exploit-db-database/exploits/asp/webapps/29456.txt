InstantForum.NET is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

These issues affect version 4.1.0; other versions may also be affected.
