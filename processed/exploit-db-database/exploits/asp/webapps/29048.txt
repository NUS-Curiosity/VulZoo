The i-gallery application is prone to multiple-input validation vulnerabilities, including multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and an HTML-injection issue, because the software fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would execute in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

This issue affects i-gallery 3.4 and prior versions.
