Class: Cross-Site Scripting                     Severity: High


Overview:
---------
Advantech WebAccess HMI/SCADA Software Persistence Cross-Site Scripting
Vulnerability.


Technical Description:
----------------------
Advantech WebAccess HMI/SCADA Software Persistence Cross-Site Scripting
Vulnerability.

Input passed via the 'ProjDesc' parameter in 'broadWeb/include/gAddNew.asp'
(when tableName=pProject set) page is not properly verified before it is
returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and
script code in a user's browser session in the context of a vulnerable site.

The vulnerabilities are tested in Advantech WebAccess 7.0-2012.12.05 Other
versions  may also be affected.


Impact:
--------
Successful exploitation will allow a remote authenticated attacker to execute
arbitrary HTML code in a user's browser session in the context of a vulnerable
application.


Affected Software:
------------------
Advantech WebAccess HMI/SCADA Software 7.0-2012.12.05

Tested on Advantech WebAccess HMI/SCADA Software 7.0-2012.12.05 on Windows XP SP3

Proof of Concept:
-----------------

1) Login into project management interface
   http://IP-Address/broadWeb/bwconfig.asp?username=admin
2) Go to http://IP-Address/broadweb/bwproj.asp
3) Create New Project with Project Description as <script>alert("XSS")<script>
4) Now Java script '<script>alert("XSS")<script>' will be executed,
   when 'bwproj.asp' will be loaded


Solution:
----------
Fix not available
