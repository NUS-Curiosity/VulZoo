Web Wiz Forums, NewsPad, and Rich Text Editor are prone to a remote information-disclosure vulnerability because they fail to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to retrieve arbitrary files in the context of the webserver process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks; other attacks are also possible.

This issue affects Forums 9.07, NewsPad 1.02, and Rich Text Editor 4.0; other versions may also be vulnerable.
