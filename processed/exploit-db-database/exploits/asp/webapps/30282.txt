Levent Veysi Portal is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

An attacker can exploit this issue by manipulating the SQL query logic to carry out unauthorized actions on the underlying database.

This issue affects Levent Veysi Portal 1.0; other versions may also be affected.
