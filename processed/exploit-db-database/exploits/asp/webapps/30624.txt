Netkamp Emlak Scripti is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including multiple HTML-injection issues and an SQL-injection issue, because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, execute malicious script code, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
