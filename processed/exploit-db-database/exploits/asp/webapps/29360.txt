DMXReady Secure Login Manager is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

These issues affect Secure Login Manager 1.0; other versions may also be vulnerable.
