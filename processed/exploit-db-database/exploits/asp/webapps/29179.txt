Fixit iDMS Pro is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including SQL-injection issues and an HTML-injection issue, because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploits of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or even exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Other attacks are also possible.
