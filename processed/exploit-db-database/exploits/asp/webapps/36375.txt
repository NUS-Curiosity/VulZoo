Virtual Vertex Muster is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input submitted to its web interface.

Exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to view arbitrary files within the context of the webserver. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

Virtual Vertex Muster 6.1.6 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example request is available:

GET /a\..\..\muster.db HTTP/1.1
