LocazoList Classifieds is prone to an input validation vulnerability that allows cross-site scripting and SQL injection attacks.

An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.

An attacker may also leverage this issue to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in modification of query logic or other attacks. Successful exploitation could also result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
