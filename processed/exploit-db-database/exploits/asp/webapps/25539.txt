A remote SQL-injection vulnerability affects MetaCart2 because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in SQL queries.

An attacker may exploit this issue to manipulate SQL queries to the underlying database. This may allow the attacker to steal sensitive information, potentially including authentication credentials, and to corrupt data.

MetaCart2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
