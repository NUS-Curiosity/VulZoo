Ohesa Emlak Portal is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Ohesa Emlak Portal 1.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
