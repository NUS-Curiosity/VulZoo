Multiple JiRo's products are prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because they fail to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to compromise the applications, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

The following products are affected:

JBS 2.0
JBSX

Other products may also be affected.

The following proof-of-concept login and password examples are available:

admin 'or' '='
password 'or' '='
