getInternet is vulnerable to multiple remote SQL injection vulnerabilities in the 'welcome.asp', 'checklogin.asp', and 'lostpassword.asp' scripts. These issues are due to a failure of the application to properly validate user-supplied input prior to including it in an SQL query.

An attacker may exploit these issues to manipulate and inject SQL queries onto the underlying database. It is possible to leverage this issue to steal database contents including administrator password hashes and user credentials as well as to make attacks against the underlying database.

The following proof of concept examples are available:
/welcome.asp?page=content_search.asp&search=[SQL]

/welcome.asp?page=content_display.asp&id=[SQL]&category=[SQL]

/welcome.asp?page=category_display.asp&category=[SQL]

/welcome.asp?page=contact_form.asp&id=[SQL]

/checklogin.asp
username: [SQL]
password: [SQL]

/lostpassword.asp
Name: [SQL]
Surname: [SQL]
ID Number: [SQL]
