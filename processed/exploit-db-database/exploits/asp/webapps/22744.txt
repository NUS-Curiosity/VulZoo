Synkron.web is prone to HTML injection attacks. The vulnerability exists in the search script and is a result of insufficient sanitization of malicious HTML code from user-supplied input. HTML and script code may be echoed back when an existing user is views a cached search page.

Exploitation could allow for attacks that steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
