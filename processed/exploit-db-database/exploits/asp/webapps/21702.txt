Midicart ASP is a commercially available e-commerce solution distributed by Coxco Support. It is available for the Microsoft Windows operating system.

The default installation of Midicart ASP does not place sufficient access control on the midicart.mdb file. Due to this lack of access control, it is possible for a remote user to gain access to this file. This file may yield sensitive customer information, such as customer names, addresses, and credit card information.
