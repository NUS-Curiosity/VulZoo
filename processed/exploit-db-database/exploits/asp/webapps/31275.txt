Aeries Student Information System is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including multiple SQL-injection issues and an HTML-injection issue, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

These issues affect Aeries Student Information System 3.8.2.8 and 3.7.2.2; other versions may also be affected.
