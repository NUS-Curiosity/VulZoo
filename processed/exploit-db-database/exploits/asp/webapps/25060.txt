Comersus Cart is reportedly affected by multiple vulnerabilities. There is a possiblity of gaining administrator access due to a failure of the application to remove an installation script after install. There is the possiblity of SQL injection by passing a malicious HTTP referer header. There are also some possible cross-site scripting issues.

The vendor has addressed these issues in Comersus Cart version 6.0.2; earlier version are reportedly vulnerable.
