Kaseya Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability
Affected versions: < 6.3.0.2

PDF: http://security-assessment.com/files/documents/advisory/Kaseya%20File%20Upload.pdf


+-----------+
|Description|
+-----------+

Kaseya 6.3 suffers from an Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability that can be leveraged to gain remote code
execution on the Kaseya server. The code executed in this way will run with a local IUSR account’s privileges.
The vulnerability lies within the /SystemTab/UploadImage.asp file. This file constructs a file object on disk using
user input, without first checking if the user is authenticated or if input is valid. The application preserves the
file name and extension of the upload, and allows an attacker to traverse from the default destination directory.
Directory traversal is not necessary to gain code execution however, as the default path lies within the
application’s web-root.
