Snitz Forums 2000 is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

Exploiting this issue could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Version 3.4.06 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.

NOTE: This BID is being retired because further analysis reveals that this issue is not exploitable.
