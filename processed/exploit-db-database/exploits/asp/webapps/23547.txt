XtremeASP PhotoGallery is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability. The issue is reported to exist in the administration login interface, which does not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input for username and password values before including it in SQL queries. This could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries.

If we type:

Username: 'or'
Password: 'or'

We gain admin access about the password protected
administrative pages.
