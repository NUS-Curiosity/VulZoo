Acidcat CMS is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Acidcat CMS version 2.1.13 and prior are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
