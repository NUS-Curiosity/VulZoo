i-Gallery is prone to multiple directory-traversal vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Remote attackers can use a specially crafted request with directory-traversal sequences ('../') to download and read arbitrary files in the context of the webserver. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

i-Gallery 3.4 and 4.1 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
