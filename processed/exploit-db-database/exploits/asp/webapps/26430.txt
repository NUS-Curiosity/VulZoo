ZENworks Patch Management is prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

It should be noted these vulnerabilities can only be exploited if a non-privileged account has been created. Only an administrator can create such an account.
