Citrix Nfuse is an application portal server meant to provide the functionality of any application on the server via a web browser. Nfuse works in conjunction with a previously-installed webserver.

It has been reported that a remote attacker can learn the location of the webroot simply by submitting a request to the launcher application without specifying the additional required information. This has been reported to not be reliably replicable.
