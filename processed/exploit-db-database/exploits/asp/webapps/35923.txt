Paliz Portal is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is rendered to the user, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
