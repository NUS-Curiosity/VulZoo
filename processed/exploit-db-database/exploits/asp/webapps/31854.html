The Campus Request Repairs System is prone to an unauthorized-access vulnerability because it fails to adequately limit access to administrative scripts used for creating accounts.

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized administrative access to the application; other attacks are also possible.

The Campus Request Repairs System 1.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be vulnerable.
