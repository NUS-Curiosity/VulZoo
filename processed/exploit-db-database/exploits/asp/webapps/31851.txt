Campus Bulletin Board is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including multiple SQL-injection issues and a cross-site scripting issue, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Campus Bulletin Board 3.4 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
