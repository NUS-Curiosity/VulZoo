The 'husrevforum' program is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

This issue affects husrevforum v 1.0.1 (tr); other versions may be affected as well.
