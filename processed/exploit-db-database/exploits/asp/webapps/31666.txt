CoBaLT is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit may allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

CoBaLT 2.0 is affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.
