Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities affect BlaBla 4U because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in dynamically generated web content.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.
