VP-ASP Shopping Cart is prone to an HTML injection vulnerability. This is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input before being used in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be executed in the context of the affected Web site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.
