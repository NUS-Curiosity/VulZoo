IdealBB error.asp page has been reported prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

The issue presents itself due to a lack of sufficient sanitization performed by functions in the error.asp script on user-influenced URI parameters. This vulnerability may be exploited to permit the theft of cookie authentication credentials if a malicious link is followed. Other attacks may also be possible.
