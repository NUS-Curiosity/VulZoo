Cool Cafe Chat is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'login.asp' script before using it in an SQL query.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

Cool Cafe Chat 1.2.1 is reportedly vulnerable.

The following proof of concept is available:
