Infinicart is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including HTML-injection and SQL-injection issues, because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

A successful exploit of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or even exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Other attacks are also possible.

The vendor reports that these issues affect only the demonstration version of Infinicart and do not affect any official released versions of the application.
