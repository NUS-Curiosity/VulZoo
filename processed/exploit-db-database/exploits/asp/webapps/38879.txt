B2B Vertical Marketplace Creator is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

An attacker can exploit these issues by manipulating the SQL query logic to carry out unauthorized actions on the underlying database.

B2B Vertical Marketplace Creator 2.0 is vulnerable; other version may also be vulnerable.
