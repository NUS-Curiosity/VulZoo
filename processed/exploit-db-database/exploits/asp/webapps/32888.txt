Asbru Web Content Management is prone to multiple SQL-injection vulnerabilities and a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Asbru Web Content Management 6.5 and 6.6.9 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
