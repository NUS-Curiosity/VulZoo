# Exploit Title: Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 15.02 Stored XSS - Blind SQLi - RCE
# Date: Jul 22 2012
# Author: muts
# Version: Ipswitch WhatsUp Gold 15.02
# Vendor URL: http://www.ipswitch.com/

An attacker can modify their snmpd.conf file with malicious JavaScript as follows:
sysName <script>alert(124)</script>pt>>

In addition, there is a Blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the file "WrVMwareHostList.asp". By sending a specially crafted malicious JavaScript payload, the SQLi can be exploited to add a new database administrator to the system, leading to remote code execution.

Blind SQLi Proof of Concept:
WrVMwareHostList.asp?sGroupList=1;WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--&sDeviceList=3

The JavaScript code below will exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability, enable
xp_cmdshell on the target, upload a reverse shell to the target, and execute it.

Timeline:

29 May 2012: Vulnerability reported to CERT
30 May 2012: Response received from CERT with disclosure date set to 20 Jul 2012
16 Jul 2012: Email received from Ipswitch stating that the issue will be fixed ASAP
22 Jul 2012: Public Disclosure
