Cisco CallManager is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the web-interface to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an unsuspecting administrative user in the context of the affected site. This may help the attacker launch other attacks.
