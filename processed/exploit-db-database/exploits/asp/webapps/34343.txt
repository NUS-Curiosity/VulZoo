MOJO IWMS is prone to a cookie-manipulation vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to masquerade as another user. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

MOJO IWMS 7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

The following example URI is available:
