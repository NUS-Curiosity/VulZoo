Reportedly Eurofull E-Commerce is affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the 'mensresp.asp' script. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

As a result of this vulnerability, it is possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user when followed.
