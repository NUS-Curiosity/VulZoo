It has been reported that MyGuestBK does not sufficiently filter user-supplied URI parameters on the MyGuestBK Information Server 'Add Entry' page.

It may be possible for a remote attacker to create a malicious link containing script code that will be executed in the browser of a legitimate user.

This may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.
