Asp cvmatik is prone to multiple HTML-injection vulnerabilities because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would execute in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

Asp cvmatik 1.1 is vulnerable.
