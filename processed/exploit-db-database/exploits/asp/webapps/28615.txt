DotNetNuke is prone to an HTML-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code may execute in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or to control how the site is rendered to users; other attacks are also possible.

All versions of the application are vulnerable to this issue.
