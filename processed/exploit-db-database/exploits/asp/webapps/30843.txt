Absolute News Manager .NET is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities, including multiple cross-site scripting, SQL-injection, and information-disclosure issues.

Attackers can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, execute arbitrary script code in the context of the webserver process, obtain sensitive information, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

These issues affect Absolute News Manager .NET 5.1; other versions may also be vulnerable.
