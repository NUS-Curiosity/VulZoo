Comersus BackOfficePlus and BackOfficeLite are prone to multiple input validation and information disclosure vulnerabilities.

The applications are prone to SQL injection attacks, information disclosure and multiple cross-site scripting attacks.

An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to retrieve sensitive and privileged information, gain access to the application as an administrative user and perform cross-site scripting attacks to retrieve cookie-based authentication credentials from victim users; other attacks are also possible.
