AspDotNetStorefront is reportedly prone to an access validation vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary contents from a vulnerable Web site. The issue occurs because the 'deleteicon.aspx' script does not validate access before allowing an unprivileged user to delete contents such as icons and images from the site.

Other attacks may be possible as well, however, this has not been confirmed.

AspDotNetStorefront 3.3 is reportedly affected by this issue, however, it is possible that other versions are affected as well.
