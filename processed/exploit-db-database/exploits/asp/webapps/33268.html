AfterLogic WebMail Pro is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials; other attacks are also possible.

AfterLogic WebMail Pro 4.7.10 and prior versions are affected.
