Douran Portal is prone to an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability and a cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit these issues to upload and execute arbitrary ASP code in the context of the webserver process, steal cookie-based authentication information, execute arbitrary client-side scripts in the context of the browser, and obtain sensitive information. Other attacks are also possible.

Douran Portal versions 3.9.7.55 and prior are vulnerable.
