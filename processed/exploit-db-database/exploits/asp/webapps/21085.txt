Details.
The web application is vulnerable to multiple security
vulnerabilities, such as Unauthenticated File Upload and
XML eXternal Entities (XXE) injection.

1.Unauthenticated File Upload:
The form /WorkArea/Upload.aspx does not require authentication
to upload a file. By issuing a POST request with a webshell
embedded in a JPEG image and specifying the ASPX extension it is
possible to upload ASPX code to /uploadedimages/. The ASPX code
is placed in the comment section of the JPEG so that it survives
image resizing.

2.XXE Injection:
The XML parser at /WorkArea/Blogs/xmlrpc.aspx is vulnerable to
XML external entity attacks which can be used to Scan behind
perimeter firewalls or possibly include files from the local file
system e.g.
<!DOCTYPE scan [<!ENTITY test SYSTEM "http://localhost:22">]>
<scan>&test;</scan>

Solution.
Upgrade to version 8.6 and remove the /WorkArea/Blogs/xmlrpc.aspx file.
