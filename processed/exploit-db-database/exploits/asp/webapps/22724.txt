Several software products maintained by Xpressions Interactive are prone to SQL injection attacks.

The vulnerability exists in the login.asp page. Specifically, user-supplied input is not sufficiently sanitized of malicious SQL queries.

An attacker may exploit this vulnerability to insert SQL code into requests and have the SQL code executed by the underlying database server.
