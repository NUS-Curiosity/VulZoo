Dora Emlak Script is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including HTML-injection and SQL-injection issues, because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, execute arbitrary script code in the context of the webserver process, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, obtain sensitive information, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

Dora Emlak Script v1.0 is vulnerable.
