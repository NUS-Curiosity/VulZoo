3.Vulnerability Description

CactuShop is an ASP shopping cart designed to provide a powerful base for e-commerce web sites hosted on Microsoft Windows web servers. A Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered in CactuShop. This vulnerability occurs in the file that processes the user invoices (_invoice.asp). A malicious user can abuse of this flaw by requesting for an invoice and thus tricking an admin user into issuing him an invoice.

4. Vulnerable packages

    * CactuShop v6.1.
    * Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. Non-vulnerable packages

    * CactuShop v6.155.

6. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

The change made to the file _invoice.asp was to use the WriteSafe function on lines 88 and 100:

	87  ...
	88  O_BillingAddress = WriteSafe(replace(O_BillingAddress, vbcrlf & vbcrlf, vbcrlf))

	99  ...
	100  O_ShippingAddress = WriteSafe(replace(O_ShippingAddress, vbcrlf & vbcrlf, vbcrlf))

This function HTML encodes any code an attacker might try to insert into the addresses to be run. This patch was applied to CactuShop v6.155.

7. Credits

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by 7Safe.
