JiRos Links Manager is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including SQL- and HTML-injection issues, because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation; other attacks are possible.
