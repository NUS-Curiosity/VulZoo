A remote SQL injection vulnerability reportedly affects ASP-Rider Web blog. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input prior to including it in SQL queries.

An attacker may exploit this issue to manipulate SQL queries to the underlying database. This may facilitate theft sensitive information, potentially including authentication credentials, and data corruption.
