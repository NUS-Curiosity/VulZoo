Acuity CMS is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability and an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit these issues to obtain sensitive information, to upload arbitrary code, and run it in the context of the webserver process.

Acuity CMS 2.6.2 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.
