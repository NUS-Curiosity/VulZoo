DUportal/DUportal SQL are prone to multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities. These issues exist because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

Successful exploitation could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.

These vulnerabilities are reported to affect DUportal/DUportal SQL 3.1.2; earlier versions may also be affected.
