  Associated CWE:
  CWE-200: Information Exposure - http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html

  2) CVE-2014-4312
  Persistent and reflective cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks possible:
  The identified website is vulnerable to persistent and reflective cross-site
scripting. Script injection is a weakness within an application, and is due to
insufficient validation of the input data (i.e. input data being sent from the
user/presentation layer) and output encoding allowing dynamic execution of
scripts on the application front end resulting in anomalous/abnormal behaviour
of the application.

  Example of affected functionalities for persistent XSS:
   - 1. While viewing Order details, and injecting a malicious payload on the
"Notes" section.
   - 2. While modifying an “Order to consume” and injecting a malicious payload
on the "Description" section.
   - 3. While observing the “Favorites” section and and injecting a malicious
payload on the “Favorites name” section.
     Example of an injected payload: <script>alert("XSS")</script>

  Example of affected URLs for reflective XSS:
  - 1.
https://XXXXX/Procurement/EKPHTML/search_item_bt.asp?RecordsRequested=Yes&FiltPartNo=&FiltSupplier=-1&FiltKeyword=<script>alert("XSS")</script>
  - 2.
https://XXXXX/Procurement/EKPHTML/EnterpriseManager/Budget/ImportBudget_fr.asp?Act=dtt"><script>alert("XSS")</script>
  - 3. https://XXXXX
