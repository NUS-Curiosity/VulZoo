Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in the application that may allow an attacker to obtain the private cryptographic key and gain access to sensitive information. The application is also reported prone to an SQL injection vulnerability that may allow an attacker to gain administrative level access to the underlying database.

The issues exist due to improper implementation of the RSA cryptosystem by SpiderSales and failure to sanitize user-supplied input via the 'userId' URI parameter employed by various scripts.

SpiderSales version 2.0 is assumed to be vulnerable to these issues, however, other versions could be affected as well.
