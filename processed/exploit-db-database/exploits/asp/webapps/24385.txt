Zixforum is reported prone to a database disclosure vulnerability. It is reported that remote users may download the database file ''ZixForum.mdb' and gain access to sensitive information including unencrypted authentication credentials.

All versions of Zixforum are considered vulnerable to this issue.

This issue is being retired due to the fact that this is not a vulnerability in the application. Configuring the Web server to restrict access to sensitive files can prevent this problem.
