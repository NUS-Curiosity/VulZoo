It has been reported that the VGW4/8 Telephony Gateway is prone to a remote authentication bypass vulnerability via its web configuration tool. The problem is due to a design error in the application that allows a user to access configuration pages without prior authentication.

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow a remote attacker to gain control of the affected appliance via its web configuration tool.
