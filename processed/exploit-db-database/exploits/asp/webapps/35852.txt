Microsoft Lync Server 2010 is prone to a remote command-injection vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the application.

Microsoft Lync Server 2010 version 4.0.7577.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
