An SQL injection vulnerability is identified in the application that may allow attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in the modification of query logic or other attacks.

This issue exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input through the Cookie object.

Successful exploitation could result in compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. An attacker may gain access to the administrative username and password and execute arbitrary database commands as well.

Web+Center version 4.0.1 is affected by this vulnerability. Other versions may be affected as well.
