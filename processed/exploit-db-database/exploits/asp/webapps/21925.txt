SurfControl SuperScout Email Filter comes with a web-based interface to provide remote access to administrative facilities.

One of the files (userlist.asp) that comes with the web interface contains a listing of administrative usernames/passwords. Users who can access this file will gain access to authentication credentials for other users.
