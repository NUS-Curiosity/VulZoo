It is reported that Mono is prone to various cross-site scripting attacks. These issues result from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data and arise when Mono converts Unicode characters ranging from U+ff00-U+ff60 to ASCII.

Mono 1.0.5 is reported vulnerable, however, other versions may be affected as well.
