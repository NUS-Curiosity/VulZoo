Affected Product(s):
===============
Erlyvideo, LLC
Product: Flussonic Media Server 4.1.25 - 4.3.3

Exploitation Technique:
==================
AFR:    Remote, Unauthenticated
ADL:    Remote, Authenticated

Severity Level:
===========
High

Technical Details & Description:
========================
1. Arbitrary File Read (Unauthenticated)
It’s possible to read any files from the server (with the application’s user’s permissions) by a simple HTTP GET request. Flussonic’s web interface login information can be found as plaintext by reading /etc/flussonic/flussonic.conf; thus, it’s possible to login any Flussonic web interface using that method.

2. Arbitrary Directory Listing (Authenticated)
It’s possible to list any directories’ content sending a HTTP GET request to “flussonic/api/list_files” with the parameter “subpath=directory”.
