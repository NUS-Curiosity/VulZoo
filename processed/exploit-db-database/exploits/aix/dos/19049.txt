A vulnerability exists in inetd which allows a remote user to crash inetd if the tcpmux service is not commented
out of /etc/inetd.conf. The tcpmux service is defined in RFC1078

$ nmap -p 1-64000 -i <target host>

It is also claimed inetd will die if the Windows 95/NT
program postscan.exe, made by 7thsphere, is run againts
the host.
