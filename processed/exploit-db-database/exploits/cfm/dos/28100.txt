BlueDragon is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability. This issue is due to the application's failure to efficiently handle malformed GET requests.

An attacker can exploit this issue to cause the service to stop responding, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

This issue affects version 6.2.1.286; other versions may also be vulnerable.
