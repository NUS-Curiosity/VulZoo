FuseTalk is prone to an SQL-injection vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database.

NOTE: Specific vulnerable versions were not disclosed. Reports also indicate that this issue has been addressed in the latest version of the application.
