E-Publish is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in a compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data, the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. They may also permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation as well as other attacks.

This issue reportedly affects version 2.0 of E-Publish; other versions may also be affected.
