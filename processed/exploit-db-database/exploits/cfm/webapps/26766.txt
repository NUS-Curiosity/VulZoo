CF_Nuke is prone to a local file include vulnerability. This is due to a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.

This may facilitate the unauthorized viewing of files and unauthorized execution of local ColdFusion code.

It should be noted that successful exploitation requires that "Sandbox Security" is not enabled for the directory.

CF_Nuke 4.6 and prior versions are reported to be vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
