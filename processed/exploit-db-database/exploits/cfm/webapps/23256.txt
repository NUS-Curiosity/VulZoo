It has been reported that Macromedia ColdFusion MX may be prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability due to improper handling of error messages generated by the underlying database. This problem may be exploited by an attacker to construct a malicious link containing HTML or script code that may be rendered in a user's browser upon visiting that link. If successful, an attacker may obtain access to cookie-based authentication credentials that may lead to other attacks. This attack would occur in the security context of the vulnerable site.

Macromedia ColdFusion MX version 6.0 may be vulnerable to this issue, however other versions may be affected as well.
