Novell GroupWise is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities, including multiple remote code-execution vulnerabilities, an information-disclosure issue, and a cross-site scripting issue.

Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, obtain potentially sensitive information, or execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the affected application. Information harvested may aid in further attacks; other attacks are also possible.
