The Novell Client ActiveX control is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because of an unspecified error.

A successful attack allows a remote attacker to crash an application that is using the ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer), denying further service to legitimate users.

Novell Client 4.91.5.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
