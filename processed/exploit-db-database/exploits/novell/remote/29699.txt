Novell Access Management SSLVPN Server is prone to a security-bypass vulnerability.

A remote authenticated attacker can exploit this issue to access corporate resources normally restricted within VPN access policy. This may lead to other attacks.

This issue affects version 3 IR1 of Novell Access Management Server.

A proof-of-concept modification to 'policy.txt' would be as follows:

sslize {
from : 0.0.0.0 / 0
to :10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
port : 80
protocol :tcp
action :allow
};

The above example demonstrates how an attacker would allow their client machine HTTP access to any host on the remote network.
