Novell GroupWise WebAccess is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting these issues may allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks on unsuspecting users in the context of the affected website. As a result, the attacker may be able to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks.

Novell GroupWise WebAccess 7 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
