Novell eDirectory is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

Novell eDirectory 8.8 SP5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
