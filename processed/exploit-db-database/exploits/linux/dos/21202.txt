Anti-Web HTTPD is a freely available, open source web server designed for use on the Linux platform. It is maintained by Doug Hoyte.

Under certain circumstances awhttpd reacts unpredictably.

When a script is executed that opens a file that does not exist, awhttpd still attempts to open the file. When awhttpd attempts to close the non-existing file following the completion of the script, it becomes unstable and crashes, resulting in a denial of service.

a sample awhttpd script looks like this:
# test.cgi
--AWHTTPD SCRIPT--
echo "this is a test"
F:test.html
