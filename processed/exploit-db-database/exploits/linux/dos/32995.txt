Sendmail is prone to a heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to adequately bounds-check user-supplied input before copying it to an insufficiently sized buffer.

Successfully exploiting this issue may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely crash the application.

Versions prior to Sendmail 8.13.2 are vulnerable.
