BIND is the Berkeley Internet Name Daemon, a free Name Resolution software package maintained by the Internet Software Consortium. A Denial of Service exists in current implementations.

The problem occurs in the Compressed Zone Transfer (ZXFR) functionality of BIND. A default installation of BIND does not support the transfer of compressed zone files. However, daemon that allows zone transfers and recursive queries will crash if queried for a compressed zone transfer that is not in the nameserver cache. This could result in a name resolution Denial of Service for all users and systems depending upon nameservers using the affected software.
