CoolPlayer is prone a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

The issue occurs when handling specially crafted OGG files.

Successfully exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed exploit attempts likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

CoolPlayer 217 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
