The xine package is reported prone to a remote format-string vulnerability.

This issue arises when the application handles specially crafted playlist files. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious file that contains format specifiers and then sending the file to an unsuspecting user.

A successful attack may crash the application or lead to arbitrary code execution.

All versions of xine are considered vulnerable at the moment.
