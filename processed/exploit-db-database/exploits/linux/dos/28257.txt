GnuPG is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

This issue may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of the affected application, but this has not been confirmed.

GnuPG version 1.4.4 is vulnerable to this issue; previous versions may also be affected.
