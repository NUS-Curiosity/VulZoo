# census ID: census-2009-0003
# URL: http://census-labs.com/news/2009/12/02/corehttp-web-server/
# CVE ID: CVE-2009-3586
# Affected Products: CoreHTTP web server versions buffer,
# 46: "%" PATHSIZE_S "[A-Za-z] %" PATHSIZE_S "s%*[ \t\n]", req, url);
#
# The buffers req and url are declared to be of size 256 bytes (PATHSIZE)
# and the sscanf() call writes 256 bytes (PATHSIZE_S) to these buffers
# without NULL terminating them.
#
# Note that this is not vulnerability CVE-2007-4060 in which the same
# sscanf() call contained no bounds check at all.
#
# This vulnerability can lead to denial of service attacks against the
# CoreHTTP web server and potentially to the remote execution of
# arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the server. We
# have developed a proof-of-concept exploit to demonstrate the
# vulnerability:

#
# For the time being, one may use the following workaround to address this
# issue, until an official fix is released by the author:
