GNU 'binutils' is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

Remote attackers may crash the 'strings' utility, potentially making analysis of malicious binaries more difficult. Attackers may also execute arbitrary machine code in the context of applications that use the affected library.
