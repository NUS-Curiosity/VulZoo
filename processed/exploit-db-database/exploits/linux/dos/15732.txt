FontForge is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data before copying it into an insufficiently sized buffer.

An attacker could exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

FontForge 0.0.20100501-2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
