Adobe Reader and Acrobat are prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability because they fail to properly handle certain COM objects.

An attacker can exploit this issue by supplying a malicious PDF file or webpage. Successful exploits may allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of a user running the affected application. Failed attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

This issue was previously covered in BID 36638 (Adobe Reader and Acrobat October 2009 Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities), but has been given its own record to better document it.
