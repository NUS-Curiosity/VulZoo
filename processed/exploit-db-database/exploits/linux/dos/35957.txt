The Auerswald USB Device Driver for the Linux kernel is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges, facilitating the complete compromise of affected computers. Failed exploit attempts will likely crash the kernel, denying service to legitimate users.

Linux kernel 2.6.26 is vulnerable; prior versions may also be affected.

0xbf, 0x09, /*  u16 idVendor; */
0xc0, 0x00, /*  u16 idProduct; */
0x10, 0x42, /*  u16 bcdDevice */

case 1:
      /* serial number */
      ret = set_usb_string(data, ��);
          break;
      case 2:
          ret = set_usb_string(data,�AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA�);
