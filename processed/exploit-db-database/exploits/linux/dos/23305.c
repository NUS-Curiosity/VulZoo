A vulnerability has been reported in thttpd that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable host. The issue is reported to exist due to a lack of bounds checking by software, leading to a buffer overflow condition. The problem is reported to exist in the defang() function in libhttpd.c.

This issue may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a vulnerable host. Successful exploitation of this issue may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the web server in order to gain unauthorized access to a vulnerable system.

thttpd versions 2.21 to 2.23b1 have been reported to be prone to this issue, however other versions may be affected as well.
