OpenLDAP get_ber_next Denial of Service
Affected Versions: OpenLDAP <= 2.4.42

+-------------+
| Description |
+-------------+
By sending a crafted packet, an attacker may cause the OpenLDAP server to reach an assert() statement, crashing
the daemon. This was tested on OpenLDAP 2.4.42 (built with GCC 4.9.2) and OpenLDAP 2.4.40 installed from the Debian
package repository.

+--------------+
| Exploitation |
+--------------+
By sending a crafted packet, an attacker can cause the OpenLDAP daemon to crash with a SIGABRT. This is due to an
assert() call within the ber_get_next method (io.c line 682) that is hit when decoding tampered BER data.

The following proof of concept exploit can be used to trigger the condition:

--[ Exploit POC
echo "/4SEhISEd4MKYj5ZMgAAAC8=" | base64 -d | nc -v 127.0.0.1 389

The above causes slapd to abort as follows when running with '-d3', however it should be noted that this will crash
the server even when running in daemon mode.

--[ sladp -d3
