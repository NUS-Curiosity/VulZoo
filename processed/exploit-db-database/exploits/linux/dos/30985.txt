The GNU Compact Disc Input and Control Library ('libcdio') is prone to multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

The issues occur when the 'cd-info' and 'iso-info' programs handle specially crafted ISO files.

Successfully exploiting these issues may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed exploit attempts likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

The issues affect libcdio 0.79; other versions may also be affected.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. mkdir -p tmp/dir1
2. echo file_with_really_really_long_silly_name_to_test_iso_info_buffer
3. mkisofs -J -R -volid My_Image -o test.iso tmp
4. iso-info -l test.iso
