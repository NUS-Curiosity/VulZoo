GNOME Rhythmbox is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to handle specially crafted input.

Exploiting this issue allows remote attackers to crash the application and trigger denial-of-service conditions, denying further service to legitimate users. Given the nature of this issue, code execution may be possible, but this has not been confirmed.

GNOME Rhythmbox 0.11.5 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
