# Exploit Author: Juan Sacco - http://www.exploitpack.com <jsacco@exploitpack.com>
# Program: fbzx - ZX Spectrum Emulator for X
# Tested on: GNU/Linux - Kali Linux 2.0 x86
#
# Description: FBZX v2.10 and prior is prone to a stack-based buffer overflow
# vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate
# boundary-checks on user-supplied input.
#
# An attacker could exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the
# context of the application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a
# denial-of-service condition.
