Mozilla Firefox is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability.

Successful exploits may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 36843 (Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey MFSA 2009-52 through -64 Multiple Vulnerabilities), but has been assigned its own record to better document it.
