Multiple vendors' Telnet client applications are reported prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability reportedly occurs in the 'env_opt_add()' function in the 'telnet.c' source file, which is apparently common source for all the affected vendors.

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on some of the affected platforms in the context of a user that is using the vulnerable Telnet client to connect to a malicious server.
