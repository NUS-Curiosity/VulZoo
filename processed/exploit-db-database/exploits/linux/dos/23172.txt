The Gauntlet Firewall SQL gateway (sql-gw) is prone to denial of service attacks. It is possible to trigger this condition by making multiple connections to the port which the service listens on. The service will need to be restarted to regain normal functionality.

This issue was reported for Gauntlet Firewall version 6, running on Solaris. Other versions may also be affected.
