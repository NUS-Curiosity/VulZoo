MySQL is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the database, denying access to legitimate users.

Versions prior to MySQL 5.1.49 are vulnerable.

NOTE: This issue was previously disclosed in BID 42586 (Oracle MySQL Prior to 5.1.49 Multiple Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities) but has been assigned its own record.
