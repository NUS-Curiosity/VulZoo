Inktomi Traffic Server is a transparent web caching application. It is designed for use with Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating environments.

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in the Inktomi Traffic Server. The vulnerability occurs in the traffic_manager binary included with Inktomi Traffic Server.

Reportedly, executing traffic_manager with an excessively long commandline argument will cause the buffer overflow condition. As traffic_manager is a setuid root binary, it is possible for a remote attacker to obtain root, or superuser, privileges on a compromised system.
