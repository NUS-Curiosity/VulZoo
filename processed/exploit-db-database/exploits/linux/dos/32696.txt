KDE Konqueror is prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, or cause the affected browser to crash.

KDE Konqueror 4.1 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
