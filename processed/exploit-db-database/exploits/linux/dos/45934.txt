# Version: 0.6 -> 4.0
# Tested on: 4.0
# CVE: CVE-2018-19290

# 1. Description
# In modules/HELPBOT_MODULE in Budabot 0.6 through 4.0, lax syntax validation
# allows remote attackers to perform a command injection attack against the
# PHP daemon with a crafted command, resulting in a denial of service or
# possibly unspecified other impact. In versions before 3.0,
# modules/HELPBOT_MODULE/calc.php has the vulnerable code; in 3.0 and above,
# modules/HELPBOT_MODULE/HelpbotController.class.php has the vulnerable code.

# 2. Proof of Concept

Start the Budabot listener, set valid configuration options, and wait for
the chatbot to announce it's ready in-game.
Send the chatbot a private message containing "!calc 5 x 5", and the
Budabot listener will terminate.
