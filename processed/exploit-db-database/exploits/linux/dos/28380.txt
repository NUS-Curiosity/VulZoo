Mozilla Firefox is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability. This issue is due to a race condition that may result in double-free or other memory-corruption issues.

Attackers may likely exploit this issue to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of the vulnerable application, but this has not been confirmed. Failed exploit attempts will likely crash the application.

Mozilla Firefox is vulnerable to this issue. Due to code reuse, other Mozilla products are also likely affected.
