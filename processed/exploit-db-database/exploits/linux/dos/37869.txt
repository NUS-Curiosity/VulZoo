The attached sample, signal_sigsegv_7ffff60a1429_9554_f4dc661554237404dfe394d4c6c3e674.swf, crashes in this manner on Linux x64:

=> 0x00007f693158481f:	movzbl (%rcx),%r11d
rcx            0x3102ffffecfd	53888954658045

The base sample from which this fuzz case was generated is also attached. We believe this may be related to button handling.
