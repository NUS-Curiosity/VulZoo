MySQL is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to handle certain specially crafted queries.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash the application, denying access to legitimate users.

NOTE: An attacker must be able to execute arbitrary SELECT statements against the database to exploit this issue. This may be through legitimate means or by exploiting other latent SQL-injection vulnerabilities.

Versions prior to MySQL 5.0.40 are vulnerable.

SELECT id from example WHERE id IN(1, (SELECT IF(1=0,1,2/0)));
