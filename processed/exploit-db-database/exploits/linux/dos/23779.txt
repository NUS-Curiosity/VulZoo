Grep <2.11 is vulnerable to int overflow exploitation.

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-grep/2012-03/msg00007.html

Although it is patched in the recent Grep,
This update has not been pushed to the Ubuntu repos, or the Redhat
repos, leaving 99% of those OS's(and more) vulnerable.


There are also many other ways to do this bug.

It is low severity because it would be extremely hard to actually
exploit it, and it is a local exploit, and it is not run by root.
