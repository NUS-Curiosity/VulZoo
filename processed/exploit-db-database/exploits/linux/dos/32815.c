The Linux kernel is prone to an origin-validation weakness when dealing with signal handling.

This weakness occurs when a privileged process calls attacker-supplied processes as children. Attackers may exploit this to send arbitrary signals to the privileged parent process.

A local attacker may exploit this issue to kill vulnerable processes, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. In some cases, other attacks may also be possible.

Linux kernel 2.6.28 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
