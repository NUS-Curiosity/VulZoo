KDE libkhtml is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

This issue is triggered when an attacker convinces a victim user to open a malicious HTML document via an affected application such as kmail or Konqueror.

Remote attackers may exploit this issue to crash applications that use the affected library, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
