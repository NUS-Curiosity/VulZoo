A vulnerability has been reported in srcpd that allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by exploiting an integer overflow error. The exploitation of this problem would consist of an attacker connecting to a server and issuing the "go" command with a large integer value, causing an overflow condition.

This issue would lead to a denial of service. Execution of arbitrary code may well be possible.

Srcpd v2.0 has been reported to be vulnerable to this issue, however older version may be affected as well.
