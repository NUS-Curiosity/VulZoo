Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird are prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability that attackers can exploit to cause denial-of-service conditions and possibly execute arbitrary code.

The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 3.0.12 and 3.5. Note that Thunderbird is also affected but Mozilla hasn't specified the vulnerable and fixed versions.

This vulnerability was previously covered in BID 35758 (Mozilla Firefox MFSA 2009-34, -35, -36, -37, -39, -40 Multiple Vulnerabilities) but has been assigned its own record to better document the issue.
