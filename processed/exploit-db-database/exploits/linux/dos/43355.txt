[CONVISO-17-002] - Zoom Linux Client Stack-based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

1. Advisory Information
    Conviso Advisory ID: CONVISO-17-002
    CVE ID: CVE-2017-15048
    CVSS v2: 6.8, (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
    Date: 2017-10-01

2. Affected Components
    Zoom client for Linux, version 2.0.106600.0904 (zoom_amd64.deb). Other versions may be
    vulnerable.

3. Description
    The binary /opt/zoom/ZoomLauncher is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it concatenates a
    overly long user input to a stack variable without checking if the destination buffer is long
    enough to hold the data.
    The binary also has important security features like canary turned off.
    The client registers a scheme handler (zoommtg://) and this makes possible to trigger the
    vulnerability remotely.
