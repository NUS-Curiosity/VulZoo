Mozilla Suite/Firefox are reported prone to a memory-disclosure vulnerability. This issue can allow a remote attacker to access arbitrary heap memory.

Due to an error in the way 'replace()' handles lambda expressions, a remote attacker can access arbitrary heap memory from a vulnerable client.

Information harvested in this manner could then aid in further attacks launched against the vulnerable computer (such as memory-corruption exploits).

Firefox versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 are reported vulnerable. Mozilla 1.7.6 is vulnerable as well. Other versions may also be affected.

K-Meleon 0.9 is vulnerable to this issue. Older versions may be affected as well.

Camino 0.8.3 is affected by this issue. Other versions of Camino may be affected as well.

var rx=/val/i;
x = x.replace(rx,function($1){
$1.match(rx);

});
