LibTIFF is prone to a denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to properly validate user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit this issue to crash an application that uses the vulnerable library, denying service to legitimate users. Due to the nature of this issue, attackers may be able to execute arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

Versions up to and including libTIFF 3.9.4 are vulnerable.
