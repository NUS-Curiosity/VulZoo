Wireshark is prone to multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities.

Exploiting these issues may allow attackers to cause crashes and deny service to legitimate users of the application. Attackers may be able to leverage some of these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, but this has not been confirmed.

These issues affect Wireshark 0.99.2 up to and including 0.99.8.
