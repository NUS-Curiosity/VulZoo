Nfdump Nfcapd Multiple Vulnerabilities
Affected Versions: Nfdump <= 1.6.14

+-------------+
| Description |
+-------------+
This document details multiple vulnerabilities found within the nfcapd netflow collector daemon. An unauthenticated
attacker may leverage these vulnerabilities to trigger a denial of service condition within the nfcapd daemon. Two
read based heap overflow vulnerabilities were found within the IPFIX processing code and one logic based denial of
service was found in the Netflow V9 processing code.

+--------------+
| Exploitation |
+--------------+
== Process_ipfix_template_add heap overflow ==
By tampering the flowset_length parameter within an IPFIX packet, an attacker can trigger a denial of service condition
within nfcapd. Line 931 in file ipfix.c decrements the size_left value by 4, and by triggering a condition where the
initial value is less than 4, eg. 1 as in the below POC, an integer underflow occurs. This wraps the size_left value
(indicating the remaining packet payload to be processed) to 4294967293, resulting in nfcapd continuously processing the
heap-based buffer allocated for the input packet (allocated at line 381 of nfcapd.c) until it eventually hits invalid
memory and crashes with a segmentation fault.

--[ Process_ipfix_template_add heap overflow POC
echo "AAoABQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAAUAAAABAA==" | base64 -d | nc -u 127.0.0.1 <port>

== Process_ipfix_option_templates heap overflow ==
By submitting an IPFIX packet with a flowset id of 3 and a large scope_field_count parameter (65535 in the below POC),
nfcapd will continuously process the heap-based buffer allocated for the packet, eventually hitting an invalid memory
address and crashing with a segmentation fault. The scope_field_count is taken directly from the packet (line 1108,
ipfix.c) and is subsequently used in the for loop processing the packet contents (line 1138, ipfix.c)

--[ Process_ipfix_option_templates heap overflow POC
echo "AAoAAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADAAoA/wAA//8AAAAAAAA=" | base64 -d | nc -u 127.0.0.1 <port>

== Process_v9_data infinite loop ==
By sending a crafted packet, an attacker can cause the nfcapd daemon to enter an infinite loop. As well as consuming a
considerable amount of processing power, this infinite loop will eventually exhaust all available disk space. Once disk
space is exhausted, the nfcapd daemon will exit.

The infinite loop is triggered due to the table->input_record_size variable being set to zero. As the Process_v9_data
method processes the packet, table->input_record_size is subtracted from the size_left variable, with the intention being
that once size_left is zero the processing is concluded. As size_left is being decremented by zero each loop, this while
loop (line 1529, netflow_v9.c) runs infinitely.

--[ Process_v9_data infinite loop POC
echo "AAkAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAYA/w==" | base64 -d | nc -u 127.0.0.1 <port>
