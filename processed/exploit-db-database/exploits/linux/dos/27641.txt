Opera is prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to the application's failure to properly bounds-check user-supplied input before using it in a string-copy operation.

This issue allows remote attackers to crash affected web browsers. Due to the nature of this issue, attackers may be able to exploit this issue to execute machine code, but this has not been confirmed.

Opera version 8.52 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
