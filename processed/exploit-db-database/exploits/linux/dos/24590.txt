Apache 2.x mod_ssl is reported prone to a remote denial of service vulnerability. This issue likely exists because the application fails to handle exceptional conditions. The vulnerability originates in the 'char_buffer_read' function of the 'ssl_engine_io.c' file.

It is likely that this issue only results in a denial of service condition in child process. This BID will be updated as more information becomes available.

Apache 2.0.50 is reported to be affected by this issue, however, it is possible that other versions are vulnerable as well.
