Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Apache OpenMeetings 1.9.x - 3.1.0

Description:
The Import/Export System Backups functionality in the OpenMeetings
Administration menu (http://domain:5080/openmeetings/#admin/backup) is vulnerable to path
traversal via specially crafted file names within ZIP archives.

By uploading an archive containing a file named ../../../public/hello.txt will write
the file "hello.txt" to the http://domain:5080/openmeetings/public/ directory. This could
be used to, for example, overwrite the /usr/bin/convert file (or any other 3 rd party
integrated executable) with a shell script, which would be executed the next time an image
file is uploaded and imagemagick is invoked.

All users are recommended to upgrade to Apache OpenMeetings 3.1.1
