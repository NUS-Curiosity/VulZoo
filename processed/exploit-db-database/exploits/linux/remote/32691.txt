Audio File Library ('libaudiofile') is prone to a heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied data.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of applications using the vulnerable library. Failed exploit attempts will likely cause denial-of-service conditions.

This issue affects libaudiofile 0.2.6; other versions may also be vulnerable.
