The Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 apache package by default allows anyone to view /usr/doc via the web, remotely. This is because srm.conf is preconfigured with the line:

Alias /doc/ /usr/doc/

Boa is also preconfigured this way.


lynx http://some.host/doc

This will provide you with all of the information in /usr/doc, which could be used to find vulnerable software on the remote machine.
