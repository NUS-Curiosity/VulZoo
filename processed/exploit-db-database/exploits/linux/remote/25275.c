Smail-3 is reported prone to multiple vulnerabilities. These issues can allow a local or remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable computer. A successful attack may lead to a complete compromise.

The following specific issues were identified:

Smail-3 is vulnerable to a remote heap overflow vulnerability. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges. Attack attempts may also trigger a denial of service condition.

The application is also reported prone to various potential vulnerabilities arising from insecure handling of heap memory by signal handlers. These issues are not confirmed at the moment.

Smail-3 3.2.0.120 is affected by these issues. Other versions may be vulnerable.

This BID will be updated when more information becomes available.

 * Shouts:

 * BMF, wipe with the left, eat with the right
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * You can't have any characters in overflow buffer that isspace() returns true
 * for.  The shellcode is clear of them, but if your return address or retloc
 * has one you gotta figure out another one.  My slack box has that situation,
 * heap is at 0x080d.. My gentoo laptop had no such problem and all was fine.  I
 * don't have anymore time to BS around with this and make perfect for any and
 * all, b/c I've got exam to study for and Law and Order:CI is on in an hour.
 * If the heap you're targetting is the same way, then try filling it up using
 * some other commands.  If the GOT you're targetting is at such address than
 * overwrite a return address on the stack.  Surely there's a way, check out the
 * source and be creative; I'm sure there are some memory leaks somewhere you
 * can use to fill up heap as well.
 *
 * You might run into some ugliness trying to automate this for a couple
 * reasons.  xmalloc() stores a cookie in front of buffer, and xfree() checks
 * for this cookie before calling free().  So you're going to need that aligned
 * properly unless you can cook up a way to exploit it when it bails out in
 * xfree() b/c of bad cookie and calls write_log() (this func calls malloc() so
 * maybe you can be clever and do something there). Furthermore I found that
 * when trying to trigger this multiple times the alignment was different each
 * time.  There are "definitely" more reliable ways to exploit this if you take
 * a deeper look into code which I don't have time to do right now.  The padding
 * parameter controls the alignment and the size of the chunk being allocated.
 * You'll probably have to play with it.  Yes that's fugly.
