Info-ZIP UnZip contains a vulnerability during the handling of pathnames for archived files. Specifically, when certain encoded characters are inserted into '../' directory traversal sequences, the creator of the archive can cause the file to be extracted to arbitrary locations on the filesystem - including paths containing system binaries and other sensitive or confidential information.
