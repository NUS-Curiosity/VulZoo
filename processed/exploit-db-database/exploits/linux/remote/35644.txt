Viola DVR is prone to multiple directory-traversal vulnerabilities because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting the issues can allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information that could aid in further attacks.

Viola DVR VIO-4/1000 is vulnerable; other products may also be affected.
