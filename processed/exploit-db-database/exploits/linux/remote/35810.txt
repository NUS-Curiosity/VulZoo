The 'libxml2' library is prone to multiple memory-corruption vulnerabilities, including one that can trigger a heap-based buffer-overflow error and an integer-overflow condition.



An attacker can exploit these issues by enticing an unsuspecting user into opening a specially crafted XML file that contains a malicious XPath.



A successful attack can allow attacker-supplied code to run in the context of the application using the vulnerable library or can cause a denial-of-service condition.
