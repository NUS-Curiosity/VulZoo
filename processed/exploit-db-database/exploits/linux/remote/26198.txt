Astaro Security Linux is prone to a weakness that may allow remote attackers to connect to arbitrary ports on a vulnerable computer.

This weakness may be combined with other attacks to exploit latent vulnerabilities. An attacker can bypass access controls implemented by the application through this attack.

Astaro Security Linux 6.001 is prone to this weakness.

Connect to TCP port 8080 and enter the following command:

CONNECT localhost:80 HTTP/1.0
