Newsgrab is reported prone to multiple vulnerabilities. The following individual issues are reported:

Newsgrab is reported prone to a directory traversal vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because the software does not sufficiently sanitize directory traversal sequences from filenames before the filename is employed to store the file onto disk.

A remote attacker may exploit this vulnerability by supplying a malicious file to a target victim. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CAN-2005-0153.

Newsgrab is reported prone to an unspecified insecure permissions vulnerability.

A local attacker may exploit this vulnerability to disclose potentially sensitive information that is contained in files that were downloaded using newsgrab. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CAN-2005-0154.

A file containing the name '../../../../etc/rc.local' and the mode 777 could cause newsgrab to drop the file at /etc/rc.local with 777 permissions.
