Schmid Watson Management Console is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to view arbitrary files within the context of the affected application. Information harvested may aid in launching further attacks.

Schmid Watson Management Console 4.11.2.G is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
