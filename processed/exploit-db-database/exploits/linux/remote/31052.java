Apache 'mod_negotiation' is prone to an HTML-injection and an HTTP response-splitting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of the affected site, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, control how the site is rendered to the user, and influence or misrepresent how web content is served, cached, or interpreted; other attacks are also possible.
