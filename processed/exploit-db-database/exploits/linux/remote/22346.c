A vulnerability has been discovered in PGP4Pine. The problem occurs when parsing an email message for PGP data. Due to insufficient bounds checking, when processing lines of excessive length, a buffer may be overrun. This would result in sensitive locations in memory being overwritten with data supplied in the message.

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a target system. All instructions executed would be run with the privileges of the users running the software.

This issue affects pgp4pine version 1.76 and earlier.
