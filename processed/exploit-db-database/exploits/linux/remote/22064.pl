It has been reported that Zeroo fails to properly sanitize web requests. By sending a malicious web request to the vulnerable server, using directory traversal sequences, it is possible for a remote attacker to access sensitive resources located outside of the web root.

An attacker is able to traverse outside of the established web root by using dot-dot-slash (../) directory traversal sequences. An attacker may be able to obtain any web server readable files from outside of the web root directory.
