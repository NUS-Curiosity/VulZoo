BlueZ hidd is prone to a device-command-injection vulnerability.

A remote attacker can exploit this issue to gain control of mouse and keyboard HIDs (human interface device). This will allow the attacker to interact with the targeted computer in the context of the currently logged-in user.

Versions prior to 2.25 are vulnerable.
