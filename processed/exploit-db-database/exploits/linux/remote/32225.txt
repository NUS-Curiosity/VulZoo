Vim is prone to a heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

An attacker may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

This issue affects Vim 6.2.429 through 6.3.058.
