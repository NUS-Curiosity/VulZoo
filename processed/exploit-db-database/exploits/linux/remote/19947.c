A buffer overrun exists in the XDMCP handling code used in 'gdm', an xdm replacement, shipped as part of the GNOME desktop. By sending a maliciously crafted XDMCP message, it is possible for a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the susceptible machine. The problem lies in the handling of the display information sent as part of an XDMCP 'FORWARD_QUERY' request.

By default, gdm is not configured to listen via XDMCP. The versions of gdm shipped with RedHat 6.0-6.2, Helix GNOME and gdm built from source are not vulnerable unless they were configured to accept XDMCP requests. This is configured via the /etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf on some systems, although this file may vary. If the "Enable" variable is set to 0, you are not susceptible.
