Firebird SQL is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary machine code in the context of the affected database server. Failed exploit attempts will likely crash the server, denying service to legitimate users.

Firebird SQL 2.0 is vulnerable; previous versions may also be affected.
