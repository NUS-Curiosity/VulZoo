PlanetWeb is a commercially available web server integrated with dynamic DNS services. It is distributed by PlanetDNS, and available for Microsoft Operating Systems.

PlanetWeb does not properly handle long requests. Due to insufficient bounds checking, a long request sent to PlanetWeb may result in a buffer overflow. This could result in a denial of service, and has been reported as being exploitable to execute arbitrary code.
