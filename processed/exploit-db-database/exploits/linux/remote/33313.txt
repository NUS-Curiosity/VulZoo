Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey are prone to a heap-based buffer-overflow vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code and to cause denial-of-service conditions by tricking a victim into visiting a malicious webpage.

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 36843 (Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey MFSA 2009-52 through -64 Multiple Vulnerabilities), but has been assigned its own record to better document it.
