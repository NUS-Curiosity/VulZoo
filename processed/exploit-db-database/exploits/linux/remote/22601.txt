Inktomi Traffic Server is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This is due to insufficient sanitization of input passed to the proxy, which will be echoed back in error pages under some circumstances. A malicious attacker could exploit this issue by creating a link which contains hostile HTML and script code and then enticing users of the proxy to visit the link. When the link is visited via the proxy, attacker-supplied script may be interpreted in the user's browser.

Exploitation could permit HTML and script code to access properties of the domain that is requested through the proxy.
