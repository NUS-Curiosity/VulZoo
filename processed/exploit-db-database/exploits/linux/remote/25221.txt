Mozilla Suite/Firefox and Thunderbird are reported prone to a URI obfuscation weakness. The issue is reported to manifest when 'Save Link As...' functionality is invoked on an malicious anchor tag.

This issue may be leveraged by an attacker to display false information in the status bar of an unsuspecting user, allowing an attacker to present downloads to users that seem to originate from a trusted location. This may facilitate attacks based on this false sense of trust.
