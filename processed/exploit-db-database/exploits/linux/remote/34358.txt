Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey are prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue by tricking an unsuspecting victim into viewing a page containing malicious content. A successful exploit will result in the execution of arbitrary attacker-supplied code in the context of the user running the affected application.

This issue is fixed in:

Firefox 3.6.7
Firefox 3.5.11
SeaMonkey 2.0.6

NOTE: This issue was previously covered in BID 41824 (Mozilla Firefox/Thunderbird/SeaMonkey MFSA 2010-34 Through -47 Multiple Remote Vulnerabilities), but has been assigned its own record to better document it.
