It has been reported that GNU MyProxy may be prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability that may allow a remote attacker to execute HTML or script code in a user's browser. The issue presents itself due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data.

Due to the possibility of attacker-specified HTML and script code being rendered in a victim's browser, it is possible to steal cookie-based authentication credentials from that user. Other attacks are possible as well.

GNU MyProxy version 20030629 has been reported to be affected by this issue, however, it is possible that other versions are vulnerable as well.
