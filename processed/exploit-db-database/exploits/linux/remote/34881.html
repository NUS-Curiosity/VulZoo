Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and Seamonkey are prone to a memory-corruption vulnerability because they fail to adequately validate user-supplied data.

Successful exploits may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running an affected application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

This issue affects versions prior to:

Firefox 3.6.11
Firefox 3.5.14
Thunderbird 3.1.5
Thunderbird 3.0.9
SeaMonkey 2.0.9

NOTE: This issue was previously discussed in 44228 (Mozilla Firefox/Thunderbird/SeaMonkey MFSA 2010-64/65/66/67/68/69/71/72 Multiple Vulnerabilities) but has been given its own record to better document it.
