The file command is affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the application to properly validate string lengths in the affected file prior to copying them into static process buffers.

An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a user that processes the malicious file with the affected utility. This may be leveraged to escalate privileges or to gain unauthorized access.
