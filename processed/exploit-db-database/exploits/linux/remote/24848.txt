ChBg is reported prone to a remote buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue arises because the application fails to carry out proper boundary checks before copying user-supplied data in to sensitive process buffers. It is reported that this issue can allow an attacker to gain superuser privileges on a vulnerable computer.

An attacker can exploit this issue by crafting a malicious scenario file. A scenario is a file containing a list of pictures to display.

If a user obtains this file and processes it through ChBg, the attacker-supplied instructions may be executed on the vulnerable computer.

ChBg 1.5 is reported prone to this vulnerability. It is likely that other versions are affected as well.
