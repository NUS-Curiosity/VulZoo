Many FTP servers are vulnerable to a denial of service condition resulting from poor globbing algorithms and user resource usage limits.

Globbing generates pathnames from file name patterns used by the shell, eg. wildcards denoted by * and ?, multiple choices denoted by {}, etc.

The vulnerable FTP servers can be exploited to exhaust system resources if per-user resource usage controls have not been implemented.
