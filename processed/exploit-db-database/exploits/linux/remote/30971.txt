Georgia SoftWorks Secure Shell Server is prone to multiple remote code-execution vulnerabilities:

- A format-string vulnerability
- Two buffer-overflow vulnerabilities.

Successfully exploiting these issues allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary machine code with SYSTEM-level privileges, facilitating the complete compromise of affected computers.

Georgia SoftWorks Secure Shell Server 7.01.0003 is vulnerable to these issues; other versions may also be affected.
