A vulnerability has been reported for Interchange 4.8.5 and earlier. Reportedly, Interchange may disclose contents of files to attackers.

The vulnerability occurs due to the placement of the 'doc' folder. Reportedly, the folder will be installed as follows: <INTERCHANGE_ROOT>/doc. This folder, by default, contains Interchange man pages. This vulnerability is only exploitable when the Interchange service runs in INET (Internet service) mode.

An attacker may exploit this vulnerability to the contents of restricted files accessible to the Interchange process.

It has been reported that this issue may be exploited through a '../' directory traversal sequence in a HTTP request to the vulnerable server.
