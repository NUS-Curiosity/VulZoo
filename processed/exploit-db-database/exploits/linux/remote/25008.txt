LinPopUp is reported prone to a remote buffer overflow vulnerability. This issue arises because the application fails to carry out proper boundary checks before copying user-supplied data in to sensitive process buffers. It is reported that this issue can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a computer in the context of the application.

An attacker can exploit this issue by crafting a malicious message that contains excessive string data, replacement memory addresses, and executable instructions to trigger this issue.

LinPopUp version 1.2.0 is reported prone to this vulnerability. It is likely that other versions are affected as well.
