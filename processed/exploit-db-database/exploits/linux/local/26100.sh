Lantronix Secure Console Server SCS820/SCS1620 devices are susceptible to multiple local vulnerabilities.

The first issue is an insecure default permission vulnerability. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to write data to arbitrary files with superuser privileges. Other attacks are also possible.

The second issue is a directory traversal vulnerability in the command-line interface. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to gain inappropriate access to the underlying operating system.

The third issue is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the command-line interface. Local users with 'sysadmin' access to the device can escape the command-line interface to gain superuser privileges in the underlying operating system.

The last issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the 'edituser' binary. Attackers may exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary machine code with superuser privileges.

The reporter of these issues states that firmware versions prior to 4.4 are vulnerable.

# The Linux system supplied by Lantronix does not have gnu
