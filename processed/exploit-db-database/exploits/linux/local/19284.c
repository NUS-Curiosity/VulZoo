Armidale Software's Yapp Conferencing System is vulnerable to an environment variable related buffer overflow vulnerability in (at least) the Linux version. The consequence of the vulnerability being exploited is a local root compromise.


/*
 * Exploit for "Yapp Conferencing System, Version 2.2".
 * By Dave Bowman, for Sandra, on January 13 1998.
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * The Yapp Conferencing System client handles environment variables
 * without doing bounds checking, allowing one to overflow a buffer
 * in the "bbs" executable onto the stack. Using this technique, it
 * possible to obtain a shell running as the user which Yapp is setuid
 * to (in some cases, root).
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * bash$ gcc -o yapp_exploit yapp_exploit.c
 * bash$ ./yapp_exploit
 * bash#
 * You'll have to change the definition of "BBS_PROGRAM" in the source.
 * You may also need to alter the offset, but -1000 worked for me.
 *
 * And without further ado...
 *
