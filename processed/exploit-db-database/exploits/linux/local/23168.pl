A vulnerability has been reported in man that may allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges. The problem lies in man failing to carry out sufficient sanity checks before executing a user-defined compression program. As a result, it may be possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary code with user 'man' privileges.

# If it doesnt work, use a different manpage, one that isnt already
# compressed (seldom used).
