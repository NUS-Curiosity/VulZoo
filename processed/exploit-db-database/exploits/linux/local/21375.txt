The Internet Software Consortium (ISC) Internet News (INN) project is a powerful, mature implementation of a usenet system, including a NNTP server and a newsreading server. It is available for a wide range of Unix based systems, including Linux.

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in two components of INN, inews and rnews. Reportedly, both are vulnerable to locally exploitable format string problems. Under some systems these binaries may be installed suid root or sgid news, allowing a local attacker to gain elevated privileges.
