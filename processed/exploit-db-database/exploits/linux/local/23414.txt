It has been reported that FVWM may be prone to a command execution vulnerability that may allow an attacker to execute malicious commands on a vulnerable system. It has been reported that the fvwm-menu-directory component does not properly sanitize user input and allows a user with write permissions to a directory to execute arbitrary commands.

FVWM versions 2.14.17 and 2.5.8 have been reported to be vulnerable to this issue, however other versions may be affected as well.
