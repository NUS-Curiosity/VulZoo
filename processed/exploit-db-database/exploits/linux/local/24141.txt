cPanel is reported prone to a privilege escalation vulnerability. It is reported that the options used by cPanel to compile Apache 1.3.29 and PHP using the mod_phpsuexec option are insecure. These settings will reportedly permit a local attacker to execute arbitrary code as any user who possesses a PHP file that is published to the Apache web server.

PATH_TRANSLATED=/gone.php
SCRIPT_FILENAME=/usr/local/cpanel/base/frontend/default/phpinfo.php
/usr/bin/php
If the above results in a "No input file specified." message then the system is vulnerable.
