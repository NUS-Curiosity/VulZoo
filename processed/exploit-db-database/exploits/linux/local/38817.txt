Poppler is prone to a local format-string vulnerability because it fails to sanitize user-supplied input.

An attacker may exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable application. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in a denial-of-service condition.

Versions prior to Poppler 0.24.3 are vulnerable.
