Chinput is an input server designed for Chinese characters. It is available on Linux and other Unix based systems. Chinput appears to be installed suid root by default.

A vulnerability exists in Chinput. A local user with an extremely long HOME environment variable may cause a buffer to overflow. If successfully exploited, this can overwrite the instruction pointer, and lead to the execution of arbitrary code as root.

/* local exploit for Chinput 3.0
 * .. tested in TurboLinux 6.5 with kernel 2.2.18
 *
 * Usage: $gcc chinput_exp.c
 *        $./a.out
 *        bash-2.04$ /usr/bin/chinput
