A vulnerability exists in the installation of Multisoft's FlagShip 4.4 product. Some binaries are installed with world writable permissions. This may allow an attacker to alter a binary and cause other users to execute arbitrary code.

The files:
/usr/bin/FSserial
/usr/bin/FlagShip_c
/usr/bin/FlagShip_p

are world writable.
