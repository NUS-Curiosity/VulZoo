liloconfig-color creates the file /tmp/reply insecurely and follows symbolic links. An attacker can create a symbolic link from /tmp/reply to any file and wait for root to run the program. This will clober the target file.
The file created has permissions -rw-r--r--.

$ ln -s /tmp/reply /etc/passwd
< wait for root to run liloconfig-color >
