Vendor description:
-------------------
"GParted is a free partition editor for graphically managing your disk
partitions.

With GParted you can resize, copy, and move partitions without data
loss, enabling you to:
* Grow or shrink your C: drive
* Create space for new operating systems
* Attempt data rescue from lost partitions"

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Gparted <=0.14.1 does not properly sanitize strings before passing
them as parameters to an OS command. Those commands are executed
using root privileges.

Parameters that are being used for OS commands in Gparted are normally
determined by the user (e.g. disk labels, mount points).  However, under
certain circumstances, an attacker can use an external storage device to
inject command parameters. These circumstances are met if for example an
automounter uses a filesystem label as part of the mount path.

Please note that GParted versions before 0.15 are still being used
in distributions. E.g Debian Wheezy is vulnerable to this issue before
applying the patches.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
The following command creates a malicious filesystem.

# mkfs.ext2 -L "\`reboot\`" /dev/sdXX

When this filesystem is mounted by an automounter to a mountpoint
containing the filesystem label and the user tries to unmount this filesystem
using GParted, the system reboots.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
Gparted versions <=0.14.1 were found to be vulnerable.
