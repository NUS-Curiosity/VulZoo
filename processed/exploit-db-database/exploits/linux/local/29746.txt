Horde Framework and IMP are prone to a vulnerability that allows a local attacker to delete arbitrary files in the context of the user running the application.

A successful attack can reduce the integrity of affected computers and may aid in further attacks.

An attacker could exploit this issue by creating a file '/tmp/x /etc/passwd /tmpmswordx' and running the affected cron script. This will result in the deletion of '/tmp/x', '/etc/passwd', and '/tmp/mswordx'.
