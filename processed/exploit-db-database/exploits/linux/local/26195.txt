QNX RTOS is susceptible to a local arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure of the 'inputtrap' utility to properly implement access control restrictions.

This vulnerability allows local malicious users to gain access to the contents of arbitrary files with superuser privileges, aiding them in further attacks.

QNX RTOS versions 6.1 and 6.3 are affected by this issue. Other versions are also likely affected. This issue is similar to the one described in BID 4901.
