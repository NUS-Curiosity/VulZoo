ELinks is prone to an arbitrary code-execution vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected application.

This issue requires an attacker to trick an unsuspecting victim into running the vulnerable application in an attacker-controlled directory.

This issue affects ELinks 0.11.1; other versions may also be vulnerable.
