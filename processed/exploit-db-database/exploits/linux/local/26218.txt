Frox is prone to a vulnerability that permits read access to arbitrary files.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability will grant the attacker read access to arbitrary files on the system in the security context of the Frox process. Information obtained may aid in further attacks against the underlying system; other attacks are also possible.

It should be noted that this issue is only exploitable if Frox is installed with setuid or setgid privileges.
