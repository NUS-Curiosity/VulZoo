The root user is disabled on Red Star, and it doesn't look like there is a way to enable it.
UnFortunately, they left a big security hole: the Software Manager (swmng.app),
which runs as root through sudo and will install any RPM package, even if unsigned.

To get root, get this RPM package I made into Red Star through an ISO (if you're using a virtual machine) or USB key,
double-click it to open it with the Software Manager, and click through the blue buttons until itâ€™s done.
After that, run rootsh to get a root shell.
Being a RedHat-based system (hinting on Fedora 15), SELinux will prevent you from doing some things,
but disabling it is a matter of running setenforce 0 as root.
