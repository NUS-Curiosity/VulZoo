A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the implementation of the 'man' system manual pager program commonly included with Linux distributions.

The vulnerability exists due to the way the program handles manual page files beginning with a '.so' statement. Under certain circumstances, the code responsible for processing this data may be allow the length of the filename from a '.so' statement to be expanded, eventually causing a boundary condition error.

As a result, it may be possible for local users to execute arbitrary code with group 'man' privileges.
