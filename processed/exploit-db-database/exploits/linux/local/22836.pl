A buffer overrun has been discovered in Elm. The problem occurs due to insufficient bounds checking performed before copying user-supplied data into an internal memory buffer. Specifically, a TERM environment variable containing excessive data would cause a buffer within Elm to be overrun.

As Elm is installed setgid on some systems, the exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially allow for the elevation of local privileges.
