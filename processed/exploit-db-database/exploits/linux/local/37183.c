/* PonyOS <= 3.0 tty ioctl() root exploit
  ========================================
  PonyOS 0.4.99-mlp had two kernel vulnerabilities
  disclosed in April 2013 that could be leveraged
  to read/write arbitrary kernel memory. This is
  due to tty winsize ioctl() allowing to read/write
  arbitrary memory. This exploit patches the setuid
  system call to remove a root uid check allowing
  any process to obtain root privileges.

  John Cartwright found these flaws and others here:
