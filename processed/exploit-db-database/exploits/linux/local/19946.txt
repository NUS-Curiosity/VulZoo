A vulnerability exists in OpenLDAP as shipped with some versions of Linux, including RedHat 6.1 and 6.2, and TurboLinux 6.0.2 and earlier. OpenLDAP will create files in /usr/tmp, which is actually a symbolic link to the world writable /tmp directory. As OpenLDAP does not check for a files existence prior to opening the files in /usr/tmp, it is possible for an attacker to point an appropriately named symbolic link at any file on the filesystem, and cause it to be destroyed.

This vulnerability will also affect any Unix system with OpenLDAP assuming the following criteria is true:
1) slapd.conf configures the "directory" variable to be /usr/tmp
2) /usr/tmp is a world writable directory.
3) slurpd was built with the DEFAULT_SLURPD_REPLICA_DIR set to /usr/tmp

ln -sf /etc/passwd /usr/tmp/NEXTID
