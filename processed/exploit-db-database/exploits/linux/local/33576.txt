Battery Life Toolkit (BLTK) is prone to a local privilege-escalation vulnerability.

A local attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code with superuser privileges, resulting in the complete compromise of the affected computer.

This issue affects BLTK 1.0.9; other versions may be vulnerable as well.

The following proof of concept is available:

/usr/lib/bltk/bin/bltk_sudo /bin/bash
