The Linux Kernel is prone to an information-disclosure vulnerability because it fails to properly initialize certain memory before using using it in a user-accessible operation.

Successful exploits will allow attackers to view portions of kernel memory. Information harvested may be used in further attacks.

Versions prior to Linux Kernel 2.6.28.8 are vulnerable.
