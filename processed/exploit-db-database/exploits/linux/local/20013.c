A buffer overflow condition that could be exploited to obtain root exists in splitvt 1.6.3 and earlier. Splitvt is distributed with several Linux distributions.

/*
	Local exploit for Debian splitvt 1.6.3-4 - by Syzop

	Thanks to aleph1 for writing the article about
	buffer overflows in phrack 49 :).

	Greetz:	Terror, Scorpion, ^Stealth^, Jornx, Multani,
		and all other ppl of The^Alliance :)

How to use the exploit
-----------------------

1.	Use: ./splitexp >expcode to put the exploitcode into 'expcode'.
2.	Start splitvt
3.	Enter something like 'sleep 60; echo lalala'
4.	Ctrl+O, x, 'Enter password' bla
5.	Then splitvt says 'Re-enter password', this is the moment
	you have to follow the instructions in 'expcode' to paste
	the exploitcode to splitvt (don't press enter, see 6).
6.	Wait until the sleep is done (or kill 'sleep' yourself from
	_another_ terminal).
7.	You now got a rootshell,
	type 'reset' to get a normal terminal :).

IMPORTANT NOTES!!
------------------

NOTE 1:	You have to paste the data exactly, so just a paste with the mouse
	won't work since the shellcode also contains 08's (backspaces),
	So using mouse copy&paste in normal linux console mode doesn't work,
	I used windows with 'putty'

NOTE 2: If you ftp the exploit code to a windows box, be sure to transfer
	the file in ASCII mode :).
