GNU Bash is prone to a command-injection vulnerability because it fails to adequately sanitize control characters in the 'ls' command.

Attackers can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands in a bash terminal; other attacks may also be possible.

The following example is available:

1. mkdir $(echo -e 'couc\x08\x08asd')
2. ls

Displays:
coasd/

Expected:
couc??asd/
