Vixie cron is an implementation of the popular UNIX program that runs user-specified programs at periodic scheduled times.

When a parsing error occurs after a modification operation, crontab will fail to drop privileges correctly for subsequent modification operations.

This vulnerability may be exploited to gain root privileges locally.

#!/bin/sh
#
# cronboom - simple proof-of-concept exploit for vixie cron version 3.1pl1
#
# synopsis:
#   the crontab file maintenance program (crontab) fails to drop privileges
#   before invoking the editor under certain circumstances.
#
# description:
#   a serialization error exists in some versions of the file maintenance
#   program, crontab.  the vulnerability was introduced in versions which
#   were patched for seperate vulnerability in fall of 2000 (see Bugtraq
#   ID #1960).
#
#   when a parsing error occurs after a modification operation, crontab will
#   fail to drop privileges correctly for subsequent modification operations.
#   because the program is installed setuid root, it may be possible for a
#   local user to gain root privileges.
#
# affected versions:
#   cron_3.0pl1-57.2 distributed with Debian Linux 2.2.
#
#   note that copies of the program with the patch mentioned above are likely
#   to also be vulnerable.
