A vulnerability has been discovered in QNX Real-Time Operating System. It has been reported that an unauthorized user may access arbitrary files. This is possible by requesting the file through the location that the FAT partition is mounted to. Accessing files in this manner ignores all permissions set by the operating system.

example: cat /fs-dos/linux/etc/shadow
