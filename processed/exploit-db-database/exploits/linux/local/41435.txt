1. Description.
   /usr/bin/shutter in Shutter through 0.93.1 allows user-assisted remote
attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted image name that is
mishandled during a "Run a plugin" action.

2. Proof of concept.
   1) Rename an image to something like "$(firefox)"
   2) Open the renamed file in shutter
   3) Click the "Run a plugin" option and select any plugin from the list and click "Run"
