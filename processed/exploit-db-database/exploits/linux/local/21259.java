Java programs run in an intepreted environment, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Sun has provided a reference JVM implementation for multiple platforms, including Solaris, Windows and Linux.

It is possible for a maliciously constructed, valid java program to crash the Sun JVM. This may result in a denial of service attack in a shared environment. The ability to consistantly exploit this vulnerability has been demonstrated on the Linux version of the Sun JVM.

    public static void main(String[] args)

        java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged
        ((java.security.PrivilegedAction)null);
    }
}
