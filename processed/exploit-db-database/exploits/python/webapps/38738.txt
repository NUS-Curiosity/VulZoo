Plone is prone to a session-hijacking vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to hijack user sessions and gain unauthorized access to the affected application.

Note: This issue was previously discussed in the BID 61544 (Plone Multiple Remote Security Vulnerabilities), but has been moved to its own record to better document it.
