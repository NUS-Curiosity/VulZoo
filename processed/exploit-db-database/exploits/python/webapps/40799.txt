2. Overview

Mezzanine is an open source CMS written in python. In version 4.2.0, it is
vulnerable to two persistent XSS attacks, one of which requires extended
privileges, the other one does not. These issues allow an attacker to steal
cookies, inject JavaScript keyloggers, or bypass CSRF protection.

3. Details

XSS 1: Persistent XSS via Name in Comments

CVSS: Medium 5.0 AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

Description: When leaving a comment on a blog post, the author name is echoed
unencoded in the backend, leading to persistent XSS.

Proof of Concept:

Leave a comment, as author name use '"><img src=no onerror=alert(1)> To trigger
the payload, view the comment overview in the admin backend: http://
localhost:8000/admin/generic/threadedcomment

XSS 2: Persistent XSS via HTML file upload

CVSS: Medium 4.0 AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N

Description: When uploading files via the media manager, the extension .html is
allowed, leading to XSS via file upload. An account with the permissions to
upload files to the media manager is required.

Proof of Concept:

Visit the media manager and upload a .html file: http://localhost:8000/admin/
media-library/upload/?ot=desc&o=date As uploaded files are stored inside the
web root, it can now be accessed, thus executing the JavaScript code it
contains: http://localhost:8000/static/media/uploads/xss.html

4. Solution

To mitigate this issue please upgrade at least to version 4.2.1:

https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/releases/tag/4.2.1
