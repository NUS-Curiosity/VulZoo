FreeBSD is prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability because the kernel fails to require superuser privileges to perform a sensitive operation.

An attacker may leverage this issue to consume all CPU resources, denying service to legitimate users.

FreeBSD versions 5.5-RELEASE through 6.0-RELEASE-p10 are vulnerable to this issue; previous versions may also be affected.

   Log: Don't allow non-root user to set a scheduler policy, otherwise this could be a local DOS.
   lol lol, thatz true. kokanin@gmail lolling it out in '06 !"#%&%(20061013)(="#"!
   tested on FreeBSD 5.5-RELEASE, 6.0-RELEASE-p5, 6.1-RELEASE, 6.1-RELEASE-p10 (latest at the time of writing)
   wow, that sort of makes this 0day local freebsd denial of service for non-CURRENT or whatever.
   usage: ./run me and wait a moment.. woo, it's friday the 13th, go crash some shell providers.
