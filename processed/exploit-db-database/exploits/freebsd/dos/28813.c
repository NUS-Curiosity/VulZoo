FreeBSD is prone to a local denial-of-service vulnerability because it fails to handle exceptional conditions.

An attacker may leverage this issue to crash the affected computer, denying service to legitimate users. Under certain conditions, successful exploits may also corrupt the filesystem.

FreeBSD version 6.0-RELEASE-p5 and 6.1-RELEASE-p10 are vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.

/* FreeBSD cvs commit: src/sys/ufs/ufs/ufs_vnops.c maxim 2006-05-31 13:15:29 UTC
   Log: According to POSIX, the result of ftruncate(2) is unspecified
   for file types other than VREG, VDIR and shared memory objects.
   We already handle VREG, VLNK and VDIR cases.  Silently ignore
   truncate requests for all the rest. PR kern/98064

   lol lol, thatz true. kokanin@gmail lolling it out in '06 !"#%&%(20061013)(="#"!
   tested on FreeBSD 6.0-RELEASE-p5, 6.1-RELEASE-p10 (latest at the time of writing)
   - it just makes the system reboot, and with a bit of luck fucks up the filesystem.
   wow, that sort of makes this 0day local freebsd denial of service for non-CURRENT or whatever.
   usage: ./run me and wait a moment.. woo, it's friday the 13th, go crash some shell providers.
