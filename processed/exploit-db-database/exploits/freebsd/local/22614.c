Maelstrom for Linux has been reported prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The issue is reportedly due to a lack of sufficient bounds checking performed on user-supplied data before it is copied into an internal memory space. It may be possible for a local attacker to exploit this condition and have malicious arbitrary code executed in the context of the Maelstrom application. Typically setGID games.

/*  /usr/bin/Maelstrom local exploit
*** Sorry for my poor english.
*** Others exploit can't exploit my Maelstrom,So I
wrote this exploit just for fun.
*** I can't get a rootshell on my linux ,because it's
not SUID.
*** If it SUID ,this exploit can make you get a rootshell.
*** Tested on redhat9.0 ,other linux maybe OK,too.
***
*** Thanks netric's good paper.
*** You can downlocd it here
http://www.netric.org/papers/envpaper.pdf
*** This paper make me write this exploit don't need to
guess ret.
*** Thanks jsk and axis for their help.
