Maelstrom for Linux has been reported prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability.

The issue is reportedly due to a lack of sufficient bounds checking performed on user-supplied data before it is copied into an internal memory space. It may be possible for a local attacker to exploit this condition and have malicious arbitrary code executed in the context of the Maelstrom application. Typically setGID games.
