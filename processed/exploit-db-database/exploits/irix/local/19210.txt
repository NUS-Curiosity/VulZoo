The setuid root "midikeys" executable can be used to edit arbitrary files via its graphical user interface. This grants malicious users root access to the system.

Running the midikeys application, clicking in sounds, and then songs will bring up a file dialog. By entering a filename of a known file it will be opened for editing with root privileges.

The packge that midikeys is part of is dmedia_eoe.sw.synth.

People have reported trouble reproducting the vulnerability when the editor is vi. Please try again using some other editor such as gvim or emacs. Alternatively you can change the WINEDITOR environment variable to be any command you want executed as root(e.g. "/bin/chmod 4755 /tmp/sh").

You can change it under Irix 6.2 by going to Toolchest -> Desktop -> Customize -> Desktop -> Default Editor: Other, or under Irix 6.5 in Toolchest -> Desktop -> Customize -> Utilities -> Test Editor: Other.

devel 26% ./midikeys -display remotehost:0

devel 27% Xlib: extension "GLX" missing on display remotehost:0.0". Xlib: extension "GLX" missing on display "remotehost:0.0".

under the midikeys window click sounds and then midi songs. This will open a file manager type interface.

You can enter the path and filename of files you which to read, including root owned with group/world read/write permissions unset.

If you select a file like "/usr/share/data/music/README" it will appear in a text editor. Use the text editor to open /etc/passwd and make modifications at will. Save and enjoy.
