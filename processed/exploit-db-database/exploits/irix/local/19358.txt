The xfsdump program shipped with Irix 5.x and 6.x from SGI contains a vulnerability which could lead to root compromise. By creating a log file in /usr/tmp called bck.log, a user could create a symbolic link from this file to any file they wish to be created as root. This is turn could be used to compromise the system.

ln -sf /.rhosts /usr/tmp/bck.log
