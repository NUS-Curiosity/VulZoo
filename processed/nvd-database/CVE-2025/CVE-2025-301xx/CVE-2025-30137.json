The GNET mobile application contains hardcoded credentials that provide unauthorized access to the dashcam's API endpoints on ports 9091 and 9092. Once the GNET SSID is connected to, the attacker sends a crafted authentication command with TibetList and 000000 to list settings of the dashcam at port 9091. There's a separate set of credentials for port 9092 (stream) that is also exposed in cleartext: admin + tibet. For settings, the required credentials are adim + 000000."
