      "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Allow delete from sockmap/sockhash only if update is allowed\n\nWe have seen an influx of syzkaller reports where a BPF program attached to\na tracepoint triggers a locking rule violation by performing a map_delete\non a sockmap/sockhash.\n\nWe don't intend to support this artificial use scenario. Extend the\nexisting verifier allowed-program-type check for updating sockmap/sockhash\nto also cover deleting from a map.\n\nFrom now on only BPF programs which were previously allowed to update\nsockmap/sockhash can delete from these map types."
