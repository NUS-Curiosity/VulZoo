Subject: CVE-2021-47017: ath10k: Fix a use after free in ath10k_htc_send_bundle

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ath10k: Fix a use after free in ath10k_htc_send_bundle

In ath10k_htc_send_bundle, the bundle_skb could be freed by
dev_kfree_skb_any(bundle_skb). But the bundle_skb is used later
by bundle_skb->len.

As skb_len = bundle_skb->len, my patch replaces bundle_skb->len to
skb_len after the bundle_skb was freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47017 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
