Subject: CVE-2021-47255: kvm: LAPIC: Restore guard to prevent illegal APIC register access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kvm: LAPIC: Restore guard to prevent illegal APIC register access

Per the SDM, "any access that touches bytes 4 through 15 of an APIC
register may cause undefined behavior and must not be executed."
Worse, such an access in kvm_lapic_reg_read can result in a leak of
kernel stack contents. Prior to commit 01402cf81051 ("kvm: LAPIC:
write down valid APIC registers"), such an access was explicitly
disallowed. Restore the guard that was removed in that commit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47255 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
