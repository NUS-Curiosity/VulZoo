Subject: CVE-2021-47520: can: pch_can: pch_can_rx_normal: fix use after free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: pch_can: pch_can_rx_normal: fix use after free

After calling netif_receive_skb(skb), dereferencing skb is unsafe.
Especially, the can_frame cf which aliases skb memory is dereferenced
just after the call netif_receive_skb(skb).

Reordering the lines solves the issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47520 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
