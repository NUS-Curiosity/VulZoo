Subject: CVE-2021-47266: RDMA/ipoib: Fix warning caused by destroying non-initial netns

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/ipoib: Fix warning caused by destroying non-initial netns

After the commit 5ce2dced8e95 ("RDMA/ipoib: Set rtnl_link_ops for ipoib
interfaces"), if the IPoIB device is moved to non-initial netns,
destroying that netns lets the device vanish instead of moving it back to
the initial netns, This is happening because default_device_exit() skips
the interfaces due to having rtnl_link_ops set.

Steps to reporoduce:
  ip netns add foo
  ip link set mlx5_ib0 netns foo
  ip netns delete foo

To avoid the above warning and later on the kernel panic that could happen
on shutdown due to a NULL pointer dereference, make sure to set the
netns_refund flag that was introduced by commit 3a5ca857079e ("can: dev:
Move device back to init netns on owning netns delete") to properly
restore the IPoIB interfaces to the initial netns.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47266 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
