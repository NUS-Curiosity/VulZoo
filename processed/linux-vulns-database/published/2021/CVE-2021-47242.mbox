Subject: CVE-2021-47242: mptcp: fix soft lookup in subflow_error_report()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix soft lookup in subflow_error_report()

Maxim reported a soft lookup in subflow_error_report():

The calling function - mptcp_subflow_data_available() - can be invoked
from different contexts:
- plain ssk socket lock
- ssk socket lock + mptcp_data_lock
- ssk socket lock + mptcp_data_lock + msk socket lock.

Since subflow_error_report() tries to acquire the mptcp_data_lock, the
latter two call chains will cause soft lookup.

This change addresses the issue moving the error reporting call to
outer functions, where the held locks list is known and the we can
acquire only the needed one.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47242 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/mptcp/protocol.c
	net/mptcp/subflow.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/27ef25c72373222aaa5fe7b5cd890ae9cfb89a8d
