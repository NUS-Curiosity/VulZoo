Subject: CVE-2021-47195: spi: fix use-after-free of the add_lock mutex

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: fix use-after-free of the add_lock mutex

Commit 6098475d4cb4 ("spi: Fix deadlock when adding SPI controllers on
SPI buses") introduced a per-controller mutex. But mutex_unlock() of
said lock is called after the controller is already freed:

  spi_unregister_controller(ctlr)
  -> put_device(&ctlr->dev)
    -> spi_controller_release(dev)
  -> mutex_unlock(&ctrl->add_lock)

Move the put_device() after the mutex_unlock().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47195 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
