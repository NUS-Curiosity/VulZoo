Subject: CVE-2021-47150: net: fec: fix the potential memory leak in fec_enet_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fec: fix the potential memory leak in fec_enet_init()

If the memory allocated for cbd_base is failed, it should
free the memory allocated for the queues, otherwise it causes
memory leak.

And if the memory allocated for the queues is failed, it can
return error directly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47150 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
