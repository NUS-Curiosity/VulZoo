Subject: CVE-2021-47455: ptp: Fix possible memory leak in ptp_clock_register()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ptp: Fix possible memory leak in ptp_clock_register()

I got memory leak as follows when doing fault injection test:

unreferenced object 0xffff88800906c618 (size 8):
  comm "i2c-idt82p33931", pid 4421, jiffies 4294948083 (age 13.188s)
  hex dump (first 8 bytes):
    70 74 70 30 00 00 00 00                          ptp0....
  backtrace:
    [<00000000312ed458>] __kmalloc_track_caller+0x19f/0x3a0
    [<0000000079f6e2ff>] kvasprintf+0xb5/0x150
    [<0000000026aae54f>] kvasprintf_const+0x60/0x190
    [<00000000f323a5f7>] kobject_set_name_vargs+0x56/0x150
    [<000000004e35abdd>] dev_set_name+0xc0/0x100
    [<00000000f20cfe25>] ptp_clock_register+0x9f4/0xd30 [ptp]
    [<000000008bb9f0de>] idt82p33_probe.cold+0x8b6/0x1561 [ptp_idt82p33]

When posix_clock_register() returns an error, the name allocated
in dev_set_name() will be leaked, the put_device() should be used
to give up the device reference, then the name will be freed in
kobject_cleanup() and other memory will be freed in ptp_clock_release().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47455 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/95c0a0c5ec8839f8f21672be786e87a100319ca8
