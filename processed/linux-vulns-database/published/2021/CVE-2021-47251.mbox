Subject: CVE-2021-47251: mac80211: fix skb length check in ieee80211_scan_rx()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mac80211: fix skb length check in ieee80211_scan_rx()

Replace hard-coded compile-time constants for header length check
with dynamic determination based on the frame type. Otherwise, we
hit a validation WARN_ON in cfg80211 later.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
