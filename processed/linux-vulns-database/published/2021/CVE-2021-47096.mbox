Subject: CVE-2021-47096: ALSA: rawmidi - fix the uninitalized user_pversion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: rawmidi - fix the uninitalized user_pversion

The user_pversion was uninitialized for the user space file structure
in the open function, because the file private structure use
kmalloc for the allocation.

The kernel ALSA sequencer code clears the file structure, so no additional
fixes are required.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
