Subject: CVE-2021-47499: iio: accel: kxcjk-1013: Fix possible memory leak in probe and remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: accel: kxcjk-1013: Fix possible memory leak in probe and remove

When ACPI type is ACPI_SMO8500, the data->dready_trig will not be set, the
memory allocated by iio_triggered_buffer_setup() will not be freed, and cause
memory leak as follows:

unreferenced object 0xffff888009551400 (size 512):
  comm "i2c-SMO8500-125", pid 911, jiffies 4294911787 (age 83.852s)
  hex dump (first 32 bytes):

    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 20 e2 e5 c0 ff ff ff ff  ........ .......
  backtrace:
    [<0000000041ce75ee>] kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x16d/0x360
    [<000000000aeb17b0>] iio_kfifo_allocate+0x41/0x130 [kfifo_buf]

    [<000000004375b15f>] kxcjk1013_probe+0x10c3/0x1d81 [kxcjk_1013]

Fix it by remove data->dready_trig condition in probe and remove.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47499 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
