Subject: CVE-2021-47339: media: v4l2-core: explicitly clear ioctl input data

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: v4l2-core: explicitly clear ioctl input data

As seen from a recent syzbot bug report, mistakes in the compat ioctl
implementation can lead to uninitialized kernel stack data getting used
as input for driver ioctl handlers.

The reported bug is now fixed, but it's possible that other related
bugs are still present or get added in the future. As the drivers need
to check user input already, the possible impact is fairly low, but it
might still cause an information leak.

To be on the safe side, always clear the entire ioctl buffer before
calling the conversion handler functions that are meant to initialize
them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47339 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
