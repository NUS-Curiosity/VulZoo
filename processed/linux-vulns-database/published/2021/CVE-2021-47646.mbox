Subject: CVE-2021-47646: Revert "Revert "block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges""

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "Revert "block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges""

A crash [1] happened to be triggered in conjunction with commit
2d52c58b9c9b ("block, bfq: honor already-setup queue merges"). The
latter was then reverted by commit ebc69e897e17 ("Revert "block, bfq:
honor already-setup queue merges""). Yet, the reverted commit was not
the one introducing the bug. In fact, it actually triggered a UAF
introduced by a different commit, and now fixed by commit d29bd41428cf
("block, bfq: reset last_bfqq_created on group change").

So, there is no point in keeping commit 2d52c58b9c9b ("block, bfq:
honor already-setup queue merges") out. This commit restores it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
