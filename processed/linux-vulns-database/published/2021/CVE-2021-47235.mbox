Subject: CVE-2021-47235: net: ethernet: fix potential use-after-free in ec_bhf_remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: fix potential use-after-free in ec_bhf_remove

static void ec_bhf_remove(struct pci_dev *dev)
{
...
	struct ec_bhf_priv *priv = netdev_priv(net_dev);

	unregister_netdev(net_dev);
	free_netdev(net_dev);

	pci_iounmap(dev, priv->dma_io);
	pci_iounmap(dev, priv->io);
...
}

priv is netdev private data, but it is used
after free_netdev(). It can cause use-after-free when accessing priv
pointer. So, fix it by moving free_netdev() after pci_iounmap()
calls.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47235 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
