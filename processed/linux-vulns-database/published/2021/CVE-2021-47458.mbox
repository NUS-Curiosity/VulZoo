Subject: CVE-2021-47458: ocfs2: mount fails with buffer overflow in strlen

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: mount fails with buffer overflow in strlen

Starting with kernel 5.11 built with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE mouting an
ocfs2 filesystem with either o2cb or pcmk cluster stack fails with the
trace below.  Problem seems to be that strings for cluster stack and
cluster name are not guaranteed to be null terminated in the disk
representation, while strlcpy assumes that the source string is always
null terminated.  This causes a read outside of the source string
triggering the buffer overflow detection.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
