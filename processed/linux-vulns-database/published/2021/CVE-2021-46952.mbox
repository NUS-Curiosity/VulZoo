Subject: CVE-2021-46952: NFS: fs_context: validate UDP retrans to prevent shift out-of-bounds

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: fs_context: validate UDP retrans to prevent shift out-of-bounds

Fix shift out-of-bounds in xprt_calc_majortimeo(). This is caused
by a garbage timeout (retrans) mount option being passed to nfs mount,
in this case from syzkaller.

If the protocol is XPRT_TRANSPORT_UDP, then 'retrans' is a shift
value for a 64-bit long integer, so 'retrans' cannot be >= 64.
If it is >= 64, fail the mount and return an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46952 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
