Subject: CVE-2021-47559: net/smc: Fix NULL pointer dereferencing in smc_vlan_by_tcpsk()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: Fix NULL pointer dereferencing in smc_vlan_by_tcpsk()

Coverity reports a possible NULL dereferencing problem:

in smc_vlan_by_tcpsk():
6. returned_null: netdev_lower_get_next returns NULL (checked 29 out of 30 times).
7. var_assigned: Assigning: ndev = NULL return value from netdev_lower_get_next.
1623                ndev = (struct net_device *)netdev_lower_get_next(ndev, &lower);
CID 1468509 (#1 of 1): Dereference null return value (NULL_RETURNS)
8. dereference: Dereferencing a pointer that might be NULL ndev when calling is_vlan_dev.
1624                if (is_vlan_dev(ndev)) {

Remove the manual implementation and use netdev_walk_all_lower_dev() to
iterate over the lower devices. While on it remove an obsolete function
parameter comment.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47559 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
