Subject: CVE-2021-47301: igb: Fix use-after-free error during reset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igb: Fix use-after-free error during reset

Cleans the next descriptor to watch (next_to_watch) when cleaning the
TX ring.

Failure to do so can cause invalid memory accesses. If igb_poll() runs
while the controller is reset this can lead to the driver try to free
a skb that was already freed.

(The crash is harder to reproduce with the igb driver, but the same
potential problem exists as the code is identical to igc)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47301 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
