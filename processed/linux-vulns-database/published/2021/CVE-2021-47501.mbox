Subject: CVE-2021-47501: i40e: Fix NULL pointer dereference in i40e_dbg_dump_desc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: Fix NULL pointer dereference in i40e_dbg_dump_desc

When trying to dump VFs VSI RX/TX descriptors
using debugfs there was a crash
due to NULL pointer dereference in i40e_dbg_dump_desc.
Added a check to i40e_dbg_dump_desc that checks if
VSI type is correct for dumping RX/TX descriptors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47501 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
