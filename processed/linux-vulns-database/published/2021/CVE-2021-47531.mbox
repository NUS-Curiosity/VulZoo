Subject: CVE-2021-47531: drm/msm: Fix mmap to include VM_IO and VM_DONTDUMP

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: Fix mmap to include VM_IO and VM_DONTDUMP

In commit 510410bfc034 ("drm/msm: Implement mmap as GEM object
function") we switched to a new/cleaner method of doing things. That's
good, but we missed a little bit.

Before that commit, we used to _first_ run through the
drm_gem_mmap_obj() case where `obj->funcs->mmap()` was NULL. That meant
that we ran:

  vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP | VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP;
  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_writecombine(vm_get_page_prot(vma->vm_flags));
  vma->vm_page_prot = pgprot_decrypted(vma->vm_page_prot);

...and _then_ we modified those mappings with our own. Now that
`obj->funcs->mmap()` is no longer NULL we don't run the default
code. It looks like the fact that the vm_flags got VM_IO / VM_DONTDUMP
was important because we're now getting crashes on Chromebooks that
use ARC++ while logging out. Specifically a crash that looks like this
(this is on a 5.10 kernel w/ relevant backports but also seen on a
5.15 kernel):

Let's add the two flags back in.

While we're at it, the fact that we aren't running the default means
that we _don't_ need to clear out VM_PFNMAP, so remove that and save
an instruction.

NOTE: it was confirmed that VM_IO was the important flag to fix the
problem I was seeing, but adding back VM_DONTDUMP seems like a sane
thing to do so I'm doing that too.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47531 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8e2b7fe5e8a4be5e571561d9afcfbd92097288ba
