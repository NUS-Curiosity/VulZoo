Subject: CVE-2021-47090: mm/hwpoison: clear MF_COUNT_INCREASED before retrying get_any_page()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hwpoison: clear MF_COUNT_INCREASED before retrying get_any_page()

Hulk Robot reported a panic in put_page_testzero() when testing
madvise() with MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE.  The BUG() is triggered when retrying
get_any_page().  This is because we keep MF_COUNT_INCREASED flag in
second try but the refcnt is not increased.

    page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) == 0)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
