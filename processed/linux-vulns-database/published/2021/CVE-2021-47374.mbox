Subject: CVE-2021-47374: dma-debug: prevent an error message from causing runtime problems

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dma-debug: prevent an error message from causing runtime problems

For some drivers, that use the DMA API. This error message can be reached
several millions of times per second, causing spam to the kernel's printk
buffer and bringing the CPU usage up to 100% (so, it should be rate
limited). However, since there is at least one driver that is in the
mainline and suffers from the error condition, it is more useful to
err_printk() here instead of just rate limiting the error message (in hopes
that it will make it easier for other drivers that suffer from this issue
to be spotted).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47374 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.14.9 with commit de4afec2d2946c92c62a15ab341c70b287289e6a
	Fixed in 5.15 with commit 510e1a724ab1bf38150be2c1acabb303f98d0047

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2021-47374
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	kernel/dma/debug.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/de4afec2d2946c92c62a15ab341c70b287289e6a
