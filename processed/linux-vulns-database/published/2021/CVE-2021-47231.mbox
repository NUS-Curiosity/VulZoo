Subject: CVE-2021-47231: can: mcba_usb: fix memory leak in mcba_usb

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: mcba_usb: fix memory leak in mcba_usb

Syzbot reported memory leak in SocketCAN driver for Microchip CAN BUS
Analyzer Tool. The problem was in unfreed usb_coherent.

In mcba_usb_start() 20 coherent buffers are allocated and there is
nothing, that frees them:

1) In callback function the urb is resubmitted and that's all
2) In disconnect function urbs are simply killed, but URB_FREE_BUFFER
   is not set (see mcba_usb_start) and this flag cannot be used with
   coherent buffers.

Fail log:
| [ 1354.053291][ T8413] mcba_usb 1-1:0.0 can0: device disconnected
| [ 1367.059384][ T8420] kmemleak: 20 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmem)

So, all allocated buffers should be freed with usb_free_coherent()
explicitly

NOTE:
The same pattern for allocating and freeing coherent buffers
is used in drivers/net/can/usb/kvaser_usb/kvaser_usb_core.c

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47231 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
