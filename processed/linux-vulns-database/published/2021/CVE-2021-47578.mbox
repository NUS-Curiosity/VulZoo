Subject: CVE-2021-47578: scsi: scsi_debug: Don't call kcalloc() if size arg is zero

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: scsi_debug: Don't call kcalloc() if size arg is zero

If the size arg to kcalloc() is zero, it returns ZERO_SIZE_PTR.  Because of
that, for a following NULL pointer check to work on the returned pointer,
kcalloc() must not be called with the size arg equal to zero. Return early
without error before the kcalloc() call if size arg is zero.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
