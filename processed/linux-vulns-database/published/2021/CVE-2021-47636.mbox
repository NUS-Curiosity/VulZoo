Subject: CVE-2021-47636: ubifs: Fix read out-of-bounds in ubifs_wbuf_write_nolock()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: Fix read out-of-bounds in ubifs_wbuf_write_nolock()

Function ubifs_wbuf_write_nolock() may access buf out of bounds in
following process:

ubifs_wbuf_write_nolock():
  aligned_len = ALIGN(len, 8);   // Assume len = 4089, aligned_len = 4096
  if (aligned_len <= wbuf->avail) ... // Not satisfy
  if (wbuf->used) {
    ubifs_leb_write()  // Fill some data in avail wbuf
    len -= wbuf->avail;   // len is still not 8-bytes aligned
    aligned_len -= wbuf->avail;
  }
  n = aligned_len >> c->max_write_shift;
  if (n) {
    n <<= c->max_write_shift;
    err = ubifs_leb_write(c, wbuf->lnum, buf + written,
                          wbuf->offs, n);
    // n > len, read out of bounds less than 8(n-len) bytes
  }

, which can be catched by KASAN:

    wb_workfn+0x8af/0xb80

Function ubifs_wbuf_write_nolock() accepts that parameter 'len' is not 8
bytes aligned, the 'len' represents the true length of buf (which is
allocated in 'ubifs_jnl_xxx', eg. ubifs_jnl_write_inode), so
ubifs_wbuf_write_nolock() must handle the length read from 'buf' carefully
to write leb safely.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
