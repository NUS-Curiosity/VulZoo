Subject: CVE-2021-47180: NFC: nci: fix memory leak in nci_allocate_device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFC: nci: fix memory leak in nci_allocate_device

nfcmrvl_disconnect fails to free the hci_dev field in struct nci_dev.
Fix this by freeing hci_dev in nci_free_device.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
