Subject: CVE-2021-46934: i2c: validate user data in compat ioctl

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: validate user data in compat ioctl

Wrong user data may cause warning in i2c_transfer(), ex: zero msgs.
Userspace should not be able to trigger warnings, so this patch adds
validation checks for user data in compact ioctl to prevent reported
warnings

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46934 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
