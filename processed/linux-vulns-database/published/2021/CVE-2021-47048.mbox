Subject: CVE-2021-47048: spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix use-after-free in zynqmp_qspi_exec_op

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix use-after-free in zynqmp_qspi_exec_op

When handling op->addr, it is using the buffer "tmpbuf" which has been
freed. This will trigger a use-after-free KASAN warning. Let's use
temporary variables to store op->addr.val and op->cmd.opcode to fix
this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47048 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
