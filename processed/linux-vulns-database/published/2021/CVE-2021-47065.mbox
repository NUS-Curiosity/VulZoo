Subject: CVE-2021-47065: rtw88: Fix array overrun in rtw_get_tx_power_params()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtw88: Fix array overrun in rtw_get_tx_power_params()

Using a kernel with the Undefined Behaviour Sanity Checker (UBSAN) enabled, the
following array overrun is logged:

================================================================================
UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in /home/finger/wireless-drivers-next/drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtw88/phy.c:1789:34

================================================================================

The statement where an array is being overrun is shown in the following snippet:

	if (rate <= DESC_RATE11M)
		tx_power = pwr_idx_2g->cck_base[group];
	else
====>		tx_power = pwr_idx_2g->bw40_base[group];

The associated arrays are defined in main.h as follows:

struct rtw_2g_txpwr_idx {
	u8 cck_base[6];
	u8 bw40_base[5];
	struct rtw_2g_1s_pwr_idx_diff ht_1s_diff;
	struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_2s_diff;
	struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_3s_diff;
	struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_4s_diff;
};

The problem arises because the value of group is 5 for channel 14. The trivial
increase in the dimension of bw40_base fails as this struct must match the layout of
efuse. The fix is to add the rate as an argument to rtw_get_channel_group() and set
the group for channel 14 to 4 if rate <= DESC_RATE11M.

This patch fixes commit fa6dfe6bff24 ("rtw88: resolve order of tx power setting routines")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47065 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
