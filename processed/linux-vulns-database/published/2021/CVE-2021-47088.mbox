Subject: CVE-2021-47088: mm/damon/dbgfs: protect targets destructions with kdamond_lock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/dbgfs: protect targets destructions with kdamond_lock

DAMON debugfs interface iterates current monitoring targets in
'dbgfs_target_ids_read()' while holding the corresponding
'kdamond_lock'.  However, it also destructs the monitoring targets in
'dbgfs_before_terminate()' without holding the lock.  This can result in
a use_after_free bug.  This commit avoids the race by protecting the
destruction with the corresponding 'kdamond_lock'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47088 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
