Subject: CVE-2021-47338: fbmem: Do not delete the mode that is still in use

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbmem: Do not delete the mode that is still in use

The execution of fb_delete_videomode() is not based on the result of the
previous fbcon_mode_deleted(). As a result, the mode is directly deleted,
regardless of whether it is still in use, which may cause UAF.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
