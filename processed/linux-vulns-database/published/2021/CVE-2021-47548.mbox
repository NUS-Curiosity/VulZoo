Subject: CVE-2021-47548: ethernet: hisilicon: hns: hns_dsaf_misc: fix a possible array overflow in hns_dsaf_ge_srst_by_port()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ethernet: hisilicon: hns: hns_dsaf_misc: fix a possible array overflow in hns_dsaf_ge_srst_by_port()

The if statement:
  if (port >= DSAF_GE_NUM)
        return;

limits the value of port less than DSAF_GE_NUM (i.e., 8).
However, if the value of port is 6 or 7, an array overflow could occur:
  port_rst_off = dsaf_dev->mac_cb[port]->port_rst_off;

because the length of dsaf_dev->mac_cb is DSAF_MAX_PORT_NUM (i.e., 6).

To fix this possible array overflow, we first check port and if it is
greater than or equal to DSAF_MAX_PORT_NUM, the function returns.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47548 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
