Subject: CVE-2021-47459: can: j1939: j1939_netdev_start(): fix UAF for rx_kref of j1939_priv

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: j1939: j1939_netdev_start(): fix UAF for rx_kref of j1939_priv

It will trigger UAF for rx_kref of j1939_priv as following.

        cpu0                                    cpu1
j1939_sk_bind(socket0, ndev0, ...)
j1939_netdev_start
                                        j1939_sk_bind(socket1, ndev0, ...)
                                        j1939_netdev_start
j1939_priv_set
                                        j1939_priv_get_by_ndev_locked
j1939_jsk_add
.....
j1939_netdev_stop
kref_put_lock(&priv->rx_kref, ...)
                                        kref_get(&priv->rx_kref, ...)
                                        REFCOUNT_WARN("addition on 0;...")

====================================================
refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.

The rx_kref's kref_get() and kref_put() should use j1939_netdev_lock to
protect.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47459 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
