Subject: CVE-2021-47217: x86/hyperv: Fix NULL deref in set_hv_tscchange_cb() if Hyper-V setup fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/hyperv: Fix NULL deref in set_hv_tscchange_cb() if Hyper-V setup fails

Check for a valid hv_vp_index array prior to derefencing hv_vp_index when
setting Hyper-V's TSC change callback.  If Hyper-V setup failed in
hyperv_init(), the kernel will still report that it's running under
Hyper-V, but will have silently disabled nearly all functionality.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
