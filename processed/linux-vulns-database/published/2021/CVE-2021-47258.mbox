Subject: CVE-2021-47258: scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi_host_alloc()

After device is initialized via device_initialize(), or its name is set via
dev_set_name(), the device has to be freed via put_device().  Otherwise
device name will be leaked because it is allocated dynamically in
dev_set_name().

Fix the leak by replacing kfree() with put_device(). Since
scsi_host_dev_release() properly handles IDA and kthread removal, remove
special-casing these from the error handling as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47258 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
