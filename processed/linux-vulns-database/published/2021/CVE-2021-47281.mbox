Subject: CVE-2021-47281: ALSA: seq: Fix race of snd_seq_timer_open()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: seq: Fix race of snd_seq_timer_open()

The timer instance per queue is exclusive, and snd_seq_timer_open()
should have managed the concurrent accesses.  It looks as if it's
checking the already existing timer instance at the beginning, but
it's not right, because there is no protection, hence any later
concurrent call of snd_seq_timer_open() may override the timer
instance easily.  This may result in UAF, as the leftover timer
instance can keep running while the queue itself gets closed, as
spotted by syzkaller recently.

For avoiding the race, add a proper check at the assignment of
tmr->timeri again, and return -EBUSY if it's been already registered.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47281 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
