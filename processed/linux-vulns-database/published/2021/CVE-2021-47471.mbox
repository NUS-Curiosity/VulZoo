Subject: CVE-2021-47471: drm: mxsfb: Fix NULL pointer dereference crash on unload

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: mxsfb: Fix NULL pointer dereference crash on unload

The mxsfb->crtc.funcs may already be NULL when unloading the driver,
in which case calling mxsfb_irq_disable() via drm_irq_uninstall() from
mxsfb_unload() leads to NULL pointer dereference.

Since all we care about is masking the IRQ and mxsfb->base is still
valid, just use that to clear and mask the IRQ.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47471 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
