Subject: CVE-2021-47596: net: hns3: fix use-after-free bug in hclgevf_send_mbx_msg

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: fix use-after-free bug in hclgevf_send_mbx_msg

Currently, the hns3_remove function firstly uninstall client instance,
and then uninstall acceletion engine device. The netdevice is freed in
client instance uninstall process, but acceletion engine device uninstall
process still use it to trace runtime information. This causes a use after
free problem.

So fixes it by check the instance register state to avoid use after free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47596 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
