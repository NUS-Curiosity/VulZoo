Subject: CVE-2021-47244: mptcp: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options

The TCP option parser in mptcp (mptcp_get_options) could read one byte
out of bounds. When the length is 1, the execution flow gets into the
loop, reads one byte of the opcode, and if the opcode is neither
TCPOPT_EOL nor TCPOPT_NOP, it reads one more byte, which exceeds the
length of 1.

This fix is inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 ("ipv4: tcp_input: fix stack
out of bounds when parsing TCP options.").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47244 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
