Subject: CVE-2021-46951: tpm: efi: Use local variable for calculating final log size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tpm: efi: Use local variable for calculating final log size

When tpm_read_log_efi is called multiple times, which happens when
one loads and unloads a TPM2 driver multiple times, then the global
variable efi_tpm_final_log_size will at some point become a negative
number due to the subtraction of final_events_preboot_size occurring
each time. Use a local variable to avoid this integer underflow.

The following issue is now resolved:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
