Subject: CVE-2021-47064: mt76: fix potential DMA mapping leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mt76: fix potential DMA mapping leak

With buf uninitialized in mt76_dma_tx_queue_skb_raw, its field skip_unmap
could potentially inherit a non-zero value from stack garbage.
If this happens, it will cause DMA mappings for MCU command frames to not be
unmapped after completion

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47064 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
