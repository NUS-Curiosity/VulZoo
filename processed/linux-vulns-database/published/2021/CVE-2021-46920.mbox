Subject: CVE-2021-46920: dmaengine: idxd: Fix clobbering of SWERR overflow bit on writeback

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Fix clobbering of SWERR overflow bit on writeback

Current code blindly writes over the SWERR and the OVERFLOW bits. Write
back the bits actually read instead so the driver avoids clobbering the
OVERFLOW bit that comes after the register is read.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46920 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
