Subject: CVE-2021-47446: drm/msm/a4xx: fix error handling in a4xx_gpu_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/a4xx: fix error handling in a4xx_gpu_init()

This code returns 1 on error instead of a negative error.  It leads to
an Oops in the caller.  A second problem is that the check for
"if (ret != -ENODATA)" cannot be true because "ret" is set to 1.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47446 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 5.11 with commit 5785dd7a8ef0 and fixed in 5.14.14 with commit 3962d626eb3e

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/a4xx_gpu.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3962d626eb3e3b23ebb2e2a61537fa764acbfe11
