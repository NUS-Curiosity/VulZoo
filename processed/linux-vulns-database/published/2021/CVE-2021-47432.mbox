Subject: CVE-2021-47432: lib/generic-radix-tree.c: Don't overflow in peek()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib/generic-radix-tree.c: Don't overflow in peek()

When we started spreading new inode numbers throughout most of the 64
bit inode space, that triggered some corner case bugs, in particular
some integer overflows related to the radix tree code. Oops.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47432 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
