Subject: CVE-2021-47413: usb: chipidea: ci_hdrc_imx: Also search for 'phys' phandle

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: chipidea: ci_hdrc_imx: Also search for 'phys' phandle

When passing 'phys' in the devicetree to describe the USB PHY phandle
(which is the recommended way according to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/ci-hdrc-usb2.txt) the
following NULL pointer dereference is observed on i.MX7 and i.MX8MM:

[    1.489344] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000098
[    1.498170] Mem abort info:

[    1.573973] lr : imx7d_charger_detection+0x22c/0x510

This happens because the charger functions check for the phy presence
inside the imx_usbmisc_data structure (data->usb_phy), but the chipidea
core populates the usb_phy passed via 'phys' inside 'struct ci_hdrc'
(ci->usb_phy) instead.

This causes the NULL pointer dereference inside imx7d_charger_detection().

Fix it by also searching for 'phys' in case 'fsl,usbphy' is not found.

Tested on a imx7s-warp board.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47413 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
