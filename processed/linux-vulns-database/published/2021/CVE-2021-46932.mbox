Subject: CVE-2021-46932: Input: appletouch - initialize work before device registration

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: appletouch - initialize work before device registration

Syzbot has reported warning in __flush_work(). This warning is caused by
work->func == NULL, which means missing work initialization.

This may happen, since input_dev->close() calls
cancel_work_sync(&dev->work), but dev->work initalization happens _after_
input_register_device() call.

So this patch moves dev->work initialization before registering input
device

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46932 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
