Subject: CVE-2021-46968: s390/zcrypt: fix zcard and zqueue hot-unplug memleak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/zcrypt: fix zcard and zqueue hot-unplug memleak

Tests with kvm and a kmemdebug kernel showed, that on hot unplug the
zcard and zqueue structs for the unplugged card or queue are not
properly freed because of a mismatch with get/put for the embedded
kref counter.

This fix now adjusts the handling of the kref counters. With init the
kref counter starts with 1. This initial value needs to drop to zero
with the unregister of the card or queue to trigger the release and
free the object.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46968 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
