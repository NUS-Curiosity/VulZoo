Subject: CVE-2021-47168: NFS: fix an incorrect limit in filelayout_decode_layout()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: fix an incorrect limit in filelayout_decode_layout()

The "sizeof(struct nfs_fh)" is two bytes too large and could lead to
memory corruption.  It should be NFS_MAXFHSIZE because that's the size
of the ->data[] buffer.

I reversed the size of the arguments to put the variable on the left.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47168 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
