Subject: CVE-2021-47037: ASoC: q6afe-clocks: fix reprobing of the driver

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: q6afe-clocks: fix reprobing of the driver

Q6afe-clocks driver can get reprobed. For example if the APR services
are restarted after the firmware crash. However currently Q6afe-clocks
driver will oops because hw.init will get cleared during first _probe
call. Rewrite the driver to fill the clock data at runtime rather than
using big static array of clocks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47037 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
