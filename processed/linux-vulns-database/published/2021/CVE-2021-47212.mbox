Subject: CVE-2021-47212: net/mlx5: Update error handler for UCTX and UMEM

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Update error handler for UCTX and UMEM

In the fast unload flow, the device state is set to internal error,
which indicates that the driver started the destroy process.
In this case, when a destroy command is being executed, it should return
MLX5_CMD_STAT_OK.
Fix MLX5_CMD_OP_DESTROY_UCTX and MLX5_CMD_OP_DESTROY_UMEM to return OK
instead of EIO.

This fixes a call trace in the umem release process -

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
