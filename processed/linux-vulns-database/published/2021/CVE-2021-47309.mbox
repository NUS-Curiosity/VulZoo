Subject: CVE-2021-47309: net: validate lwtstate->data before returning from skb_tunnel_info()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: validate lwtstate->data before returning from skb_tunnel_info()

skb_tunnel_info() returns pointer of lwtstate->data as ip_tunnel_info
type without validation. lwtstate->data can have various types such as
mpls_iptunnel_encap, etc and these are not compatible.
So skb_tunnel_info() should validate before returning that pointer.

Splat looks like:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
