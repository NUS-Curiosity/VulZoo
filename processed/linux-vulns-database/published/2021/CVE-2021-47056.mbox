Subject: CVE-2021-47056: crypto: qat - ADF_STATUS_PF_RUNNING should be set after adf_dev_init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qat - ADF_STATUS_PF_RUNNING should be set after adf_dev_init

ADF_STATUS_PF_RUNNING is (only) used and checked by adf_vf2pf_shutdown()
before calling adf_iov_putmsg()->mutex_lock(vf2pf_lock), however the
vf2pf_lock is initialized in adf_dev_init(), which can fail and when it
fail, the vf2pf_lock is either not initialized or destroyed, a subsequent
use of vf2pf_lock will cause issue.
To fix this issue, only set this flag if adf_dev_init() returns 0.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
