Subject: CVE-2021-47481: RDMA/mlx5: Initialize the ODP xarray when creating an ODP MR

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Initialize the ODP xarray when creating an ODP MR

Normally the zero fill would hide the missing initialization, but an
errant set to desc_size in reg_create() causes a crash:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5f6995295f65d1ee6f36d466d26afd98eb797afe
