Subject: CVE-2021-47384: hwmon: (w83793) Fix NULL pointer dereference by removing unnecessary structure field

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (w83793) Fix NULL pointer dereference by removing unnecessary structure field

If driver read tmp value sufficient for
(tmp & 0x08) && (!(tmp & 0x80)) && ((tmp & 0x7) == ((tmp >> 4) & 0x7))
from device then Null pointer dereference occurs.
(It is possible if tmp = 0b0xyz1xyz, where same literals mean same numbers)
Also lm75[] does not serve a purpose anymore after switching to
devm_i2c_new_dummy_device() in w83791d_detect_subclients().

The patch fixes possible NULL pointer dereference by removing lm75[].

Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
