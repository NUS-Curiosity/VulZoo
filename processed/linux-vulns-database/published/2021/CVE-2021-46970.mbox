Subject: CVE-2021-46970: bus: mhi: pci_generic: Remove WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag from state workqueue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: mhi: pci_generic: Remove WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flag from state workqueue

A recent change created a dedicated workqueue for the state-change work
with WQ_HIGHPRI (no strong reason for that) and WQ_MEM_RECLAIM flags,
but the state-change work (mhi_pm_st_worker) does not guarantee forward
progress under memory pressure, and will even wait on various memory
allocations when e.g. creating devices, loading firmware, etc... The
work is then not part of a memory reclaim path...

Moreover, this causes a warning in check_flush_dependency() since we end
up in code that flushes a non-reclaim workqueue:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
