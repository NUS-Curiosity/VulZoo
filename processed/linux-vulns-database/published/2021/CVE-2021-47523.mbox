Subject: CVE-2021-47523: IB/hfi1: Fix leak of rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/hfi1: Fix leak of rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr

This buffer is currently allocated in hfi1_init():

	if (reinit)
		ret = init_after_reset(dd);
	else
		ret = loadtime_init(dd);
	if (ret)
		goto done;

	/* allocate dummy tail memory for all receive contexts */
	dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr = dma_alloc_coherent(&dd->pcidev->dev,
							 sizeof(u64),
							 &dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_dma,
							 GFP_KERNEL);

	if (!dd->rcvhdrtail_dummy_kvaddr) {
		dd_dev_err(dd, "cannot allocate dummy tail memory\n");
		ret = -ENOMEM;
		goto done;
	}

The reinit triggered path will overwrite the old allocation and leak it.

Fix by moving the allocation to hfi1_alloc_devdata() and the deallocation
to hfi1_free_devdata().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47523 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
