Subject: CVE-2021-47098: hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer overflow/underflow in hysteresis calculations

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer overflow/underflow in hysteresis calculations

Commit b50aa49638c7 ("hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer underflows of
temperature calculations") addressed a number of underflow situations
when writing temperature limits. However, it missed one situation, seen
when an attempt is made to set the hysteresis value to MAX_LONG and the
critical temperature limit is negative.

Use clamp_val() when setting the hysteresis temperature to ensure that
the provided value can never overflow or underflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47098 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d105f30bea9104c590a9e5b495cb8a49bdfe405f
