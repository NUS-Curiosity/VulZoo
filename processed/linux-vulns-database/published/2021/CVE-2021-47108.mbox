Subject: CVE-2021-47108: drm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf

In commit 41ca9caaae0b
("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add check for CEA modes only") a check
for CEA modes was added to function mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid()
in order to address possible issues on MT8167;
moreover, with commit c91026a938c2
("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add optional limit on maximal HDMI mode clock")
another similar check was introduced.

Unfortunately though, at the time of writing, MT8173 does not provide
any mtk_hdmi_conf structure and this is crashing the kernel with NULL
pointer upon entering mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid(), which happens as
soon as a HDMI cable gets plugged in.

To fix this regression, add a NULL pointer check for hdmi->conf in the
said function, restoring HDMI functionality and avoiding NULL pointer
kernel panics.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47108 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/71d07ebc5000b9c1d140e99e7493b0bafa954776
