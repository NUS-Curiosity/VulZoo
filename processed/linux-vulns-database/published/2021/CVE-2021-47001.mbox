Subject: CVE-2021-47001: xprtrdma: Fix cwnd update ordering

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xprtrdma: Fix cwnd update ordering

After a reconnect, the reply handler is opening the cwnd (and thus
enabling more RPC Calls to be sent) /before/ rpcrdma_post_recvs()
can post enough Receive WRs to receive their replies. This causes an
RNR and the new connection is lost immediately.

The race is most clearly exposed when KASAN and disconnect injection
are enabled. This slows down rpcrdma_rep_create() enough to allow
the send side to post a bunch of RPC Calls before the Receive
completion handler can invoke ib_post_recv().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47001 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
