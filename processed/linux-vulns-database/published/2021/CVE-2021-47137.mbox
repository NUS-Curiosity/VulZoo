Subject: CVE-2021-47137: net: lantiq: fix memory corruption in RX ring

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: lantiq: fix memory corruption in RX ring

In a situation where memory allocation or dma mapping fails, an
invalid address is programmed into the descriptor. This can lead
to memory corruption. If the memory allocation fails, DMA should
reuse the previous skb and mapping and drop the packet. This patch
also increments rx drop counter.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47137 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
