Subject: CVE-2021-47442: NFC: digital: fix possible memory leak in digital_in_send_sdd_req()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFC: digital: fix possible memory leak in digital_in_send_sdd_req()

'skb' is allocated in digital_in_send_sdd_req(), but not free when
digital_in_send_cmd() failed, which will cause memory leak. Fix it
by freeing 'skb' if digital_in_send_cmd() return failed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47442 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
