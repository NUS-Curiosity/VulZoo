Subject: CVE-2021-47111: xen-netback: take a reference to the RX task thread

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen-netback: take a reference to the RX task thread

Do this in order to prevent the task from being freed if the thread
returns (which can be triggered by the frontend) before the call to
kthread_stop done as part of the backend tear down. Not taking the
reference will lead to a use-after-free in that scenario. Such
reference was taken before but dropped as part of the rework done in
2ac061ce97f4.

Reintroduce the reference taking and add a comment this time
explaining why it's needed.

This is XSA-374 / CVE-2021-28691.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47111 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
