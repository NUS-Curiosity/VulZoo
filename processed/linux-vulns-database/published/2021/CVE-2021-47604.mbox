Subject: CVE-2021-47604: vduse: check that offset is within bounds in get_config()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vduse: check that offset is within bounds in get_config()

This condition checks "len" but it does not check "offset" and that
could result in an out of bounds read if "offset > dev->config_size".
The problem is that since both variables are unsigned the
"dev->config_size - offset" subtraction would result in a very high
unsigned value.

I think these checks might not be necessary because "len" and "offset"
are supposed to already have been validated using the
vhost_vdpa_config_validate() function.  But I do not know the code
perfectly, and I like to be safe.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47604 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ebbbc5fea3f648175df1aa3f127c78eb0252cc2a
