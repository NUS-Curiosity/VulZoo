Subject: CVE-2021-46994: can: mcp251x: fix resume from sleep before interface was brought up

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: mcp251x: fix resume from sleep before interface was brought up

Since 8ce8c0abcba3 the driver queues work via priv->restart_work when
resuming after suspend, even when the interface was not previously
enabled. This causes a null dereference error as the workqueue is only
allocated and initialized in mcp251x_open().

To fix this we move the workqueue init to mcp251x_can_probe() as there
is no reason to do it later and repeat it whenever mcp251x_open() is
called.

[mkl: fix error handling in mcp251x_stop()]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46994 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
