Subject: CVE-2021-47477: comedi: dt9812: fix DMA buffers on stack

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: dt9812: fix DMA buffers on stack

USB transfer buffers are typically mapped for DMA and must not be
allocated on the stack or transfers will fail.

Allocate proper transfer buffers in the various command helpers and
return an error on short transfers instead of acting on random stack
data.

Note that this also fixes a stack info leak on systems where DMA is not
used as 32 bytes are always sent to the device regardless of how short
the command is.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47477 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
