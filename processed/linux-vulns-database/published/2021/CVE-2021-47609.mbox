Subject: CVE-2021-47609: firmware: arm_scpi: Fix string overflow in SCPI genpd driver

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: arm_scpi: Fix string overflow in SCPI genpd driver

Without the bound checks for scpi_pd->name, it could result in the buffer
overflow when copying the SCPI device name from the corresponding device
tree node as the name string is set at maximum size of 30.

Let us fix it by using devm_kasprintf so that the string buffer is
allocated dynamically.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47609 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
