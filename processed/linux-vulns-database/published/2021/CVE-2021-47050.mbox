Subject: CVE-2021-47050: memory: renesas-rpc-if: fix possible NULL pointer dereference of resource

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

memory: renesas-rpc-if: fix possible NULL pointer dereference of resource

The platform_get_resource_byname() can return NULL which would be
immediately dereferenced by resource_size().  Instead dereference it
after validating the resource.

Addresses-Coverity: Dereference null return value

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47050 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
