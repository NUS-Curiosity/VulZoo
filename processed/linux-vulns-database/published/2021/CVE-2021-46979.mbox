Subject: CVE-2021-46979: iio: core: fix ioctl handlers removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: core: fix ioctl handlers removal

Currently ioctl handlers are removed twice. For the first time during
iio_device_unregister() then later on inside
iio_device_unregister_eventset() and iio_buffers_free_sysfs_and_mask().
Double free leads to kernel panic.

Fix this by not touching ioctl handlers list directly but rather
letting code responsible for registration call the matching cleanup
routine itself.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46979 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
