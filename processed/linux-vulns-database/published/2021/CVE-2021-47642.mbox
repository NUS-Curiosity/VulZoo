Subject: CVE-2021-47642: video: fbdev: nvidiafb: Use strscpy() to prevent buffer overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

video: fbdev: nvidiafb: Use strscpy() to prevent buffer overflow

Coverity complains of a possible buffer overflow. However,
given the 'static' scope of nvidia_setup_i2c_bus() it looks
like that can't happen after examiniing the call sites.

CID 19036 (#1 of 1): Copy into fixed size buffer (STRING_OVERFLOW)
1. fixed_size_dest: You might overrun the 48-character fixed-size string
  chan->adapter.name by copying name without checking the length.
2. parameter_as_source: Note: This defect has an elevated risk because the
  source argument is a parameter of the current function.
 89        strcpy(chan->adapter.name, name);

Fix this warning by using strscpy() which will silence the warning and
prevent any future buffer overflows should the names used to identify the
channel become much longer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47642 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
