Subject: CVE-2021-47351: ubifs: Fix races between xattr_{set|get} and listxattr operations

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: Fix races between xattr_{set|get} and listxattr operations

UBIFS may occur some problems with concurrent xattr_{set|get} and
listxattr operations, such as assertion failure, memory corruption,
stale xattr value[1].

Fix it by importing a new rw-lock in @ubifs_inode to serilize write
operations on xattr, concurrent read operations are still effective,
just like ext4.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
