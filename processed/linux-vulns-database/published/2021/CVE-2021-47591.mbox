Subject: CVE-2021-47591: mptcp: remove tcp ulp setsockopt support

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: remove tcp ulp setsockopt support

TCP_ULP setsockopt cannot be used for mptcp because its already
used internally to plumb subflow (tcp) sockets to the mptcp layer.

syzbot managed to trigger a crash for mptcp connections that are
in fallback mode:

KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000020-0x0000000000000027]
CPU: 1 PID: 1083 Comm: syz-executor.3 Not tainted 5.16.0-rc2-syzkaller #0

Remove support for TCP_ULP setsockopt.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47591 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3de0c86d42f841d1d64f316cd949e65c566f0734
