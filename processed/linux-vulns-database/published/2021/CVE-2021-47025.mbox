Subject: CVE-2021-47025: iommu/mediatek: Always enable the clk on resume

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/mediatek: Always enable the clk on resume

In mtk_iommu_runtime_resume always enable the clk, even
if m4u_dom is null. Otherwise the 'suspend' cb might
disable the clk which is already disabled causing the warning:

In addition, we now don't need to enable the clock from the
function mtk_iommu_hw_init since it is already enabled by the resume.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47025 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5cad9e2caa9613fdcd246bd4ebf0ffbec1cba2ca
