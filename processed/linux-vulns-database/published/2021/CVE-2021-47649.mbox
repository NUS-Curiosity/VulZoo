Subject: CVE-2021-47649: udmabuf: validate ubuf->pagecount

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udmabuf: validate ubuf->pagecount

Syzbot has reported GPF in sg_alloc_append_table_from_pages(). The
problem was in ubuf->pages == ZERO_PTR.

ubuf->pagecount is calculated from arguments passed from user-space. If
user creates udmabuf with list.size == 0 then ubuf->pagecount will be
also equal to zero; it causes kmalloc_array() to return ZERO_PTR.

Fix it by validating ubuf->pagecount before passing it to
kmalloc_array().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47649 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
