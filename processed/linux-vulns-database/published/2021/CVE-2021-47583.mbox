Subject: CVE-2021-47583: media: mxl111sf: change mutex_init() location

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mxl111sf: change mutex_init() location

Syzbot reported, that mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() uses uninitialized
mutex. The problem was in wrong mutex_init() location.

Previous mutex_init(&state->msg_lock) call was in ->init() function, but
dvb_usbv2_init() has this order of calls:

	dvb_usbv2_init()
	  dvb_usbv2_adapter_init()
	    dvb_usbv2_adapter_frontend_init()
	      props->frontend_attach()

	  props->init()

Since mxl111sf_* devices call mxl111sf_ctrl_msg() in ->frontend_attach()
internally we need to initialize state->msg_lock before
frontend_attach(). To achieve it, ->probe() call added to all mxl111sf_*
devices, which will simply initiaize mutex.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47583 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
