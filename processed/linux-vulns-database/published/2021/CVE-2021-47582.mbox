Subject: CVE-2021-47582: USB: core: Make do_proc_control() and do_proc_bulk() killable

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: core: Make do_proc_control() and do_proc_bulk() killable

The USBDEVFS_CONTROL and USBDEVFS_BULK ioctls invoke
usb_start_wait_urb(), which contains an uninterruptible wait with a
user-specified timeout value.  If timeout value is very large and the
device being accessed does not respond in a reasonable amount of time,
the kernel will complain about "Task X blocked for more than N
seconds", as found in testing by syzbot:

INFO: task syz-executor.0:8700 blocked for more than 143 seconds.
      Not tainted 5.14.0-rc7-syzkaller #0
"echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/hung_task_timeout_secs" disables this message.
task:syz-executor.0  state:D stack:23192 pid: 8700 ppid:  8455 flags:0x00004004

To fix this problem, this patch replaces usbfs's calls to
usb_control_msg() and usb_bulk_msg() with special-purpose code that
does essentially the same thing (as recommended in the comment for
usb_start_wait_urb()), except that it always uses a killable wait and
it uses GFP_KERNEL rather than GFP_NOIO.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47582 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/403716741c6c2c510dce44e88f085a740f535de6
