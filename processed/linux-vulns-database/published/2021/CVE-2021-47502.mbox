Subject: CVE-2021-47502: ASoC: codecs: wcd934x: handle channel mappping list correctly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: codecs: wcd934x: handle channel mappping list correctly

Currently each channel is added as list to dai channel list, however
there is danger of adding same channel to multiple dai channel list
which endups corrupting the other list where its already added.

This patch ensures that the channel is actually free before adding to
the dai channel list and also ensures that the channel is on the list
before deleting it.

This check was missing previously, and we did not hit this issue as
we were testing very simple usecases with sequence of amixer commands.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47502 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
