Subject: CVE-2021-47441: mlxsw: thermal: Fix out-of-bounds memory accesses

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: thermal: Fix out-of-bounds memory accesses

Currently, mlxsw allows cooling states to be set above the maximum
cooling state supported by the driver:

 # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/type
 mlxsw_fan
 # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/max_state
 10
 # echo 18 > /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/cur_state
 # echo $?
 0

This results in out-of-bounds memory accesses when thermal state
transition statistics are enabled (CONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS=y), as the
transition table is accessed with a too large index (state) [1].

According to the thermal maintainer, it is the responsibility of the
driver to reject such operations [2].

Therefore, return an error when the state to be set exceeds the maximum
cooling state supported by the driver.

To avoid dead code, as suggested by the thermal maintainer [3],
partially revert commit a421ce088ac8 ("mlxsw: core: Extend cooling
device with cooling levels") that tried to interpret these invalid
cooling states (above the maximum) in a special way. The cooling levels
array is not removed in order to prevent the fans going below 20% PWM,
which would cause them to get stuck at 0% PWM.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
