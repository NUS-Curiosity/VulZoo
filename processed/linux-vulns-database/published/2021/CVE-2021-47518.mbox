Subject: CVE-2021-47518: nfc: fix potential NULL pointer deref in nfc_genl_dump_ses_done

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: fix potential NULL pointer deref in nfc_genl_dump_ses_done

The done() netlink callback nfc_genl_dump_ses_done() should check if
received argument is non-NULL, because its allocation could fail earlier
in dumpit() (nfc_genl_dump_ses()).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47518 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
