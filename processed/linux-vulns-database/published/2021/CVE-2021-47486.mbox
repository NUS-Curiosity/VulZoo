Subject: CVE-2021-47486: riscv, bpf: Fix potential NULL dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv, bpf: Fix potential NULL dereference

The bpf_jit_binary_free() function requires a non-NULL argument. When
the RISC-V BPF JIT fails to converge in NR_JIT_ITERATIONS steps,
jit_data->header will be NULL, which triggers a NULL
dereference. Avoid this by checking the argument, prior calling the
function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47486 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
