Subject: CVE-2021-47080: RDMA/core: Prevent divide-by-zero error triggered by the user

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/core: Prevent divide-by-zero error triggered by the user

The user_entry_size is supplied by the user and later used as a
denominator to calculate number of entries. The zero supplied by the user
will trigger the following divide-by-zero error:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/66ab7fcdac34b890017f04f391507ef5b2b89a13
