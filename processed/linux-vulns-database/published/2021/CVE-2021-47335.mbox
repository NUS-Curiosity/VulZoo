Subject: CVE-2021-47335: f2fs: fix to avoid racing on fsync_entry_slab by multi filesystem instances

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid racing on fsync_entry_slab by multi filesystem instances

As syzbot reported, there is an use-after-free issue during f2fs recovery:

Use-after-free write at 0xffff88823bc16040 (in kfence-#10):

 do_syscall_64+0x3f/0xb0 arch/x86/entry/common.c:47

The root cause is multi f2fs filesystem instances can race on accessing
global fsync_entry_slab pointer, result in use-after-free issue of slab
cache, fixes to init/destroy this slab cache only once during module
init/destroy procedure to avoid this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47335 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
