Subject: CVE-2021-47407: KVM: x86: Handle SRCU initialization failure during page track init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Handle SRCU initialization failure during page track init

Check the return of init_srcu_struct(), which can fail due to OOM, when
initializing the page track mechanism.  Lack of checking leads to a NULL
pointer deref found by a modified syzkaller.

[Move the call towards the beginning of kvm_arch_init_vm. - Paolo]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47407 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
