Subject: CVE-2021-47110: x86/kvm: Disable kvmclock on all CPUs on shutdown

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/kvm: Disable kvmclock on all CPUs on shutdown

Currenly, we disable kvmclock from machine_shutdown() hook and this
only happens for boot CPU. We need to disable it for all CPUs to
guard against memory corruption e.g. on restore from hibernate.

Note, writing '0' to kvmclock MSR doesn't clear memory location, it
just prevents hypervisor from updating the location so for the short
while after write and while CPU is still alive, the clock remains usable
and correct so we don't need to switch to some other clocksource.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47110 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
