Subject: CVE-2021-47558: net: stmmac: Disable Tx queues when reconfiguring the interface

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: Disable Tx queues when reconfiguring the interface

The Tx queues were not disabled in situations where the driver needed to
stop the interface to apply a new configuration. This could result in a
kernel panic when doing any of the 3 following actions:
* reconfiguring the number of queues (ethtool -L)
* reconfiguring the size of the ring buffers (ethtool -G)
* installing/removing an XDP program (ip l set dev ethX xdp)

Prevent the panic by making sure netif_tx_disable is called when stopping
an interface.

Without this patch, the following kernel panic can be observed when doing
any of the actions above:

Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff80001238d040

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a92f0eebb8dc008b9e8c51c6f7b8c93b27a29a43
