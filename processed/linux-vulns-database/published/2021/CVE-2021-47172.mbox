Subject: CVE-2021-47172: iio: adc: ad7124: Fix potential overflow due to non sequential channel numbers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: ad7124: Fix potential overflow due to non sequential channel numbers

Channel numbering must start at 0 and then not have any holes, or
it is possible to overflow the available storage.  Note this bug was
introduced as part of a fix to ensure we didn't rely on the ordering
of child nodes.  So we need to support arbitrary ordering but they all
need to be there somewhere.

Note I hit this when using qemu to test the rest of this series.
Arguably this isn't the best fix, but it is probably the most minimal
option for backporting etc.

Alexandru's sign-off is here because he carried this patch in a larger
set that Jonathan then applied.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47172 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
