Subject: CVE-2021-47565: scsi: mpt3sas: Fix kernel panic during drive powercycle test

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpt3sas: Fix kernel panic during drive powercycle test

While looping over shost's sdev list it is possible that one
of the drives is getting removed and its sas_target object is
freed but its sdev object remains intact.

Consequently, a kernel panic can occur while the driver is trying to access
the sas_address field of sas_target object without also checking the
sas_target object for NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47565 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
