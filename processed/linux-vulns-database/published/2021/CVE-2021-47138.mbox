Subject: CVE-2021-47138: cxgb4: avoid accessing registers when clearing filters

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxgb4: avoid accessing registers when clearing filters

Hardware register having the server TID base can contain
invalid values when adapter is in bad state (for example,
due to AER fatal error). Reading these invalid values in the
register can lead to out-of-bound memory access. So, fix
by using the saved server TID base when clearing filters.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47138 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
