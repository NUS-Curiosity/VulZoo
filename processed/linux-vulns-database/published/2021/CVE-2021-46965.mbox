Subject: CVE-2021-46965: mtd: physmap: physmap-bt1-rom: Fix unintentional stack access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: physmap: physmap-bt1-rom: Fix unintentional stack access

Cast &data to (char *) in order to avoid unintentionally accessing
the stack.

Notice that data is of type u32, so any increment to &data
will be in the order of 4-byte chunks, and this piece of code
is actually intended to be a byte offset.

Addresses-Coverity-ID: 1497765 ("Out-of-bounds access")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46965 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
