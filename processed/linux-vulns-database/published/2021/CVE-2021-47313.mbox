Subject: CVE-2021-47313: cpufreq: CPPC: Fix potential memleak in cppc_cpufreq_cpu_init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: CPPC: Fix potential memleak in cppc_cpufreq_cpu_init

It's a classic example of memleak, we allocate something, we fail and
never free the resources.

Make sure we free all resources on policy ->init() failures.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
