Subject: CVE-2021-47556: ethtool: ioctl: fix potential NULL deref in ethtool_set_coalesce()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ethtool: ioctl: fix potential NULL deref in ethtool_set_coalesce()

ethtool_set_coalesce() now uses both the .get_coalesce() and
.set_coalesce() callbacks. But the check for their availability is
buggy, so changing the coalesce settings on a device where the driver
provides only _one_ of the callbacks results in a NULL pointer
dereference instead of an -EOPNOTSUPP.

Fix the condition so that the availability of both callbacks is
ensured. This also matches the netlink code.

Note that reproducing this requires some effort - it only affects the
legacy ioctl path, and needs a specific combination of driver options:
- have .get_coalesce() and .coalesce_supported but no
 .set_coalesce(), or
- have .set_coalesce() but no .get_coalesce(). Here eg. ethtool doesn't
  cause the crash as it first attempts to call ethtool_get_coalesce()
  and bails out on error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47556 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
