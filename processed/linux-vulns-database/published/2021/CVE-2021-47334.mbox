Subject: CVE-2021-47334: misc/libmasm/module: Fix two use after free in ibmasm_init_one

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc/libmasm/module: Fix two use after free in ibmasm_init_one

In ibmasm_init_one, it calls ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev().
Inside ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev, mouse_dev and keybd_dev are
allocated by input_allocate_device(), and assigned to
sp->remote.mouse_dev and sp->remote.keybd_dev respectively.

In the err_free_devices error branch of ibmasm_init_one,
mouse_dev and keybd_dev are freed by input_free_device(), and return
error. Then the execution runs into error_send_message error branch
of ibmasm_init_one, where ibmasm_free_remote_input_dev(sp) is called
to unregister the freed sp->remote.mouse_dev and sp->remote.keybd_dev.

My patch add a "error_init_remote" label to handle the error of
ibmasm_init_remote_input_dev(), to avoid the uaf bugs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47334 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
