Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uio_hv_generic: Fix another memory leak in error handling paths

function is never freed in the error handling path.

Add the missing 'vmbus_free_ring()' call.

Note that it is already freed in the .remove function.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
