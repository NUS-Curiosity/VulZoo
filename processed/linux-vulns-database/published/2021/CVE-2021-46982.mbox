Subject: CVE-2021-46982: f2fs: compress: fix race condition of overwrite vs truncate

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: compress: fix race condition of overwrite vs truncate

pos_fsstress testcase complains a panic as belew:

------------[ cut here ]------------
kernel BUG at fs/f2fs/compress.c:1082!
invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
CPU: 4 PID: 2753477 Comm: kworker/u16:2 Tainted: G           OE     5.12.0-rc1-custom #1
Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-2 04/01/2014

The root cause is truncate() may race with overwrite as below,
so that one reference count left in page can not guarantee the
page attaching in mapping tree all the time, after truncation,
later find_lock_page() may return NULL pointer.

- prepare_compress_overwrite
 - f2fs_pagecache_get_page
 - unlock_page
					- f2fs_setattr
					 - truncate_setsize
					  - truncate_inode_page
					   - delete_from_page_cache
 - find_lock_page

Fix this by avoiding referencing updated page.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46982 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
