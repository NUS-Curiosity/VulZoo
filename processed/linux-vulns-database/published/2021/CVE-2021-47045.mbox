Subject: CVE-2021-47045: scsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference in lpfc_prep_els_iocb()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference in lpfc_prep_els_iocb()

It is possible to call lpfc_issue_els_plogi() passing a did for which no
matching ndlp is found. A call is then made to lpfc_prep_els_iocb() with a
null pointer to a lpfc_nodelist structure resulting in a null pointer
dereference.

Fix by returning an error status if no valid ndlp is found. Fix up comments
regarding ndlp reference counting.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47045 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a09677de458d500b00701f6036baa423d9995408
