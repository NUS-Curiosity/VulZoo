Subject: CVE-2021-47073: platform/x86: dell-smbios-wmi: Fix oops on rmmod dell_smbios

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: dell-smbios-wmi: Fix oops on rmmod dell_smbios

init_dell_smbios_wmi() only registers the dell_smbios_wmi_driver on systems
where the Dell WMI interface is supported. While exit_dell_smbios_wmi()
unregisters it unconditionally, this leads to the following oops:

[  175.722921] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[  175.722925] Unexpected driver unregister!
[  175.722939] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3630 at drivers/base/driver.c:194 driver_unregister+0x38/0x40
...
[  175.723089] Call Trace:
[  175.723094]  cleanup_module+0x5/0xedd [dell_smbios]
...
[  175.723148] ---[ end trace 064c34e1ad49509d ]---

Make the unregister happen on the same condition the register happens
to fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47073 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
