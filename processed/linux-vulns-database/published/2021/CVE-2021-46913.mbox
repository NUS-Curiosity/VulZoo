Subject: CVE-2021-46913: netfilter: nftables: clone set element expression template

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nftables: clone set element expression template

memcpy() breaks when using connlimit in set elements. Use
nft_expr_clone() to initialize the connlimit expression list, otherwise
connlimit garbage collector crashes when walking on the list head copy.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e51ff3ffc316377cca21de8b80404eed0c37b3c3
