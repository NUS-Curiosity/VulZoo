Subject: CVE-2021-47333: misc: alcor_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridge

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: alcor_pci: fix null-ptr-deref when there is no PCI bridge

There is an issue with the ASPM(optional) capability checking function.
A device might be attached to root complex directly, in this case,
bus->self(bridge) will be NULL, thus priv->parent_pdev is NULL.
Since alcor_pci_init_check_aspm(priv->parent_pdev) checks the PCI link's
ASPM capability and populate parent_cap_off, which will be used later by
alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() to dynamically turn on/off device, what we can do
here is to avoid checking the capability if we are on the root complex.
This will make pdev_cap_off 0 and alcor_pci_aspm_ctrl() will simply
return when bring called, effectively disable ASPM for the device.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
