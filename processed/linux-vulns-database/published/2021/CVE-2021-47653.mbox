Subject: CVE-2021-47653: media: davinci: vpif: fix use-after-free on driver unbind

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: davinci: vpif: fix use-after-free on driver unbind

The driver allocates and registers two platform device structures during
probe, but the devices were never deregistered on driver unbind.

This results in a use-after-free on driver unbind as the device
structures were allocated using devres and would be freed by driver
core when remove() returns.

Fix this by adding the missing deregistration calls to the remove()
callback and failing probe on registration errors.

Note that the platform device structures must be freed using a proper
release callback to avoid leaking associated resources like device
names.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47653 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
