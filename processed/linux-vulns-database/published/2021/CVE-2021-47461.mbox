Subject: CVE-2021-47461: userfaultfd: fix a race between writeprotect and exit_mmap()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

userfaultfd: fix a race between writeprotect and exit_mmap()

A race is possible when a process exits, its VMAs are removed by
exit_mmap() and at the same time userfaultfd_writeprotect() is called.

The race was detected by KASAN on a development kernel, but it appears
to be possible on vanilla kernels as well.

Use mmget_not_zero() to prevent the race as done in other userfaultfd
operations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47461 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
