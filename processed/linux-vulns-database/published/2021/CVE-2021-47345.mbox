Subject: CVE-2021-47345: RDMA/cma: Fix rdma_resolve_route() memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/cma: Fix rdma_resolve_route() memory leak

Fix a memory leak when "mda_resolve_route() is called more than once on
the same "rdma_cm_id".

This is possible if cma_query_handler() triggers the
RDMA_CM_EVENT_ROUTE_ERROR flow which puts the state machine back and
allows rdma_resolve_route() to be called again.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47345 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
