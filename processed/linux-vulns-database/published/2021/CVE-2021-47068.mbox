Subject: CVE-2021-47068: net/nfc: fix use-after-free llcp_sock_bind/connect

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/nfc: fix use-after-free llcp_sock_bind/connect

Commits 8a4cd82d ("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect()")
and c33b1cc62 ("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind()")
fixed a refcount leak bug in bind/connect but introduced a
use-after-free if the same local is assigned to 2 different sockets.

This can be triggered by the following simple program:
    int sock1 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
    int sock2 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM, NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP );
    memset( &addr, 0, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) );
    addr.sa_family = AF_NFC;
    addr.nfc_protocol = NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP;
    bind( sock1, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
    bind( sock2, (struct sockaddr*) &addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) )
    close(sock1);
    close(sock2);

Fix this by assigning NULL to llcp_sock->local after calling
nfc_llcp_local_put.

This addresses CVE-2021-23134.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47068 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
