Subject: CVE-2021-47355: atm: nicstar: Fix possible use-after-free in nicstar_cleanup()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

atm: nicstar: Fix possible use-after-free in nicstar_cleanup()

This module's remove path calls del_timer(). However, that function
does not wait until the timer handler finishes. This means that the
timer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function
has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.

Fix by calling del_timer_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler
has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47355 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
