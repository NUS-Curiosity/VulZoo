Subject: CVE-2021-47657: drm/virtio: Ensure that objs is not NULL in virtio_gpu_array_put_free()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/virtio: Ensure that objs is not NULL in virtio_gpu_array_put_free()

If virtio_gpu_object_shmem_init() fails (e.g. due to fault injection, as it
happened in the bug report by syzbot), virtio_gpu_array_put_free() could be
called with objs equal to NULL.

Ensure that objs is not NULL in virtio_gpu_array_put_free(), or otherwise
return from the function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47657 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
