Subject: CVE-2021-47457: can: isotp: isotp_sendmsg(): add result check for wait_event_interruptible()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: isotp: isotp_sendmsg(): add result check for wait_event_interruptible()

Using wait_event_interruptible() to wait for complete transmission,
but do not check the result of wait_event_interruptible() which can be
interrupted. It will result in TX buffer has multiple accessors and
the later process interferes with the previous process.

Following is one of the problems reported by syzbot.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
