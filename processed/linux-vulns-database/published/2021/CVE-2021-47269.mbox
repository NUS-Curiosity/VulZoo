Subject: CVE-2021-47269: usb: dwc3: ep0: fix NULL pointer exception

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: ep0: fix NULL pointer exception

There is no validation of the index from dwc3_wIndex_to_dep() and we might
be referring a non-existing ep and trigger a NULL pointer exception. In
certain configurations we might use fewer eps and the index might wrongly
indicate a larger ep index than existing.

By adding this validation from the patch we can actually report a wrong
index back to the caller.

In our usecase we are using a composite device on an older kernel, but
upstream might use this fix also. Unfortunately, I cannot describe the
hardware for others to reproduce the issue as it is a proprietary
implementation.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
