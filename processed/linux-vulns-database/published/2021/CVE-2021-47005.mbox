Subject: CVE-2021-47005: PCI: endpoint: Fix NULL pointer dereference for ->get_features()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: endpoint: Fix NULL pointer dereference for ->get_features()

get_features ops of pci_epc_ops may return NULL, causing NULL pointer
dereference in pci_epf_test_alloc_space function. Let us add a check for
pci_epc_feature pointer in pci_epf_test_bind before we access it to avoid
any such NULL pointer dereference and return -ENOTSUPP in case
pci_epc_feature is not found.

When the patch is not applied and EPC features is not implemented in the
platform driver, we see the following dump due to kernel NULL pointer
dereference.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
