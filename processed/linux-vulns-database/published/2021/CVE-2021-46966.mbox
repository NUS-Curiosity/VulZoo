Subject: CVE-2021-46966: ACPI: custom_method: fix potential use-after-free issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: custom_method: fix potential use-after-free issue

In cm_write(), buf is always freed when reaching the end of the
function.  If the requested count is less than table.length, the
allocated buffer will be freed but subsequent calls to cm_write() will
still try to access it.

Remove the unconditional kfree(buf) at the end of the function and
set the buf to NULL in the -EINVAL error path to match the rest of
function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46966 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
