Subject: CVE-2021-47364: comedi: Fix memory leak in compat_insnlist()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Fix memory leak in compat_insnlist()

`compat_insnlist()` handles the 32-bit version of the `COMEDI_INSNLIST`
ioctl (whenwhen `CONFIG_COMPAT` is enabled).  It allocates memory to
temporarily hold an array of `struct comedi_insn` converted from the
32-bit version in user space.  This memory is only being freed if there
is a fault while filling the array, otherwise it is leaked.

Add a call to `kfree()` to fix the leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47364 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d6a21e4cd6a319b0662cbe4ad6199e276ac776a
