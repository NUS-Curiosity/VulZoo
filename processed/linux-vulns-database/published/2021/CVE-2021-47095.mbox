Subject: CVE-2021-47095: ipmi: ssif: initialize ssif_info->client early

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipmi: ssif: initialize ssif_info->client early

During probe ssif_info->client is dereferenced in error path. However,
it is set when some of the error checking has already been done. This
causes following kernel crash if an error path is taken:

[   30.645593][  T674] ipmi_ssif 0-000e: ipmi_ssif: Not probing, Interface already present
[   30.657616][  T674] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000088
...
[   30.657723][  T674] pc : __dev_printk+0x28/0xa0
[   30.657732][  T674] lr : _dev_err+0x7c/0xa0
...
[   30.657772][  T674] Call trace:
[   30.657775][  T674]  __dev_printk+0x28/0xa0
[   30.657778][  T674]  _dev_err+0x7c/0xa0
[   30.657781][  T674]  ssif_probe+0x548/0x900 [ipmi_ssif 62ce4b08badc1458fd896206d9ef69a3c31f3d3e]
[   30.657791][  T674]  i2c_device_probe+0x37c/0x3c0
...

Initialize ssif_info->client before any error path can be taken. Clear
i2c_client data in the error path to prevent the dangling pointer from
leaking.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47095 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
