Subject: CVE-2021-46948: sfc: farch: fix TX queue lookup in TX event handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sfc: farch: fix TX queue lookup in TX event handling

We're starting from a TXQ label, not a TXQ type, so
 efx_channel_get_tx_queue() is inappropriate (and could return NULL,
 leading to panics).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46948 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
