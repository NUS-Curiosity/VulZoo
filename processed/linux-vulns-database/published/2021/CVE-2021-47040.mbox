Subject: CVE-2021-47040: io_uring: fix overflows checks in provide buffers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix overflows checks in provide buffers

Colin reported before possible overflow and sign extension problems in
io_provide_buffers_prep(). As Linus pointed out previous attempt did nothing
useful, see d81269fecb8ce ("io_uring: fix provide_buffers sign extension").

Do that with help of check_<op>_overflow helpers. And fix struct
io_provide_buf::len type, as it doesn't make much sense to keep it
signed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47040 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
