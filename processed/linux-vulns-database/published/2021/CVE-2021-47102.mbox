Subject: CVE-2021-47102: net: marvell: prestera: fix incorrect structure access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: marvell: prestera: fix incorrect structure access

In line:
	upper = info->upper_dev;
We access upper_dev field, which is related only for particular events
(e.g. event == NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER). So, this line cause invalid memory
access for another events,
when ptr is not netdev_notifier_changeupper_info.

The KASAN logs are as follows:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
