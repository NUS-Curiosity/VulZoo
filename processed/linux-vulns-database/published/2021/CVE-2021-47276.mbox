Subject: CVE-2021-47276: ftrace: Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace_bug()

It was reported that a bug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used for
updating into a nop in ftrace_init(), but the error path (rightfully)
returned -EINVAL and not -EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to
occur. But because -EINVAL was returned, the ftrace_bug() tried to report
what was at the location of the ip address, and read it directly. This
caused the machine to panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memory
address.

Instead, read the ip address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() to safely
access the memory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted,
otherwise report what was in that location.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47276 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
