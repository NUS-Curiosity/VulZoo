Subject: CVE-2021-47638: ubifs: rename_whiteout: Fix double free for whiteout_ui->data

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: rename_whiteout: Fix double free for whiteout_ui->data

'whiteout_ui->data' will be freed twice if space budget fail for
rename whiteout operation as following process:

rename_whiteout
  dev = kmalloc
  whiteout_ui->data = dev
  kfree(whiteout_ui->data)  // Free first time
  iput(whiteout)
    ubifs_free_inode
      kfree(ui->data)	    // Double free!

KASAN reports:

BUG: KASAN: double-free or invalid-free in ubifs_free_inode+0x4f/0x70

The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff88810238bed8 which
belongs to the cache kmalloc-8 of size 8
==================================================================

Let ubifs_free_inode() free 'whiteout_ui->data'. BTW, delete unused
assignment 'whiteout_ui->data_len = 0', process 'ubifs_evict_inode()
-> ubifs_jnl_delete_inode() -> ubifs_jnl_write_inode()' doesn't need it
(because 'inc_nlink(whiteout)' won't be excuted by 'goto out_release',
 and the nlink of whiteout inode is 0).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47638 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
