Subject: CVE-2021-46954: net/sched: sch_frag: fix stack OOB read while fragmenting IPv4 packets

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: sch_frag: fix stack OOB read while fragmenting IPv4 packets

when 'act_mirred' tries to fragment IPv4 packets that had been previously
re-assembled using 'act_ct', splats like the following can be observed on
kernels built with KASAN:

for IPv4 packets, sch_fragment() uses a temporary struct dst_entry. Then,
in the following call graph:

  ip_do_fragment()
    ip_skb_dst_mtu()
      ip_dst_mtu_maybe_forward()
        ip_mtu_locked()

the pointer to struct dst_entry is used as pointer to struct rtable: this
turns the access to struct members like rt_mtu_locked into an OOB read in
the stack. Fix this changing the temporary variable used for IPv4 packets
in sch_fragment(), similarly to what is done for IPv6 few lines below.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46954 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/018bb8da5b5888e19585f9b802f036afe643fcef
