Subject: CVE-2021-47218: selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

selinux: fix NULL-pointer dereference when hashtab allocation fails

When the hash table slot array allocation fails in hashtab_init(),
h->size is left initialized with a non-zero value, but the h->htable
pointer is NULL. This may then cause a NULL pointer dereference, since
the policydb code relies on the assumption that even after a failed
hashtab_init(), hashtab_map() and hashtab_destroy() can be safely called
on it. Yet, these detect an empty hashtab only by looking at the size.

Fix this by making sure that hashtab_init() always leaves behind a valid
empty hashtab when the allocation fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47218 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b17dd53cac769dd13031b0ca34f90cc65e523fab
