Subject: CVE-2021-47475: comedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: vmk80xx: fix transfer-buffer overflows

The driver uses endpoint-sized USB transfer buffers but up until
recently had no sanity checks on the sizes.

Commit e1f13c879a7c ("staging: comedi: check validity of wMaxPacketSize
of usb endpoints found") inadvertently fixed NULL-pointer dereferences
when accessing the transfer buffers in case a malicious device has a
zero wMaxPacketSize.

Make sure to allocate buffers large enough to handle also the other
accesses that are done without a size check (e.g. byte 18 in
vmk80xx_cnt_insn_read() for the VMK8061_MODEL) to avoid writing beyond
the buffers, for example, when doing descriptor fuzzing.

The original driver was for a low-speed device with 8-byte buffers.
Support was later added for a device that uses bulk transfers and is
presumably a full-speed device with a maximum 64-byte wMaxPacketSize.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47475 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
