Subject: CVE-2021-47652: video: fbdev: smscufx: Fix null-ptr-deref in ufx_usb_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

video: fbdev: smscufx: Fix null-ptr-deref in ufx_usb_probe()

I got a null-ptr-deref report:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
...
RIP: 0010:fb_destroy_modelist+0x38/0x100
...
Call Trace:
 ufx_usb_probe.cold+0x2b5/0xac1 [smscufx]
 usb_probe_interface+0x1aa/0x3c0 [usbcore]
 really_probe+0x167/0x460
...
 ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30

If fb_alloc_cmap() fails in ufx_usb_probe(), fb_destroy_modelist() will
be called to destroy modelist in the error handling path. But modelist
has not been initialized yet, so it will result in null-ptr-deref.

Initialize modelist before calling fb_alloc_cmap() to fix this bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47652 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
