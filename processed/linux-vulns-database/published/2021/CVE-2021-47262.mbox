Subject: CVE-2021-47262: KVM: x86: Ensure liveliness of nested VM-Enter fail tracepoint message

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Ensure liveliness of nested VM-Enter fail tracepoint message

Use the __string() machinery provided by the tracing subystem to make a
copy of the string literals consumed by the "nested VM-Enter failed"
tracepoint.  A complete copy is necessary to ensure that the tracepoint
can't outlive the data/memory it consumes and deference stale memory.

Because the tracepoint itself is defined by kvm, if kvm-intel and/or
kvm-amd are built as modules, the memory holding the string literals
defined by the vendor modules will be freed when the module is unloaded,
whereas the tracepoint and its data in the ring buffer will live until
kvm is unloaded (or "indefinitely" if kvm is built-in).

This bug has existed since the tracepoint was added, but was recently
exposed by a new check in tracing to detect exactly this type of bug.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
