Subject: CVE-2021-47560: mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware

When processing port up/down events generated by the device's firmware,
the driver protects itself from events reported for non-existent local
ports, but not the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but lacks a
netdev.

This can result in a NULL pointer dereference when calling
netif_carrier_{on,off}().

Fix this by bailing early when processing an event reported for the CPU
port. Problem was only observed when running on top of a buggy emulator.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47560 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
