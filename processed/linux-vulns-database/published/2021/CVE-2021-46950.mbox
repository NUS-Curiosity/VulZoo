Subject: CVE-2021-46950: md/raid1: properly indicate failure when ending a failed write request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid1: properly indicate failure when ending a failed write request

This patch addresses a data corruption bug in raid1 arrays using bitmaps.
Without this fix, the bitmap bits for the failed I/O end up being cleared.

Since we are in the failure leg of raid1_end_write_request, the request
either needs to be retried (R1BIO_WriteError) or failed (R1BIO_Degraded).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46950 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
