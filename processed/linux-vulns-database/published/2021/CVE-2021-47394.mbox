Subject: CVE-2021-47394: netfilter: nf_tables: unlink table before deleting it

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: unlink table before deleting it

syzbot reports following UAF:
BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in memcmp+0x18f/0x1c0 lib/string.c:955
 nla_strcmp+0xf2/0x130 lib/nlattr.c:836
 nft_table_lookup.part.0+0x1a2/0x460 net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:570
 nft_table_lookup net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:4064 [inline]
 nf_tables_getset+0x1b3/0x860 net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:4064
 nfnetlink_rcv_msg+0x659/0x13f0 net/netfilter/nfnetlink.c:285
 netlink_rcv_skb+0x153/0x420 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2504

Problem is that all get operations are lockless, so the commit_mutex
held by nft_rcv_nl_event() isn't enough to stop a parallel GET request
from doing read-accesses to the table object even after synchronize_rcu().

To avoid this, unlink the table first and store the table objects in
on-stack scratch space.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47394 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f65c73d3aabb87d4353e0bc4a718b5ae8c43fd04
