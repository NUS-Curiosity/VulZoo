Subject: CVE-2021-47007: f2fs: fix panic during f2fs_resize_fs()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix panic during f2fs_resize_fs()

f2fs_resize_fs() hangs in below callstack with testcase:
- mkfs 16GB image & mount image
- dd 8GB fileA
- dd 8GB fileB
- sync
- rm fileA
- sync
- resize filesystem to 8GB

kernel BUG at segment.c:2484!
Call Trace:

The root cause is we forgot to check that whether we have enough space
in resized filesystem to store all valid blocks in before-resizing
filesystem, then allocator will run out-of-space during block migration
in free_segment_range().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47007 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
