Subject: CVE-2021-47392: RDMA/cma: Fix listener leak in rdma_cma_listen_on_all() failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/cma: Fix listener leak in rdma_cma_listen_on_all() failure

If cma_listen_on_all() fails it leaves the per-device ID still on the
listen_list but the state is not set to RDMA_CM_ADDR_BOUND.

When the cmid is eventually destroyed cma_cancel_listens() is not called
due to the wrong state, however the per-device IDs are still holding the
refcount preventing the ID from being destroyed, thus deadlocking:

 task:rping state:D stack:   0 pid:19605 ppid: 47036 flags:0x00000084

Ensure that cma_listen_on_all() atomically unwinds its action under the
lock during error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47392 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3f4e68902d2e545033c80d7ad62fd9a439e573f4
