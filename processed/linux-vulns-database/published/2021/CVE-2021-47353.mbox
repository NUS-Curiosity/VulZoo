Subject: CVE-2021-47353: udf: Fix NULL pointer dereference in udf_symlink function

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udf: Fix NULL pointer dereference in udf_symlink function

In function udf_symlink, epos.bh is assigned with the value returned
by udf_tgetblk. The function udf_tgetblk is defined in udf/misc.c
and returns the value of sb_getblk function that could be NULL.
Then, epos.bh is used without any check, causing a possible
NULL pointer dereference when sb_getblk fails.

This fix adds a check to validate the value of epos.bh.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47353 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
