Subject: CVE-2021-47240: net: qrtr: fix OOB Read in qrtr_endpoint_post

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: qrtr: fix OOB Read in qrtr_endpoint_post

Syzbot reported slab-out-of-bounds Read in
qrtr_endpoint_post. The problem was in wrong
_size_ type:

	if (len != ALIGN(size, 4) + hdrlen)
		goto err;

If size from qrtr_hdr is 4294967293 (0xfffffffd), the result of
ALIGN(size, 4) will be 0. In case of len == hdrlen and size == 4294967293
in header this check won't fail and

	skb_put_data(skb, data + hdrlen, size);

will read out of bound from data, which is hdrlen allocated block.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47240 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
