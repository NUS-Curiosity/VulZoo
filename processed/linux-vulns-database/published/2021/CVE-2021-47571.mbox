Subject: CVE-2021-47571: staging: rtl8192e: Fix use after free in _rtl92e_pci_disconnect()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: rtl8192e: Fix use after free in _rtl92e_pci_disconnect()

The free_rtllib() function frees the "dev" pointer so there is use
after free on the next line.  Re-arrange things to avoid that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47571 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
