Subject: CVE-2021-47358: staging: greybus: uart: fix tty use after free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: greybus: uart: fix tty use after free

User space can hold a tty open indefinitely and tty drivers must not
release the underlying structures until the last user is gone.

Switch to using the tty-port reference counter to manage the life time
of the greybus tty state to avoid use after free after a disconnect.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47358 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
