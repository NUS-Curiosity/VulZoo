Subject: CVE-2021-46956: virtiofs: fix memory leak in virtio_fs_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtiofs: fix memory leak in virtio_fs_probe()

When accidentally passing twice the same tag to qemu, kmemleak ended up
reporting a memory leak in virtiofs.  Also, looking at the log I saw the
following error (that's when I realised the duplicated tag):

  virtiofs: probe of virtio5 failed with error -17

Here's the kmemleak log for reference:

unreferenced object 0xffff888103d47800 (size 1024):

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
