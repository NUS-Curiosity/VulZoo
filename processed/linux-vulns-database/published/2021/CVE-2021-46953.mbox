Subject: CVE-2021-46953: ACPI: GTDT: Don't corrupt interrupt mappings on watchdow probe failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: GTDT: Don't corrupt interrupt mappings on watchdow probe failure

When failing the driver probe because of invalid firmware properties,
the GTDT driver unmaps the interrupt that it mapped earlier.

However, it never checks whether the mapping of the interrupt actially
succeeded. Even more, should the firmware report an illegal interrupt
number that overlaps with the GIC SGI range, this can result in an
IPI being unmapped, and subsequent fireworks (as reported by Dann
Frazier).

Rework the driver to have a slightly saner behaviour and actually
check whether the interrupt has been mapped before unmapping things.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46953 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
