Subject: CVE-2021-47132: mptcp: fix sk_forward_memory corruption on retransmission

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix sk_forward_memory corruption on retransmission

MPTCP sk_forward_memory handling is a bit special, as such field
is protected by the msk socket spin_lock, instead of the plain
socket lock.

Currently we have a code path updating such field without handling
the relevant lock:

__mptcp_retrans() -> __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup()

Several helpers in __mptcp_clean_una_wakeup() will update
sk_forward_alloc, possibly causing such field corruption, as reported
by Matthieu.

Address the issue providing and using a new variant of blamed function
which explicitly acquires the msk spin lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47132 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
