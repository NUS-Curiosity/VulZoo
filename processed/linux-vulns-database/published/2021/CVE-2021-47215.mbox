Subject: CVE-2021-47215: net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix crash in RX resync flow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix crash in RX resync flow

For the TLS RX resync flow, we maintain a list of TLS contexts
that require some attention, to communicate their resync information
to the HW.
Here we fix list corruptions, by protecting the entries against
movements coming from resync_handle_seq_match(), until their resync
handling in napi is fully completed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47215 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ebeda7a9528ae690e6bf12791a868f0cca8391f2
