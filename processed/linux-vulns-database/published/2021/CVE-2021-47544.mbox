Subject: CVE-2021-47544: tcp: fix page frag corruption on page fault

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: fix page frag corruption on page fault

Steffen reported a TCP stream corruption for HTTP requests
served by the apache web-server using a cifs mount-point
and memory mapping the relevant file.

The root cause is quite similar to the one addressed by
commit 20eb4f29b602 ("net: fix sk_page_frag() recursion from
memory reclaim"). Here the nested access to the task page frag
is caused by a page fault on the (mmapped) user-space memory
buffer coming from the cifs file.

The page fault handler performs an smb transaction on a different
socket, inside the same process context. Since sk->sk_allaction
for such socket does not prevent the usage for the task_frag,
the nested allocation modify "under the hood" the page frag
in use by the outer sendmsg call, corrupting the stream.

The overall relevant stack trace looks like the following:

The cifs filesystem rightfully sets sk_allocations to GFP_NOFS,
we can avoid the nesting using the sk page frag for allocation
lacking the __GFP_FS flag. Do not define an additional mm-helper
for that, as this is strictly tied to the sk page frag usage.

v1 -> v2:
 - use a stricted sk_page_frag() check instead of reordering the
   code (Eric)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47544 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c6f340a331fb72e5ac23a083de9c780e132ca3ae
