Subject: CVE-2021-47093: platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: fix memleak on registration failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: fix memleak on registration failure

In case device registration fails during module initialisation, the
platform device structure needs to be freed using platform_device_put()
to properly free all resources (e.g. the device name).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47093 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
