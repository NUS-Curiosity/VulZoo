Subject: CVE-2021-47023: net: marvell: prestera: fix port event handling on init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: marvell: prestera: fix port event handling on init

For some reason there might be a crash during ports creation if port
events are handling at the same time  because fw may send initial
port event with down state.

The crash points to cancel_delayed_work() which is called when port went
is down.  Currently I did not find out the real cause of the issue, so
fixed it by cancel port stats work only if previous port's state was up
& runnig.

The following is the crash which can be triggered:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
