Subject: CVE-2021-47361: mcb: fix error handling in mcb_alloc_bus()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mcb: fix error handling in mcb_alloc_bus()

There are two bugs:
1) If ida_simple_get() fails then this code calls put_device(carrier)
   but we haven't yet called get_device(carrier) and probably that
   leads to a use after free.
2) After device_initialize() then we need to use put_device() to
   release the bus.  This will free the internal resources tied to the
   device and call mcb_free_bus() which will free the rest.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47361 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
