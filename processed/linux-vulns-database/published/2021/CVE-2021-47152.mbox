Subject: CVE-2021-47152: mptcp: fix data stream corruption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix data stream corruption

Maxim reported several issues when forcing a TCP transparent proxy
to use the MPTCP protocol for the inbound connections. He also
provided a clean reproducer.

The problem boils down to 'mptcp_frag_can_collapse_to()' assuming
that only MPTCP will use the given page_frag.

If others - e.g. the plain TCP protocol - allocate page fragments,
we can end-up re-using already allocated memory for mptcp_data_frag.

Fix the issue ensuring that the to-be-expanded data fragment is
located at the current page frag end.

v1 -> v2:
 - added missing fixes tag (Mat)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47152 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
