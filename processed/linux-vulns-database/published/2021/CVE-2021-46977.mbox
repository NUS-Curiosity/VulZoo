Subject: CVE-2021-46977: KVM: VMX: Disable preemption when probing user return MSRs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: VMX: Disable preemption when probing user return MSRs

Disable preemption when probing a user return MSR via RDSMR/WRMSR.  If
the MSR holds a different value per logical CPU, the WRMSR could corrupt
the host's value if KVM is preempted between the RDMSR and WRMSR, and
then rescheduled on a different CPU.

Opportunistically land the helper in common x86, SVM will use the helper
in a future commit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46977 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
