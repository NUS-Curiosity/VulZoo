Subject: CVE-2021-47375: blktrace: Fix uaf in blk_trace access after removing by sysfs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blktrace: Fix uaf in blk_trace access after removing by sysfs

There is an use-after-free problem triggered by following process:

      P1(sda)				P2(sdb)
			echo 0 > /sys/block/sdb/trace/enable
			  blk_trace_remove_queue
			    synchronize_rcu
			    blk_trace_free
			      relay_close
rcu_read_lock
__blk_add_trace
  trace_note_tsk
  (Iterate running_trace_list)
			        relay_close_buf
				  relay_destroy_buf
				    kfree(buf)
    trace_note(sdb's bt)
      relay_reserve
        buf->offset <- nullptr deference (use-after-free) !!!
rcu_read_unlock

Reproduce method:
  ioctl(/dev/sda, BLKTRACESETUP, blk_user_trace_setup[buf_size=127])
  ioctl(/dev/sda, BLKTRACESTART)
  ioctl(/dev/sdb, BLKTRACESETUP, blk_user_trace_setup[buf_size=127])
  ioctl(/dev/sdb, BLKTRACESTART)

  echo 0 > /sys/block/sdb/trace/enable &
  // Add delay(mdelay/msleep) before kernel enters blk_trace_free()

  ioctl$SG_IO(/dev/sda, SG_IO, ...)
  // Enters trace_note_tsk() after blk_trace_free() returned
  // Use mdelay in rcu region rather than msleep(which may schedule out)

Remove blk_trace from running_list before calling blk_trace_free() by
sysfs if blk_trace is at Blktrace_running state.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47375 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
