Subject: CVE-2021-47368: enetc: Fix illegal access when reading affinity_hint

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

enetc: Fix illegal access when reading affinity_hint

irq_set_affinity_hit() stores a reference to the cpumask_t
parameter in the irq descriptor, and that reference can be
accessed later from irq_affinity_hint_proc_show(). Since
the cpu_mask parameter passed to irq_set_affinity_hit() has
only temporary storage (it's on the stack memory), later
accesses to it are illegal. Thus reads from the corresponding
procfs affinity_hint file can result in paging request oops.

The issue is fixed by the get_cpu_mask() helper, which provides
a permanent storage for the cpumask_t parameter.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47368 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
