Subject: CVE-2021-47372: net: macb: fix use after free on rmmod

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: macb: fix use after free on rmmod

plat_dev->dev->platform_data is released by platform_device_unregister(),
use of pclk and hclk is a use-after-free. Since device unregister won't
need a clk device we adjust the function call sequence to fix this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
