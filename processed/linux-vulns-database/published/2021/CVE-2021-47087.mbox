Subject: CVE-2021-47087: tee: optee: Fix incorrect page free bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tee: optee: Fix incorrect page free bug

Pointer to the allocated pages (struct page *page) has already
progressed towards the end of allocation. It is incorrect to perform
__free_pages(page, order) using this pointer as we would free any
arbitrary pages. Fix this by stop modifying the page pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47087 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
