Subject: CVE-2021-46922: KEYS: trusted: Fix TPM reservation for seal/unseal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KEYS: trusted: Fix TPM reservation for seal/unseal

The original patch 8c657a0590de ("KEYS: trusted: Reserve TPM for seal
and unseal operations") was correct on the mailing list:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20210128235621.127925-4-jarkko@kernel.org/

But somehow got rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() in
tpm2_seal_trusted() got lost.  This causes an imbalanced put of the
TPM ops and causes oopses on TIS based hardware.

This fix puts back the lost tpm_try_get_ops()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46922 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
