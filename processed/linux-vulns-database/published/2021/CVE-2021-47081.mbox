Subject: CVE-2021-47081: habanalabs/gaudi: Fix a potential use after free in gaudi_memset_device_memory

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

habanalabs/gaudi: Fix a potential use after free in gaudi_memset_device_memory

Our code analyzer reported a uaf.

In gaudi_memset_device_memory, cb is get via hl_cb_kernel_create()
with 2 refcount.
If hl_cs_allocate_job() failed, the execution runs into release_cb
branch. One ref of cb is dropped by hl_cb_put(cb) and could be freed
if other thread also drops one ref. Then cb is used by cb->id later,
which is a potential uaf.

My patch add a variable 'id' to accept the value of cb->id before the
hl_cb_put(cb) is called, to avoid the potential uaf.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47081 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
