Subject: CVE-2021-47454: powerpc/smp: do not decrement idle task preempt count in CPU offline

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/smp: do not decrement idle task preempt count in CPU offline

With PREEMPT_COUNT=y, when a CPU is offlined and then onlined again, we
get:

BUG: scheduling while atomic: swapper/1/0/0x00000000
no locks held by swapper/1/0.
CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 5.15.0-rc2+ #100
Call Trace:
 dump_stack_lvl+0xac/0x108
 __schedule_bug+0xac/0xe0
 __schedule+0xcf8/0x10d0
 schedule_idle+0x3c/0x70
 do_idle+0x2d8/0x4a0
 cpu_startup_entry+0x38/0x40
 start_secondary+0x2ec/0x3a0
 start_secondary_prolog+0x10/0x14

This is because powerpc's arch_cpu_idle_dead() decrements the idle task's
preempt count, for reasons explained in commit a7c2bb8279d2 ("powerpc:
Re-enable preemption before cpu_die()"), specifically "start_secondary()
expects a preempt_count() of 0."

However, since commit 2c669ef6979c ("powerpc/preempt: Don't touch the idle
task's preempt_count during hotplug") and commit f1a0a376ca0c ("sched/core:
Initialize the idle task with preemption disabled"), that justification no
longer holds.

The idle task isn't supposed to re-enable preemption, so remove the
vestigial preempt_enable() from the CPU offline path.

Tested with pseries and powernv in qemu, and pseries on PowerVM.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47454 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
