Subject: CVE-2021-47567: powerpc/32: Fix hardlockup on vmap stack overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/32: Fix hardlockup on vmap stack overflow

Since the commit c118c7303ad5 ("powerpc/32: Fix vmap stack - Do not
activate MMU before reading task struct") a vmap stack overflow
results in a hard lockup. This is because emergency_ctx is still
addressed with its virtual address allthough data MMU is not active
anymore at that time.

Fix it by using a physical address instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47567 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
