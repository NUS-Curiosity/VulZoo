Subject: CVE-2021-47009: KEYS: trusted: Fix memory leak on object td

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KEYS: trusted: Fix memory leak on object td

Two error return paths are neglecting to free allocated object td,
causing a memory leak. Fix this by returning via the error return
path that securely kfree's td.

Fixes clang scan-build warning:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
