Subject: CVE-2021-47503: scsi: pm80xx: Do not call scsi_remove_host() in pm8001_alloc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm80xx: Do not call scsi_remove_host() in pm8001_alloc()

Calling scsi_remove_host() before scsi_add_host() results in a crash:

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000108
 RIP: 0010:device_del+0x63/0x440
 Call Trace:
  device_unregister+0x17/0x60
  scsi_remove_host+0xee/0x2a0
  pm8001_pci_probe+0x6ef/0x1b90 [pm80xx]
  local_pci_probe+0x3f/0x90

We cannot call scsi_remove_host() in pm8001_alloc() because scsi_add_host()
has not been called yet at that point in time.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
