Subject: CVE-2021-47063: drm: bridge/panel: Cleanup connector on bridge detach

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: bridge/panel: Cleanup connector on bridge detach

If we don't call drm_connector_cleanup() manually in
panel_bridge_detach(), the connector will be cleaned up with the other
DRM objects in the call to drm_mode_config_cleanup(). However, since our
drm_connector is devm-allocated, by the time drm_mode_config_cleanup()
will be called, our connector will be long gone. Therefore, the
connector must be cleaned up when the bridge is detached to avoid
use-after-free conditions.

v2: Cleanup connector only if it was created

v3: Add FIXME

v4: (Use connector->dev) directly in if() block

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47063 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
