Subject: CVE-2021-47176: s390/dasd: add missing discipline function

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/dasd: add missing discipline function

Fix crash with illegal operation exception in dasd_device_tasklet.
Commit b72949328869 ("s390/dasd: Prepare for additional path event handling")
renamed the verify_path function for ECKD but not for FBA and DIAG.
This leads to a panic when the path verification function is called for a
FBA or DIAG device.

Fix by defining a wrapper function for dasd_generic_verify_path().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47176 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
