Subject: CVE-2021-47424: i40e: Fix freeing of uninitialized misc IRQ vector

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: Fix freeing of uninitialized misc IRQ vector

When VSI set up failed in i40e_probe() as part of PF switch set up
driver was trying to free misc IRQ vectors in
i40e_clear_interrupt_scheme and produced a kernel Oops:

   Trying to free already-free IRQ 266
   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5 at kernel/irq/manage.c:1731 __free_irq+0x9a/0x300

The problem is that at that point misc IRQ vectors
were not allocated yet and we get a call trace
that driver is trying to free already free IRQ vectors.

Add a check in i40e_clear_interrupt_scheme for __I40E_MISC_IRQ_REQUESTED
PF state before calling i40e_free_misc_vector. This state is set only if
misc IRQ vectors were properly initialized.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47424 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
