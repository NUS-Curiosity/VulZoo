Subject: CVE-2021-47297: net: fix uninit-value in caif_seqpkt_sendmsg

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix uninit-value in caif_seqpkt_sendmsg

When nr_segs equal to zero in iovec_from_user, the object
msg->msg_iter.iov is uninit stack memory in caif_seqpkt_sendmsg
which is defined in ___sys_sendmsg. So we cann't just judge
msg->msg_iter.iov->base directlly. We can use nr_segs to judge
msg in caif_seqpkt_sendmsg whether has data buffers.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
