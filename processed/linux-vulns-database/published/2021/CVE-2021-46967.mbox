Subject: CVE-2021-46967: vhost-vdpa: fix vm_flags for virtqueue doorbell mapping

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vhost-vdpa: fix vm_flags for virtqueue doorbell mapping

The virtqueue doorbell is usually implemented via registeres but we
don't provide the necessary vma->flags like VM_PFNMAP. This may cause
several issues e.g when userspace tries to map the doorbell via vhost
IOTLB, kernel may panic due to the page is not backed by page
structure. This patch fixes this by setting the necessary
vm_flags. With this patch, try to map doorbell via IOTLB will fail
with bad address.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46967 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
