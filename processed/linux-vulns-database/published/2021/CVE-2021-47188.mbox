Subject: CVE-2021-47188: scsi: ufs: core: Improve SCSI abort handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Improve SCSI abort handling

The following has been observed on a test setup:

WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 250 at drivers/scsi/ufs/ufshcd.c:2737 ufshcd_queuecommand+0x468/0x65c
Call trace:
 ufshcd_queuecommand+0x468/0x65c
 scsi_send_eh_cmnd+0x224/0x6a0
 scsi_eh_test_devices+0x248/0x418
 scsi_eh_ready_devs+0xc34/0xe58
 scsi_error_handler+0x204/0x80c
 kthread+0x150/0x1b4
 ret_from_fork+0x10/0x30

That warning is triggered by the following statement:

	WARN_ON(lrbp->cmd);

Fix this warning by clearing lrbp->cmd from the abort handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47188 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
