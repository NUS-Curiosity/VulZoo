Subject: CVE-2021-47605: vduse: fix memory corruption in vduse_dev_ioctl()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vduse: fix memory corruption in vduse_dev_ioctl()

The "config.offset" comes from the user.  There needs to a check to
prevent it being out of bounds.  The "config.offset" and
"dev->config_size" variables are both type u32.  So if the offset if
out of bounds then the "dev->config_size - config.offset" subtraction
results in a very high u32 value.  The out of bounds offset can result
in memory corruption.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47605 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
