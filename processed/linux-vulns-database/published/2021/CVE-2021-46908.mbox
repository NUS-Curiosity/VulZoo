Subject: CVE-2021-46908: bpf: Use correct permission flag for mixed signed bounds arithmetic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Use correct permission flag for mixed signed bounds arithmetic

We forbid adding unknown scalars with mixed signed bounds due to the
spectre v1 masking mitigation. Hence this also needs bypass_spec_v1
flag instead of allow_ptr_leaks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46908 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 5.8 with commit 2c78ee898d8f and fixed in 5.10.32 with commit 4f3ff11204ea

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
