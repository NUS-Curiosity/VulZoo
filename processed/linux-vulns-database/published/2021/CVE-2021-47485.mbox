Subject: CVE-2021-47485: IB/qib: Protect from buffer overflow in struct qib_user_sdma_pkt fields

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/qib: Protect from buffer overflow in struct qib_user_sdma_pkt fields

Overflowing either addrlimit or bytes_togo can allow userspace to trigger
a buffer overflow of kernel memory. Check for overflows in all the places
doing math on user controlled buffers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47485 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
