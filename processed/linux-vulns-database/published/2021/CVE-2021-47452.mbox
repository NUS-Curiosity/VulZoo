Subject: CVE-2021-47452: netfilter: nf_tables: skip netdev events generated on netns removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: skip netdev events generated on netns removal

syzbot reported following (harmless) WARN:

 WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 2648 at net/netfilter/core.c:468
  nft_netdev_unregister_hooks net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:230 [inline]
  nf_tables_unregister_hook include/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h:1090 [inline]

  nf_tables_netdev_event+0x521/0x8a0 net/netfilter/nft_chain_filter.c:382

reproducer:
unshare -n bash -c 'ip link add br0 type bridge; nft add table netdev t ; \
 nft add chain netdev t ingress \{ type filter hook ingress device "br0" \
 priority 0\; policy drop\; \}'

Problem is that when netns device exit hooks create the UNREGISTER
event, the .pre_exit hook for nf_tables core has already removed the
base hook.  Notifier attempts to do this again.

The need to do base hook unregister unconditionally was needed in the past,
because notifier was last stage where reg->dev dereference was safe.

Now that nf_tables does the hook removal in .pre_exit, this isn't
needed anymore.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47452 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/90c7c58aa2bd02c65a4c63b7dfe0b16eab12cf9f
