sizes with the invalid config.

Without this patch, v4l2-compliance ends up allocating 4GiB of RAM and
causing the following OOPs

[   38.662975] ipu3-imgu 0000:00:05.0: swiotlb buffer is full (sz: 4096 bytes)
[   38.662980] DMA: Out of SW-IOMMU space for 4096 bytes at device 0000:00:05.0
[   38.663010] general protection fault: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46943 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
