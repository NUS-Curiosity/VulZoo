Subject: CVE-2021-47521: can: sja1000: fix use after free in ems_pcmcia_add_card()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: sja1000: fix use after free in ems_pcmcia_add_card()

If the last channel is not available then "dev" is freed.  Fortunately,
we can just use "pdev->irq" instead.

Also we should check if at least one channel was set up.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47521 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
