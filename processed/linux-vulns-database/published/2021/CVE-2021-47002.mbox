Subject: CVE-2021-47002: SUNRPC: Fix null pointer dereference in svc_rqst_free()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

SUNRPC: Fix null pointer dereference in svc_rqst_free()

When alloc_pages_node() returns null in svc_rqst_alloc(), the
null rq_scratch_page pointer will be dereferenced when calling
put_page() in svc_rqst_free(). Fix it by adding a null check.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference after null check")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47002 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
