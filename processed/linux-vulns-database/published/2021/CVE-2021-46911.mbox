Subject: CVE-2021-46911: ch_ktls: Fix kernel panic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ch_ktls: Fix kernel panic

Taking page refcount is not ideal and causes kernel panic
sometimes. It's better to take tx_ctx lock for the complete
skb transmit, to avoid page cleanup if ACK received in middle.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46911 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
