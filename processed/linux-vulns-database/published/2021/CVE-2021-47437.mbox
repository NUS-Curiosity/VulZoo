Subject: CVE-2021-47437: iio: adis16475: fix deadlock on frequency set

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adis16475: fix deadlock on frequency set

With commit 39c024b51b560
("iio: adis16475: improve sync scale mode handling"), two deadlocks were
introduced:
 1) The call to 'adis_write_reg_16()' was not changed to it's unlocked
    version.

This change fixes both these issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47437 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
