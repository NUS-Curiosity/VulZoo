Subject: CVE-2021-47622: scsi: ufs: Fix a deadlock in the error handler

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: Fix a deadlock in the error handler

The following deadlock has been observed on a test setup:

 - All tags allocated

 - The SCSI error handler calls ufshcd_eh_host_reset_handler()

 - ufshcd_eh_host_reset_handler() queues work that calls
   ufshcd_err_handler()

 - ufshcd_err_handler() locks up as follows:

Workqueue: ufs_eh_wq_0 ufshcd_err_handler.cfi_jt
Call trace:
 __switch_to+0x298/0x5d8
 __schedule+0x6cc/0xa94

Fix this lockup by making ufshcd_exec_dev_cmd() allocate a reserved
request.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47622 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
