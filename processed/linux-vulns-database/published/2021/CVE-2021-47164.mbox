Subject: CVE-2021-47164: net/mlx5e: Fix null deref accessing lag dev

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix null deref accessing lag dev

It could be the lag dev is null so stop processing the event.
In bond_enslave() the active/backup slave being set before setting the
upper dev so first event is without an upper dev.
After setting the upper dev with bond_master_upper_dev_link() there is
a second event and in that event we have an upper dev.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47164 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
