Subject: CVE-2021-47535: drm/msm/a6xx: Allocate enough space for GMU registers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/a6xx: Allocate enough space for GMU registers

In commit 142639a52a01 ("drm/msm/a6xx: fix crashstate capture for
A650") we changed a6xx_get_gmu_registers() to read 3 sets of
registers. Unfortunately, we didn't change the memory allocation for
the array. That leads to a KASAN warning (this was on the chromeos-5.4
kernel, which has the problematic commit backported to it):

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
