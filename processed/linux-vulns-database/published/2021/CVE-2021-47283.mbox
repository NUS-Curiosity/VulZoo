Subject: CVE-2021-47283: net:sfc: fix non-freed irq in legacy irq mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net:sfc: fix non-freed irq in legacy irq mode

SFC driver can be configured via modparam to work using MSI-X, MSI or
legacy IRQ interrupts. In the last one, the interrupt was not properly
released on module remove.

It was not freed because the flag irqs_hooked was not set during
initialization in the case of using legacy IRQ.

Example of (trimmed) trace during module remove without this fix:

remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'irq/125', leaking at least '0000:3b:00.1'

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8d717c9135a3340ae62d1699484850bfb4112b0c
