Subject: CVE-2021-47410: drm/amdkfd: fix svm_migrate_fini warning

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: fix svm_migrate_fini warning

Device manager releases device-specific resources when a driver
disconnects from a device, devm_memunmap_pages and
devm_release_mem_region calls in svm_migrate_fini are redundant.

It causes below warning trace after patch "drm/amdgpu: Split
amdgpu_device_fini into early and late", so remove function
svm_migrate_fini.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
