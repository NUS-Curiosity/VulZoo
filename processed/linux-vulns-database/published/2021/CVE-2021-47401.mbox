Subject: CVE-2021-47401: ipack: ipoctal: fix stack information leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipack: ipoctal: fix stack information leak

The tty driver name is used also after registering the driver and must
specifically not be allocated on the stack to avoid leaking information
to user space (or triggering an oops).

Drivers should not try to encode topology information in the tty device
name but this one snuck in through staging without anyone noticing and
another driver has since copied this malpractice.

Fixing the ABI is a separate issue, but this at least plugs the security
hole.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47401 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
