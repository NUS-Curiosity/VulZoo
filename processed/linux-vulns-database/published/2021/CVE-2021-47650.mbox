Subject: CVE-2021-47650: ASoC: soc-compress: prevent the potentially use of null pointer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: soc-compress: prevent the potentially use of null pointer

There is one call trace that snd_soc_register_card()
->snd_soc_bind_card()->soc_init_pcm_runtime()
->snd_soc_dai_compress_new()->snd_soc_new_compress().
In the trace the 'codec_dai' transfers from card->dai_link,
and we can see from the snd_soc_add_pcm_runtime() in
snd_soc_bind_card() that, if value of card->dai_link->num_codecs
is 0, then 'codec_dai' could be null pointer caused
by index out of bound in 'asoc_rtd_to_codec(rtd, 0)'.
And snd_soc_register_card() is called by various platforms.
Therefore, it is better to add the check in the case of misusing.
And because 'cpu_dai' has already checked in soc_init_pcm_runtime(),
there is no need to check again.
Adding the check as follow, then if 'codec_dai' is null,
snd_soc_new_compress() will not pass through the check
'if (playback + capture != 1)', avoiding the leftover use of
'codec_dai'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47650 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
