Subject: CVE-2021-47003: dmaengine: idxd: Fix potential null dereference on pointer status

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Fix potential null dereference on pointer status

There are calls to idxd_cmd_exec that pass a null status pointer however
a recent commit has added an assignment to *status that can end up
with a null pointer dereference.  The function expects a null status
pointer sometimes as there is a later assignment to *status where
status is first null checked.  Fix the issue by null checking status
before making the assignment.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Explicit null dereferenced")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47003 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
