Subject: CVE-2021-47113: btrfs: abort in rename_exchange if we fail to insert the second ref

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: abort in rename_exchange if we fail to insert the second ref

Error injection stress uncovered a problem where we'd leave a dangling
inode ref if we failed during a rename_exchange.  This happens because
we insert the inode ref for one side of the rename, and then for the
other side.  If this second inode ref insert fails we'll leave the first
one dangling and leave a corrupt file system behind.  Fix this by
aborting if we did the insert for the first inode ref.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47113 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
