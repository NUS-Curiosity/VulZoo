Subject: CVE-2021-47647: clk: qcom: ipq8074: fix PCI-E clock oops

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: qcom: ipq8074: fix PCI-E clock oops

Fix PCI-E clock related kernel oops that are caused by a missing clock
parent.

pcie0_rchng_clk_src has num_parents set to 2 but only one parent is
actually set via parent_hws, it should also have "XO" defined.
This will cause the kernel to panic on a NULL pointer in
clk_core_get_parent_by_index().

So, to fix this utilize clk_parent_data to provide gcc_xo_gpll0 parent
data.
Since there is already an existing static const char * const gcc_xo_gpll0[]
used to provide the same parents via parent_names convert those users to
clk_parent_data as well.

Without this earlycon is needed to even catch the OOPS as it will reset
the board before serial is initialized with the following:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
