Subject: CVE-2021-47463: mm/secretmem: fix NULL page->mapping dereference in page_is_secretmem()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/secretmem: fix NULL page->mapping dereference in page_is_secretmem()

Check for a NULL page->mapping before dereferencing the mapping in
page_is_secretmem(), as the page's mapping can be nullified while gup()
is running, e.g.  by reclaim or truncation.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
