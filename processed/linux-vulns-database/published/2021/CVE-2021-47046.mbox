Subject: CVE-2021-47046: drm/amd/display: Fix off by one in hdmi_14_process_transaction()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix off by one in hdmi_14_process_transaction()

The hdcp_i2c_offsets[] array did not have an entry for
HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_WRITE_CONTENT_STREAM_TYPE so it led to an off by one
read overflow.  I added an entry and copied the 0x0 value for the offset
from similar code in drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/modules/hdcp/hdcp_ddc.c.

I also declared several of these arrays as having HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_MAX
entries.  This doesn't change the code, but it's just a belt and
suspenders approach to try future proof the code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47046 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
