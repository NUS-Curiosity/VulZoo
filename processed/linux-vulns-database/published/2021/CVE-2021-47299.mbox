Subject: CVE-2021-47299: xdp, net: Fix use-after-free in bpf_xdp_link_release

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xdp, net: Fix use-after-free in bpf_xdp_link_release

The problem occurs between dev_get_by_index() and dev_xdp_attach_link().
At this point, dev_xdp_uninstall() is called. Then xdp link will not be
detached automatically when dev is released. But link->dev already
points to dev, when xdp link is released, dev will still be accessed,
but dev has been released.

dev_get_by_index()        |
link->dev = dev           |
                          |      rtnl_lock()
                          |      unregister_netdevice_many()
                          |          dev_xdp_uninstall()
                          |      rtnl_unlock()
rtnl_lock();              |
dev_xdp_attach_link()     |
rtnl_unlock();            |
                          |      netdev_run_todo() // dev released
bpf_xdp_link_release()    |
    /* access dev.        |
       use-after-free */  |

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
