Subject: CVE-2021-47158: net: dsa: sja1105: add error handling in sja1105_setup()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: sja1105: add error handling in sja1105_setup()

If any of sja1105_static_config_load(), sja1105_clocking_setup() or
sja1105_devlink_setup() fails, we can't just return in the middle of
sja1105_setup() or memory will leak. Add a cleanup path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47158 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
