Subject: CVE-2021-47260: NFS: Fix a potential NULL dereference in nfs_get_client()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFS: Fix a potential NULL dereference in nfs_get_client()

None of the callers are expecting NULL returns from nfs_get_client() so
this code will lead to an Oops.  It's better to return an error
pointer.  I expect that this is dead code so hopefully no one is
affected.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47260 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
