Subject: CVE-2021-47474: comedi: vmk80xx: fix bulk-buffer overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: vmk80xx: fix bulk-buffer overflow

The driver is using endpoint-sized buffers but must not assume that the
tx and rx buffers are of equal size or a malicious device could overflow
the slab-allocated receive buffer when doing bulk transfers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47474 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
