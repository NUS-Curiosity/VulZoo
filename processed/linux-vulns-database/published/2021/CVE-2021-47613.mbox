Subject: CVE-2021-47613: i2c: virtio: fix completion handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: virtio: fix completion handling

The driver currently assumes that the notify callback is only received
when the device is done with all the queued buffers.

However, this is not true, since the notify callback could be called
without any of the queued buffers being completed (for example, with
virtio-pci and shared interrupts) or with only some of the buffers being
completed (since the driver makes them available to the device in
multiple separate virtqueue_add_sgs() calls).

This can lead to incorrect data on the I2C bus or memory corruption in
the guest if the device operates on buffers which are have been freed by
the driver.  (The WARN_ON in the driver is also triggered.)

 BUG kmalloc-128 (Tainted: G        W        ): Poison overwritten
 First byte 0x0 instead of 0x6b

Fix this by calling virtio_get_buf() from the notify handler like other
virtio drivers and by actually waiting for all the buffers to be
completed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47613 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9cbb957441ed8873577d7d313a3d79d69f1dad5c
