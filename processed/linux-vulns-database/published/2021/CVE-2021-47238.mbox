In commit 24803f38a5c0 ("igmp: do not remove igmp souce list info when set
link down"), the ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() was removed,
because it was also called in igmpv3_clear_delrec().

Rough callgraph:

inetdev_destroy
-> ip_mc_destroy_dev
     -> igmpv3_clear_delrec
        -> ip_mc_clear_src
-> RCU_INIT_POINTER(dev->ip_ptr, NULL)

However, ip_mc_clear_src() called in igmpv3_clear_delrec() doesn't
release in_dev->mc_list->sources. And RCU_INIT_POINTER() assigns the
NULL to dev->ip_ptr. As a result, in_dev cannot be obtained through
inetdev_by_index() and then in_dev->mc_list->sources cannot be released
by ip_mc_del1_src() in the sock_close. Rough call sequence goes like:

sock_close
-> __sock_release
   -> inet_release
      -> ip_mc_drop_socket
         -> inetdev_by_index
         -> ip_mc_leave_src
            -> ip_mc_del_src
               -> ip_mc_del1_src

So we still need to call ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() to free
in_dev->mc_list->sources.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47238 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
