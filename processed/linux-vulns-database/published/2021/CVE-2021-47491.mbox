Subject: CVE-2021-47491: mm: khugepaged: skip huge page collapse for special files

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: khugepaged: skip huge page collapse for special files

The read-only THP for filesystems will collapse THP for files opened
readonly and mapped with VM_EXEC.  The intended usecase is to avoid TLB
misses for large text segments.  But it doesn't restrict the file types
so a THP could be collapsed for a non-regular file, for example, block
device, if it is opened readonly and mapped with EXEC permission.  This
may cause bugs, like [1] and [2].

This is definitely not the intended usecase, so just collapse THP for
regular files in order to close the attack surface.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
