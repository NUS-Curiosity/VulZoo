Subject: CVE-2021-46924: NFC: st21nfca: Fix memory leak in device probe and remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFC: st21nfca: Fix memory leak in device probe and remove

'phy->pending_skb' is alloced when device probe, but forgot to free
in the error handling path and remove path, this cause memory leak
as follows:

unreferenced object 0xffff88800bc06800 (size 512):
  comm "8", pid 11775, jiffies 4295159829 (age 9.032s)
  hex dump (first 32 bytes):
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
  backtrace:
    [<00000000d66c09ce>] __kmalloc_node_track_caller+0x1ed/0x450
    [<00000000c93382b3>] kmalloc_reserve+0x37/0xd0

    [<0000000019f29f9a>] st21nfca_hci_i2c_probe+0x170/0x8f2

Fix it by freeing 'pending_skb' in error and remove.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46924 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
