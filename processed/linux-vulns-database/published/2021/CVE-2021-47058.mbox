Subject: CVE-2021-47058: regmap: set debugfs_name to NULL after it is freed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regmap: set debugfs_name to NULL after it is freed

There is a upstream commit cffa4b2122f5("regmap:debugfs:
Fix a memory leak when calling regmap_attach_dev") that
adds a if condition when create name for debugfs_name.
With below function invoking logical, debugfs_name is
freed in regmap_debugfs_exit(), but it is not created again
because of the if condition introduced by above commit.
regmap_reinit_cache()
	regmap_debugfs_exit()
	...
	regmap_debugfs_init()
So, set debugfs_name to NULL after it is freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47058 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
