Subject: CVE-2021-47077: scsi: qedf: Add pointer checks in qedf_update_link_speed()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qedf: Add pointer checks in qedf_update_link_speed()

The following trace was observed:

 [   14.042059] Call Trace:

API qedf_link_update() is getting called from QED but by that time
shost_data is not initialised. This results in a NULL pointer dereference
when we try to dereference shost_data while updating supported_speeds.

Add a NULL pointer check before dereferencing shost_data.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47077 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
