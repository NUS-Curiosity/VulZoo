Subject: CVE-2021-47014: net/sched: act_ct: fix wild memory access when clearing fragments

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: act_ct: fix wild memory access when clearing fragments

while testing re-assembly/re-fragmentation using act_ct, it's possible to
observe a crash like the following one:

when act_ct temporarily stores an IP fragment, restoring the skb qdisc cb
results in putting random data in FRAG_CB(), and this causes those "wild"
memory accesses later, when the rbtree is purged. Never overwrite the skb
cb in case tcf_ct_handle_fragments() returns -EINPROGRESS.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47014 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0648941f4c8bbf8b4b6c0b270889ae7aa769b921
