Subject: CVE-2021-47134: efi/fdt: fix panic when no valid fdt found

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi/fdt: fix panic when no valid fdt found

setup_arch() would invoke efi_init()->efi_get_fdt_params(). If no
valid fdt found then initial_boot_params will be null. So we
should stop further fdt processing here. I encountered this
issue on risc-v.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47134 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
