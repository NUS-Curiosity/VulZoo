Subject: CVE-2021-47020: soundwire: stream: fix memory leak in stream config error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soundwire: stream: fix memory leak in stream config error path

When stream config is failed, master runtime will release all
slave runtime in the slave_rt_list, but slave runtime is not
added to the list at this time. This patch frees slave runtime
in the config error path to fix the memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47020 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
