Subject: CVE-2021-47256: mm/memory-failure: make sure wait for page writeback in memory_failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/memory-failure: make sure wait for page writeback in memory_failure

Our syzkaller trigger the "BUG_ON(!list_empty(&inode->i_wb_list))" in
clear_inode:

  kernel BUG at fs/inode.c:519!

  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception

A crash dump of this problem show that someone called __munlock_pagevec
to clear page LRU without lock_page: do_mmap -> mmap_region -> do_munmap
-> munlock_vma_pages_range -> __munlock_pagevec.

As a result memory_failure will call identify_page_state without
wait_on_page_writeback.  And after truncate_error_page clear the mapping
of this page.  end_page_writeback won't call sb_clear_inode_writeback to
clear inode->i_wb_list.  That will trigger BUG_ON in clear_inode!

Fix it by checking PageWriteback too to help determine should we skip
wait_on_page_writeback.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47256 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
