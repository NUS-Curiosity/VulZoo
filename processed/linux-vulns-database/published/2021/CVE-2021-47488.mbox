Subject: CVE-2021-47488: cgroup: Fix memory leak caused by missing cgroup_bpf_offline

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cgroup: Fix memory leak caused by missing cgroup_bpf_offline

When enabling CONFIG_CGROUP_BPF, kmemleak can be observed by running
the command as below:

    $mount -t cgroup -o none,name=foo cgroup cgroup/
    $umount cgroup/

unreferenced object 0xc3585c40 (size 64):
  comm "mount", pid 425, jiffies 4294959825 (age 31.990s)
  hex dump (first 32 bytes):

    [<06dd06e0>] ret_fast_syscall+0x0/0x48

This is because that since the commit 2b0d3d3e4fcf ("percpu_ref: reduce
memory footprint of percpu_ref in fast path") root_cgrp->bpf.refcnt.data
is allocated by the function percpu_ref_init in cgroup_bpf_inherit which
is called by cgroup_setup_root when mounting, but not freed along with
root_cgrp when umounting. Adding cgroup_bpf_offline which calls
percpu_ref_kill to cgroup_kill_sb can free root_cgrp->bpf.refcnt.data in
umount path.

This patch also fixes the commit 4bfc0bb2c60e ("bpf: decouple the lifetime
of cgroup_bpf from cgroup itself"). A cgroup_bpf_offline is needed to do a
cleanup that frees the resources which are allocated by cgroup_bpf_inherit
in cgroup_setup_root.

And inside cgroup_bpf_offline, cgroup_get() is at the beginning and
cgroup_put is at the end of cgroup_bpf_release which is called by
cgroup_bpf_offline. So cgroup_bpf_offline can keep the balance of
cgroup's refcount.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47488 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
