Subject: CVE-2021-46917: dmaengine: idxd: fix wq cleanup of WQCFG registers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: fix wq cleanup of WQCFG registers

A pre-release silicon erratum workaround where wq reset does not clear
WQCFG registers was leaked into upstream code. Use wq reset command
instead of blasting the MMIO region. This also address an issue where
we clobber registers in future devices.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46917 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
