Subject: CVE-2021-47012: RDMA/siw: Fix a use after free in siw_alloc_mr

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/siw: Fix a use after free in siw_alloc_mr

Our code analyzer reported a UAF.

In siw_alloc_mr(), it calls siw_mr_add_mem(mr,..). In the implementation of
siw_mr_add_mem(), mem is assigned to mr->mem and then mem is freed via
kfree(mem) if xa_alloc_cyclic() failed. Here, mr->mem still point to a
freed object. After, the execution continue up to the err_out branch of
siw_alloc_mr, and the freed mr->mem is used in siw_mr_drop_mem(mr).

My patch moves "mr->mem = mem" behind the if (xa_alloc_cyclic(..)<0) {}
section, to avoid the uaf.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47012 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
