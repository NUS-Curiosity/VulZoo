Subject: CVE-2021-47599: btrfs: use latest_dev in btrfs_show_devname

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: use latest_dev in btrfs_show_devname

The test case btrfs/238 reports the warning below:

 WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 481 at fs/btrfs/super.c:2509 btrfs_show_devname+0x104/0x1e8 [btrfs]
 CPU: 2 PID: 1 Comm: systemd Tainted: G        W  O 5.14.0-rc1-custom #72
 Hardware name: QEMU QEMU Virtual Machine, BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015

Reason:
While btrfs_prepare_sprout() moves the fs_devices::devices into
fs_devices::seed_list, the btrfs_show_devname() searches for the devices
and found none, leading to the warning as in above.

Fix:
latest_dev is updated according to the changes to the device list.
That means we could use the latest_dev->name to show the device name in
/proc/self/mounts, the pointer will be always valid as it's assigned
before the device is deleted from the list in remove or replace.
The RCU protection is sufficient as the device structure is freed after
synchronization.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47599 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
