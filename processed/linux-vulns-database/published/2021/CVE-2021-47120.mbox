Subject: CVE-2021-47120: HID: magicmouse: fix NULL-deref on disconnect

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: magicmouse: fix NULL-deref on disconnect

Commit 9d7b18668956 ("HID: magicmouse: add support for Apple Magic
Trackpad 2") added a sanity check for an Apple trackpad but returned
success instead of -ENODEV when the check failed. This means that the
remove callback will dereference the never-initialised driver data
pointer when the driver is later unbound (e.g. on USB disconnect).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47120 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
