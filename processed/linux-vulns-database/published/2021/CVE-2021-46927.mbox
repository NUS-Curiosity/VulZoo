Subject: CVE-2021-46927: nitro_enclaves: Use get_user_pages_unlocked() call to handle mmap assert

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nitro_enclaves: Use get_user_pages_unlocked() call to handle mmap assert

After commit 5b78ed24e8ec ("mm/pagemap: add mmap_assert_locked()
annotations to find_vma*()"), the call to get_user_pages() will trigger
the mmap assert.

static inline void mmap_assert_locked(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
	lockdep_assert_held(&mm->mmap_lock);
	VM_BUG_ON_MM(!rwsem_is_locked(&mm->mmap_lock), mm);
}

Use get_user_pages_unlocked() when setting the enclave memory regions.
That's a similar pattern as mmap_read_lock() used together with
get_user_pages().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46927 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/90d2beed5e753805c5eab656b8d48257638fe543
