Subject: CVE-2021-47641: video: fbdev: cirrusfb: check pixclock to avoid divide by zero

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

video: fbdev: cirrusfb: check pixclock to avoid divide by zero

Do a sanity check on pixclock value to avoid divide by zero.

If the pixclock value is zero, the cirrusfb driver will round up
pixclock to get the derived frequency as close to maxclock as
possible.

Syzkaller reported a divide error in cirrusfb_check_pixclock.

divide error: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN PTI

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
