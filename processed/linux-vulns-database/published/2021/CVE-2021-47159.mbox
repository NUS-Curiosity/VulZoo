Subject: CVE-2021-47159: net: dsa: fix a crash if ->get_sset_count() fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: fix a crash if ->get_sset_count() fails

If ds->ops->get_sset_count() fails then it "count" is a negative error
code such as -EOPNOTSUPP.  Because "i" is an unsigned int, the negative
error code is type promoted to a very high value and the loop will
corrupt memory until the system crashes.

Fix this by checking for error codes and changing the type of "i" to
just int.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47159 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
