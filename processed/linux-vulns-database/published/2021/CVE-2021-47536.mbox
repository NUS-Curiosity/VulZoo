Subject: CVE-2021-47536: net/smc: fix wrong list_del in smc_lgr_cleanup_early

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: fix wrong list_del in smc_lgr_cleanup_early

smc_lgr_cleanup_early() meant to delete the link
group from the link group list, but it deleted
the list head by mistake.

This may cause memory corruption since we didn't
remove the real link group from the list and later
memseted the link group structure.
We got a list corruption panic when testing:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
