Subject: CVE-2021-47403: ipack: ipoctal: fix module reference leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipack: ipoctal: fix module reference leak

A reference to the carrier module was taken on every open but was only
released once when the final reference to the tty struct was dropped.

Fix this by taking the module reference and initialising the tty driver
data when installing the tty.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47403 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
