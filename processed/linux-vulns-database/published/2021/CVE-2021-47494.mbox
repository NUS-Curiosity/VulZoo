Subject: CVE-2021-47494: cfg80211: fix management registrations locking

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cfg80211: fix management registrations locking

The management registrations locking was broken, the list was
locked for each wdev, but cfg80211_mgmt_registrations_update()
iterated it without holding all the correct spinlocks, causing
list corruption.

Rather than trying to fix it with fine-grained locking, just
move the lock to the wiphy/rdev (still need the list on each
wdev), we already need to hold the wdev lock to change it, so
there's no contention on the lock in any case. This trivially
fixes the bug since we hold one wdev's lock already, and now
will hold the lock that protects all lists.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47494 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
