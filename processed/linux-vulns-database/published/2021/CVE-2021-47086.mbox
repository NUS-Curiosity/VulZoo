Subject: CVE-2021-47086: phonet/pep: refuse to enable an unbound pipe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phonet/pep: refuse to enable an unbound pipe

This ioctl() implicitly assumed that the socket was already bound to
a valid local socket name, i.e. Phonet object. If the socket was not
bound, two separate problems would occur:

1) We'd send an pipe enablement request with an invalid source object.
2) Later socket calls could BUG on the socket unexpectedly being
   connected yet not bound to a valid object.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47086 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
