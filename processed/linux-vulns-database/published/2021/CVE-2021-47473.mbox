Subject: CVE-2021-47473: scsi: qla2xxx: Fix a memory leak in an error path of qla2x00_process_els()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix a memory leak in an error path of qla2x00_process_els()

Commit 8c0eb596baa5 ("[SCSI] qla2xxx: Fix a memory leak in an error path of
qla2x00_process_els()"), intended to change:

        bsg_job->request->msgcode == FC_BSG_HST_ELS_NOLOGIN


        bsg_job->request->msgcode != FC_BSG_RPT_ELS

but changed it to:

        bsg_job->request->msgcode == FC_BSG_RPT_ELS

instead.

Change the == to a != to avoid leaking the fcport structure or freeing
unallocated memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47473 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
