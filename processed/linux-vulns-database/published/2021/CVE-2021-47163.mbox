Subject: CVE-2021-47163: tipc: wait and exit until all work queues are done

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tipc: wait and exit until all work queues are done

On some host, a crash could be triggered simply by repeating these
commands several times:

  # modprobe tipc
  # tipc bearer enable media udp name UDP1 localip 127.0.0.1
  # rmmod tipc

  [] BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffffc096bb00
  [] Workqueue: events 0xffffffffc096bb00
  [] Call Trace:
  []  ? process_one_work+0x1a7/0x360
  []  ? worker_thread+0x30/0x390
  []  ? create_worker+0x1a0/0x1a0
  []  ? kthread+0x116/0x130
  []  ? kthread_flush_work_fn+0x10/0x10
  []  ? ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40

When removing the TIPC module, the UDP tunnel sock will be delayed to
release in a work queue as sock_release() can't be done in rtnl_lock().
If the work queue is schedule to run after the TIPC module is removed,
kernel will crash as the work queue function cleanup_beareri() code no
longer exists when trying to invoke it.

To fix it, this patch introduce a member wq_count in tipc_net to track
the numbers of work queues in schedule, and  wait and exit until all
work queues are done in tipc_exit_net().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47163 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
