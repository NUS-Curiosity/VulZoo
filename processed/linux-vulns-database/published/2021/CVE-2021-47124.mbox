Subject: CVE-2021-47124: io_uring: fix link timeout refs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix link timeout refs

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 10242 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0x15b/0x1a0 lib/refcount.c:28
RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0x15b/0x1a0 lib/refcount.c:28

io_link_timeout_fn() should put only one reference of the linked timeout
request, however in case of racing with the master request's completion
first io_req_complete() puts one and then io_put_req_deferred() is
called.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47124 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
