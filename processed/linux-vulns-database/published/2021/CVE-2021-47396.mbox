Subject: CVE-2021-47396: mac80211-hwsim: fix late beacon hrtimer handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mac80211-hwsim: fix late beacon hrtimer handling

Thomas explained in https://lore.kernel.org/r/87mtoeb4hb.ffs@tglx
that our handling of the hrtimer here is wrong: If the timer fires
late (e.g. due to vCPU scheduling, as reported by Dmitry/syzbot)
then it tries to actually rearm the timer at the next deadline,
which might be in the past already:

 1          2          3          N          N+1
 |          |          |   ...    |          |

 ^ intended to fire here (1)
            ^ next deadline here (2)
                                      ^ actually fired here

The next time it fires, it's later, but will still try to schedule
for the next deadline (now 3), etc. until it catches up with N,
but that might take a long time, causing stalls etc.

Now, all of this is simulation, so we just have to fix it, but
note that the behaviour is wrong even per spec, since there's no
value then in sending all those beacons unaligned - they should be
aligned to the TBTT (1, 2, 3, ... in the picture), and if we're a
bit (or a lot) late, then just resume at that point.

Therefore, change the code to use hrtimer_forward_now() which will
ensure that the next firing of the timer would be at N+1 (in the
picture), i.e. the next interval point after the current time.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47396 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
