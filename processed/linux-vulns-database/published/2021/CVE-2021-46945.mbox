Subject: CVE-2021-46945: ext4: always panic when errors=panic is specified

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: always panic when errors=panic is specified

Before commit 014c9caa29d3 ("ext4: make ext4_abort() use
__ext4_error()"), the following series of commands would trigger a
panic:

1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test
2. mount /dev/sda -o remount,abort test

After commit 014c9caa29d3, remounting a file system using the test
mount option "abort" will no longer trigger a panic.  This commit will
restore the behaviour immediately before commit 014c9caa29d3.
(However, note that the Linux kernel's behavior has not been
consistent; some previous kernel versions, including 5.4 and 4.19
similarly did not panic after using the mount option "abort".)

This also makes a change to long-standing behaviour; namely, the
following series commands will now cause a panic, when previously it
did not:

1. mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test
2. echo test > /sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger_fs_error

However, this makes ext4's behaviour much more consistent, so this is
a good thing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46945 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/64e1eebe2131183174f4fbb6b1491355f96c6cde
