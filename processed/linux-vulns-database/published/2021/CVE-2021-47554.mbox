Subject: CVE-2021-47554: vdpa_sim: avoid putting an uninitialized iova_domain

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vdpa_sim: avoid putting an uninitialized iova_domain

The system will crash if we put an uninitialized iova_domain, this
could happen when an error occurs before initializing the iova_domain
in vdpasim_create().

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
...
RIP: 0010:__cpuhp_state_remove_instance+0x96/0x1c0
...
Call Trace:
 <TASK>

 ...

So we must make sure the iova_domain is already initialized before
put it.

In addition, we may get the following warning in this case:
WARNING: ... drivers/iommu/iova.c:344 iova_cache_put+0x58/0x70

So we must make sure the iova_cache_put() is invoked only if the
iova_cache_get() is already invoked. Let's fix it together.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47554 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e4d58ac67e63727aa45a4a26185876f598e8b3dd
