Subject: CVE-2021-47450: KVM: arm64: Fix host stage-2 PGD refcount

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: Fix host stage-2 PGD refcount

The KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated stage-2
PGDs individually. However, when running KVM in protected mode, the
host's stage-2 PGD is currently managed by EL2 as a single high-order
compound page, which can cause the refcount of the tail pages to reach 0
when they shouldn't, hence corrupting the page-table.

Fix this by introducing a new hyp_split_page() helper in the EL2 page
allocator (matching the kernel's split_page() function), and make use of
it from host_s2_zalloc_pages_exact().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47450 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
