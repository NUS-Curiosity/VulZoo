Subject: CVE-2021-47071: uio_hv_generic: Fix a memory leak in error handling paths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uio_hv_generic: Fix a memory leak in error handling paths

If 'vmbus_establish_gpadl()' fails, the (recv|send)_gpadl will not be
updated and 'hv_uio_cleanup()' in the error handling path will not be
able to free the corresponding buffer.

In such a case, we need to free the buffer explicitly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47071 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
