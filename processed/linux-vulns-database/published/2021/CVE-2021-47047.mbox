Subject: CVE-2021-47047: spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: return -ENOMEM if dma_map_single fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: return -ENOMEM if dma_map_single fails

The spi controller supports 44-bit address space on AXI in DMA mode,
so set dma_addr_t width to 44-bit to avoid using a swiotlb mapping.
In addition, if dma_map_single fails, it should return immediately
instead of continuing doing the DMA operation which bases on invalid
address.

This fixes the following crash which occurs in reading a big block
from flash:

[  123.633577] zynqmp-qspi ff0f0000.spi: swiotlb buffer is full (sz: 4194304 bytes), total 32768 (slots), used 0 (slots)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
