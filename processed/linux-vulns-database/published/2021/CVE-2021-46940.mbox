Subject: CVE-2021-46940: tools/power turbostat: Fix offset overflow issue in index converting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tools/power turbostat: Fix offset overflow issue in index converting

The idx_to_offset() function returns type int (32-bit signed), but
MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STAT is u32 and would be interpreted as a negative number.
The end result is that it hits the if (offset < 0) check in update_msr_sum()
which prevents the timer callback from updating the stat in the background when
long durations are used. The similar issue exists in offset_to_idx() and
update_msr_sum(). Fix this issue by converting the 'int' to 'off_t' accordingly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46940 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
