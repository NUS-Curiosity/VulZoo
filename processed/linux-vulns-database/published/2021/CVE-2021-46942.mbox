Subject: CVE-2021-46942: io_uring: fix shared sqpoll cancellation hangs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix shared sqpoll cancellation hangs

[  736.982891] INFO: task iou-sqp-4294:4295 blocked for more than 122 seconds.
[  736.982897] Call Trace:
[  736.982901]  schedule+0x68/0xe0

We call io_uring_cancel_sqpoll() one by one for each ctx either in
sq_thread() itself or via task works, and it's intended to cancel all
requests of a specified context. However the function uses per-task
counters to track the number of inflight requests, so it counts more
requests than available via currect io_uring ctx and goes to sleep for
them to appear (e.g. from IRQ), that will never happen.

Cancel a bit more than before, i.e. all ctxs that share sqpoll
and continue to use shared counters. Don't forget that we should not
remove ctx from the list before running that task_work sqpoll-cancel,
otherwise the function wouldn't be able to find the context and will
hang.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46942 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
