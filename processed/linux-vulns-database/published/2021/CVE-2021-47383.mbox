Subject: CVE-2021-47383: tty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: Fix out-of-bound vmalloc access in imageblit

This issue happens when a userspace program does an ioctl
FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO passing the fb_var_screeninfo struct
containing only the fields xres, yres, and bits_per_pixel
with values.

If this struct is the same as the previous ioctl, the
vc_resize() detects it and doesn't call the resize_screen(),
leaving the fb_var_screeninfo incomplete. And this leads to
the updatescrollmode() calculates a wrong value to
fbcon_display->vrows, which makes the real_y() return a
wrong value of y, and that value, eventually, causes
the imageblit to access an out-of-bound address value.

To solve this issue I made the resize_screen() be called
even if the screen does not need any resizing, so it will
"fix and fill" the fb_var_screeninfo independently.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47383 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
