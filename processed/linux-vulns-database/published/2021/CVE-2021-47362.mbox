Subject: CVE-2021-47362: drm/amd/pm: Update intermediate power state for SI

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/pm: Update intermediate power state for SI

Update the current state as boot state during dpm initialization.
During the subsequent initialization, set_power_state gets called to
transition to the final power state. set_power_state refers to values
from the current state and without current state populated, it could
result in NULL pointer dereference.

For ex: on platforms where PCI speed change is supported through ACPI
ATCS method, the link speed of current state needs to be queried before
deciding on changing to final power state's link speed. The logic to query
ATCS-support was broken on certain platforms. The issue became visible
when broken ATCS-support logic got fixed with commit
f9b7f3703ff9 ("drm/amdgpu/acpi: make ATPX/ATCS structures global (v2)").

Bug: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/amd/-/issues/1698

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47362 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
