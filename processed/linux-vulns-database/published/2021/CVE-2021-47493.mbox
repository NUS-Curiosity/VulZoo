Subject: CVE-2021-47493: ocfs2: fix race between searching chunks and release journal_head from buffer_head

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix race between searching chunks and release journal_head from buffer_head

Encountered a race between ocfs2_test_bg_bit_allocatable() and
jbd2_journal_put_journal_head() resulting in the below vmcore.

When ocfs2_test_bg_bit_allocatable() called bh2jh(bg_bh), the
bg_bh->b_private NULL as jbd2_journal_put_journal_head() raced and
released the jounal head from the buffer head.  Needed to take bit lock
for the bit 'BH_JournalHead' to fix this race.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47493 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
