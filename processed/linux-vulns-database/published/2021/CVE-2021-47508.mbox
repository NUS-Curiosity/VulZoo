Subject: CVE-2021-47508: btrfs: free exchange changeset on failures

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: free exchange changeset on failures

Fstests runs on my VMs have show several kmemleak reports like the following.

  unreferenced object 0xffff88811ae59080 (size 64):

In case brtfs_qgroup_reserve_data() or btrfs_delalloc_reserve_metadata()
fail the allocated extent_changeset will not be freed.

So in btrfs_check_data_free_space() and btrfs_delalloc_reserve_space()
free the allocated extent_changeset to get rid of the allocated memory.

The issue currently only happens in the direct IO write path, but only
after 65b3c08606e5 ("btrfs: fix ENOSPC failure when attempting direct IO
write into NOCOW range"), and also at defrag_one_locked_target(). Every
other place is always calling extent_changeset_free() even if its call
to btrfs_delalloc_reserve_space() or btrfs_check_data_free_space() has
failed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47508 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/btrfs/delalloc-space.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ca06c5cb1b6dbfe67655b33c02fc394d65824519
