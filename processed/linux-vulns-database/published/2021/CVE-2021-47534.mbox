Subject: CVE-2021-47534: drm/vc4: kms: Add missing drm_crtc_commit_put

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vc4: kms: Add missing drm_crtc_commit_put

Commit 9ec03d7f1ed3 ("drm/vc4: kms: Wait on previous FIFO users before a
commit") introduced a global state for the HVS, with each FIFO storing
the current CRTC commit so that we can properly synchronize commits.

However, the refcounting was off and we thus ended up leaking the
drm_crtc_commit structure every commit. Add a drm_crtc_commit_put to
prevent the leakage.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47534 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/53f9601e908d42481addd67cdb01a9288c611124
