Subject: CVE-2021-47447: drm/msm/a3xx: fix error handling in a3xx_gpu_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/a3xx: fix error handling in a3xx_gpu_init()

These error paths returned 1 on failure, instead of a negative error
code.  This would lead to an Oops in the caller.  A second problem is
that the check for "if (ret != -ENODATA)" did not work because "ret" was
set to 1.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47447 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 5.11 with commit 5785dd7a8ef0 and fixed in 5.14.14 with commit d59e44e7821a
	Issue introduced in 5.11 with commit 5785dd7a8ef0 and fixed in 5.15 with commit 3eda90199537

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/a3xx_gpu.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
