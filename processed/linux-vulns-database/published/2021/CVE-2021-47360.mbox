Subject: CVE-2021-47360: binder: make sure fd closes complete

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: make sure fd closes complete

During BC_FREE_BUFFER processing, the BINDER_TYPE_FDA object
cleanup may close 1 or more fds. The close operations are
completed using the task work mechanism -- which means the thread
needs to return to userspace or the file object may never be
dereferenced -- which can lead to hung processes.

Force the binder thread back to userspace if an fd is closed during
BC_FREE_BUFFER handling.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47360 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
