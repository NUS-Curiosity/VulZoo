Subject: CVE-2021-47445: drm/msm: Fix null pointer dereference on pointer edp

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: Fix null pointer dereference on pointer edp

The initialization of pointer dev dereferences pointer edp before
edp is null checked, so there is a potential null pointer deference
issue. Fix this by only dereferencing edp after edp has been null
checked.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference before null check")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47445 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
