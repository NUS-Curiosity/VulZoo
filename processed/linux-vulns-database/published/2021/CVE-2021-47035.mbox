Subject: CVE-2021-47035: iommu/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entries

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entries

When the first level page table is used for IOVA translation, it only
supports Read-Only and Read-Write permissions. The Write-Only permission
is not supported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read permission) should
always set. When using second level, we still give separate permissions
that allows WriteOnly which seems inconsistent and awkward. We want to
have consistent behavior. After moving to 1st level, we don't want things
to work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same mappings.
Hence remove this configuration.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47035 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
