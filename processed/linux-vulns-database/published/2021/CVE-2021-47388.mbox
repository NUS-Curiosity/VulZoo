Subject: CVE-2021-47388: mac80211: fix use-after-free in CCMP/GCMP RX

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mac80211: fix use-after-free in CCMP/GCMP RX

When PN checking is done in mac80211, for fragmentation we need
to copy the PN to the RX struct so we can later use it to do a
comparison, since commit bf30ca922a0c ("mac80211: check defrag
PN against current frame").

Unfortunately, in that commit I used the 'hdr' variable without
it being necessarily valid, so use-after-free could occur if it
was necessary to reallocate (parts of) the frame.

Fix this by reloading the variable after the code that results
in the reallocations, if any.

This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214401.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47388 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
