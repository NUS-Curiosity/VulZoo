Subject: CVE-2021-47039: ataflop: potential out of bounds in do_format()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ataflop: potential out of bounds in do_format()

The function uses "type" as an array index:

	q = unit[drive].disk[type]->queue;

Unfortunately the bounds check on "type" isn't done until later in the
function.  Fix this by moving the bounds check to the start.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47039 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
