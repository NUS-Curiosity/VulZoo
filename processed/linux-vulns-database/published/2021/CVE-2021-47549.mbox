Subject: CVE-2021-47549: sata_fsl: fix UAF in sata_fsl_port_stop when rmmod sata_fsl

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sata_fsl: fix UAF in sata_fsl_port_stop when rmmod sata_fsl

When the `rmmod sata_fsl.ko` command is executed in the PPC64 GNU/Linux,
a bug is reported:
 ==================================================================
 BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on read at 0x80000800805b502c

 ==================================================================

The triggering of the BUG is shown in the following stack:

driver_detach
  device_release_driver_internal
    __device_release_driver
      drv->remove(dev) --> platform_drv_remove/platform_remove
        drv->remove(dev) --> sata_fsl_remove
          iounmap(host_priv->hcr_base);			<---- unmap
          kfree(host_priv);                             <---- free
      devres_release_all
        release_nodes
          dr->node.release(dev, dr->data) --> ata_host_stop
            ap->ops->port_stop(ap) --> sata_fsl_port_stop
                ioread32(hcr_base + HCONTROL)           <---- UAF
            host->ops->host_stop(host)

The iounmap(host_priv->hcr_base) and kfree(host_priv) functions should
not be executed in drv->remove. These functions should be executed in
host_stop after port_stop. Therefore, we move these functions to the
new function sata_fsl_host_stop and bind the new function to host_stop.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47549 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
