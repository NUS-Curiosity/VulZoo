Subject: CVE-2021-47593: mptcp: clear 'kern' flag from fallback sockets

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: clear 'kern' flag from fallback sockets

The mptcp ULP extension relies on sk->sk_sock_kern being set correctly:
It prevents setsockopt(fd, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_ULP, "mptcp", 6); from
working for plain tcp sockets (any userspace-exposed socket).

But in case of fallback, accept() can return a plain tcp sk.
In such case, sk is still tagged as 'kernel' and setsockopt will work.

This will crash the kernel, The subflow extension has a NULL ctx->conn
mptcp socket:

BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in subflow_data_ready+0x181/0x2b0
Call Trace:
 tcp_data_ready+0xf8/0x370
 [..]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47593 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
