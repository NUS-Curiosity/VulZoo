Subject: CVE-2021-47184: i40e: Fix NULL ptr dereference on VSI filter sync

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: Fix NULL ptr dereference on VSI filter sync

Remove the reason of null pointer dereference in sync VSI filters.
Added new I40E_VSI_RELEASING flag to signalize deleting and releasing
of VSI resources to sync this thread with sync filters subtask.
Without this patch it is possible to start update the VSI filter list
after VSI is removed, that's causing a kernel oops.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47184 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
