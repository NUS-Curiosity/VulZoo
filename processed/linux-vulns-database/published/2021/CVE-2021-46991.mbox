Subject: CVE-2021-46991: i40e: Fix use-after-free in i40e_client_subtask()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: Fix use-after-free in i40e_client_subtask()

Currently the call to i40e_client_del_instance frees the object
pf->cinst, however pf->cinst->lan_info is being accessed after
the free. Fix this by adding the missing return.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Read from pointer after free")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46991 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
