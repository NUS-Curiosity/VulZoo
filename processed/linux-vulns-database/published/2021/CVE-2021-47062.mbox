Subject: CVE-2021-47062: KVM: SVM: Use online_vcpus, not created_vcpus, to iterate over vCPUs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: Use online_vcpus, not created_vcpus, to iterate over vCPUs

Use the kvm_for_each_vcpu() helper to iterate over vCPUs when encrypting
VMSAs for SEV, which effectively switches to use online_vcpus instead of
created_vcpus.  This fixes a possible null-pointer dereference as
created_vcpus does not guarantee a vCPU exists, since it is updated at
the very beginning of KVM_CREATE_VCPU.  created_vcpus exists to allow the
bulk of vCPU creation to run in parallel, while still correctly
restricting the max number of max vCPUs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47062 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
