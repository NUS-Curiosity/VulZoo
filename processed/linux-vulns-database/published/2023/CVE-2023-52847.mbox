Subject: CVE-2023-52847: media: bttv: fix use after free error due to btv->timeout timer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: bttv: fix use after free error due to btv->timeout timer

There may be some a race condition between timer function
bttv_irq_timeout and bttv_remove. The timer is setup in
probe and there is no timer_delete operation in remove
function. When it hit kfree btv, the function might still be
invoked, which will cause use after free bug.

This bug is found by static analysis, it may be false positive.

Fix it by adding del_timer_sync invoking to the remove function.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
