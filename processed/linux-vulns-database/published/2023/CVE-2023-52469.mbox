Subject: CVE-2023-52469: drivers/amd/pm: fix a use-after-free in kv_parse_power_table

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/amd/pm: fix a use-after-free in kv_parse_power_table

When ps allocated by kzalloc equals to NULL, kv_parse_power_table
frees adev->pm.dpm.ps that allocated before. However, after the control
flow goes through the following call chains:

kv_parse_power_table
  |-> kv_dpm_init
        |-> kv_dpm_sw_init
	      |-> kv_dpm_fini

The adev->pm.dpm.ps is used in the for loop of kv_dpm_fini after its
first free in kv_parse_power_table and causes a use-after-free bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52469 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
