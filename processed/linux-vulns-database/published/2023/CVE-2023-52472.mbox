Subject: CVE-2023-52472: crypto: rsa - add a check for allocation failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: rsa - add a check for allocation failure

Static checkers insist that the mpi_alloc() allocation can fail so add
a check to prevent a NULL dereference.  Small allocations like this
can't actually fail in current kernels, but adding a check is very
simple and makes the static checkers happy.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52472 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
