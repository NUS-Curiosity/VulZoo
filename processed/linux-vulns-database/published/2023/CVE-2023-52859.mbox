Subject: CVE-2023-52859: perf: hisi: Fix use-after-free when register pmu fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: hisi: Fix use-after-free when register pmu fails

When we fail to register the uncore pmu, the pmu context may not been
allocated. The error handing will call cpuhp_state_remove_instance()
to call uncore pmu offline callback, which migrate the pmu context.
Since that's liable to lead to some kind of use-after-free.

Use cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls() instead of
cpuhp_state_remove_instance() so that the notifiers don't execute after
the PMU device has been failed to register.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52859 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
