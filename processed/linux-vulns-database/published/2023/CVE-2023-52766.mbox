Subject: CVE-2023-52766: i3c: mipi-i3c-hci: Fix out of bounds access in hci_dma_irq_handler

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i3c: mipi-i3c-hci: Fix out of bounds access in hci_dma_irq_handler

Do not loop over ring headers in hci_dma_irq_handler() that are not
allocated and enabled in hci_dma_init(). Otherwise out of bounds access
will occur from rings->headers[i] access when i >= number of allocated
ring headers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52766 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
