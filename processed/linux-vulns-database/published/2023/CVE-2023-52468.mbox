Subject: CVE-2023-52468: class: fix use-after-free in class_register()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

class: fix use-after-free in class_register()

The lock_class_key is still registered and can be found in
lock_keys_hash hlist after subsys_private is freed in error
handler path.A task who iterate over the lock_keys_hash
later may cause use-after-free.So fix that up and unregister
the lock_class_key before kfree(cp).

On our platform, a driver fails to kset_register because of
creating duplicate filename '/class/xxx'.With Kasan enabled,
it prints a invalid-access bug report.

KASAN bug report:

BUG: KASAN: invalid-access in lockdep_register_key+0x19c/0x1bc

As CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC is not set, Kasan reports invalid-access
not use-after-free here.In this case, modprobe is manipulating
the corrupted lock_keys_hash hlish where lock_class_key is already
freed before.

It's worth noting that this only can happen if lockdep is enabled,
which is not true for normal system.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52468 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
