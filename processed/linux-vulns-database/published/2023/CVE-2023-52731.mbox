Subject: CVE-2023-52731: fbdev: Fix invalid page access after closing deferred I/O devices

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: Fix invalid page access after closing deferred I/O devices

When a fbdev with deferred I/O is once opened and closed, the dirty
pages still remain queued in the pageref list, and eventually later
those may be processed in the delayed work.  This may lead to a
corruption of pages, hitting an Oops.

This patch makes sure to cancel the delayed work and clean up the
pageref list at closing the device for addressing the bug.  A part of
the cleanup code is factored out as a new helper function that is
called from the common fb_release().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52731 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
