Subject: CVE-2023-52795: vhost-vdpa: fix use after free in vhost_vdpa_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vhost-vdpa: fix use after free in vhost_vdpa_probe()

The put_device() calls vhost_vdpa_release_dev() which calls
ida_simple_remove() and frees "v".  So this call to
ida_simple_remove() is a use after free and a double free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52795 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
