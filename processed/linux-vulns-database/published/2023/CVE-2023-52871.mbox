Subject: CVE-2023-52871: soc: qcom: llcc: Handle a second device without data corruption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: llcc: Handle a second device without data corruption

Usually there is only one llcc device. But if there were a second, even
a failed probe call would modify the global drv_data pointer. So check
if drv_data is valid before overwriting it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52871 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
