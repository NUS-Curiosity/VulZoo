Subject: CVE-2023-52668: btrfs: zoned: fix lock ordering in btrfs_zone_activate()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zoned: fix lock ordering in btrfs_zone_activate()

The btrfs CI reported a lockdep warning as follows by running generic
generic/129.

   WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
   6.7.0-rc5+ #1 Not tainted
   ------------------------------------------------------
   kworker/u5:5/793427 is trying to acquire lock:
   ffff88813256d028 (&cache->lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at: btrfs_zone_finish_one_bg+0x5e/0x130
   but task is already holding lock:
   ffff88810a23a318 (&fs_info->zone_active_bgs_lock){+.+.}-{2:2}, at: btrfs_zone_finish_one_bg+0x34/0x130
   which lock already depends on the new lock.

   the existing dependency chain (in reverse order) is:
   -> #1 (&fs_info->zone_active_bgs_lock){+.+.}-{2:2}:
   ...
   -> #0 (&cache->lock){+.+.}-{2:2}:
   ...

This is because we take fs_info->zone_active_bgs_lock after a block_group's
lock in btrfs_zone_activate() while doing the opposite in other places.

Fix the issue by expanding the fs_info->zone_active_bgs_lock's critical
section and taking it before a block_group's lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52668 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
