Subject: CVE-2023-52850: media: hantro: Check whether reset op is defined before use

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: hantro: Check whether reset op is defined before use

The i.MX8MM/N/P does not define the .reset op since reset of the VPU is
done by genpd. Check whether the .reset op is defined before calling it
to avoid NULL pointer dereference.

Note that the Fixes tag is set to the commit which removed the reset op
from i.MX8M Hantro G2 implementation, this is because before this commit
all the implementations did define the .reset op.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52850 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
