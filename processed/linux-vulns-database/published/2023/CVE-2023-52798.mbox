Subject: CVE-2023-52798: wifi: ath11k: fix dfs radar event locking

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix dfs radar event locking

The ath11k active pdevs are protected by RCU but the DFS radar event
handling code calling ath11k_mac_get_ar_by_pdev_id() was not marked as a
read-side critical section.

Mark the code in question as an RCU read-side critical section to avoid
any potential use-after-free issues.

Compile tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52798 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
