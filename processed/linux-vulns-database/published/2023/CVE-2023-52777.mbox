Subject: CVE-2023-52777: wifi: ath11k: fix gtk offload status event locking

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix gtk offload status event locking

The ath11k active pdevs are protected by RCU but the gtk offload status
event handling code calling ath11k_mac_get_arvif_by_vdev_id() was not
marked as a read-side critical section.

Mark the code in question as an RCU read-side critical section to avoid
any potential use-after-free issues.

Compile tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52777 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
