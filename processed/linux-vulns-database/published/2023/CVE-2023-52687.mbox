Subject: CVE-2023-52687: crypto: safexcel - Add error handling for dma_map_sg() calls

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: safexcel - Add error handling for dma_map_sg() calls

Macro dma_map_sg() may return 0 on error. This patch enables
checks in case of the macro failure and ensures unmapping of
previously mapped buffers with dma_unmap_sg().

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static
analysis tool SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52687 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
