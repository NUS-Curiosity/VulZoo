Subject: CVE-2023-52581: netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak when more than 255 elements expired

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak when more than 255 elements expired

When more than 255 elements expired we're supposed to switch to a new gc
container structure.

This never happens: u8 type will wrap before reaching the boundary
and nft_trans_gc_space() always returns true.

This means we recycle the initial gc container structure and
lose track of the elements that came before.

While at it, don't deref 'gc' after we've passed it to call_rcu.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52581 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
