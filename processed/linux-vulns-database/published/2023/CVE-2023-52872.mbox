Subject: CVE-2023-52872: tty: n_gsm: fix race condition in status line change on dead connections

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: n_gsm: fix race condition in status line change on dead connections

gsm_cleanup_mux() cleans up the gsm by closing all DLCIs, stopping all
timers, removing the virtual tty devices and clearing the data queues.
This procedure, however, may cause subsequent changes of the virtual modem
status lines of a DLCI. More data is being added the outgoing data queue
and the deleted kick timer is restarted to handle this. At this point many
resources have already been removed by the cleanup procedure. Thus, a
kernel panic occurs.

Fix this by proving in gsm_modem_update() that the cleanup procedure has
not been started and the mux is still alive.

Note that writing to a virtual tty is already protected by checks against
the DLCI specific connection state.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52872 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
