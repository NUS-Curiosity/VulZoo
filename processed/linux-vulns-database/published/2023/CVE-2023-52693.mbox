Subject: CVE-2023-52693: ACPI: video: check for error while searching for backlight device parent

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: video: check for error while searching for backlight device parent

If acpi_get_parent() called in acpi_video_dev_register_backlight()
fails, for example, because acpi_ut_acquire_mutex() fails inside
acpi_get_parent), this can lead to incorrect (uninitialized)
acpi_parent handle being passed to acpi_get_pci_dev() for detecting
the parent pci device.

Check acpi_get_parent() result and set parent device only in case of success.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52693 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
