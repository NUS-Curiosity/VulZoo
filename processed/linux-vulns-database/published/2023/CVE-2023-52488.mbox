Subject: CVE-2023-52488: serial: sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for FIFO

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for FIFO

The SC16IS7XX IC supports a burst mode to access the FIFOs where the
initial register address is sent ($00), followed by all the FIFO data
without having to resend the register address each time. In this mode, the
IC doesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte.

The regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can
perform IO over multiple registers. They are currently used to read/write
from/to the FIFO, and although they operate correctly in this burst mode on
the SPI bus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if it was not disabled
manually. The reason is that when the R/W size is more than 1 byte, these
functions assume that the register address is incremented and handle the
cache accordingly.

Convert FIFO R/W functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versions in order to
remove the manual cache control which was a workaround when using the
_raw_ versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatile so
cache will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52488 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
