Subject: CVE-2023-52849: cxl/mem: Fix shutdown order

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/mem: Fix shutdown order

Ira reports that removing cxl_mock_mem causes a crash with the following
trace:

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000044
 [..]
 RIP: 0010:cxl_region_decode_reset+0x7f/0x180 [cxl_core]

This crash is due to the clearing out the cxl_memdev's driver context
(@cxlds) before the subsystem is done with it. This is ultimately due to
the region(s), that this memdev is a member, being torn down and expecting
to be able to de-reference @cxlds, like here:

static int cxl_region_decode_reset(struct cxl_region *cxlr, int count)
...
                if (cxlds->rcd)
                        goto endpoint_reset;
...

Fix it by keeping the driver context valid until memdev-device
unregistration, and subsequently the entire stack of related
dependencies, unwinds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52849 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
