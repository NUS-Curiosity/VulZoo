Subject: CVE-2023-52639: KVM: s390: vsie: fix race during shadow creation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: s390: vsie: fix race during shadow creation

Right now it is possible to see gmap->private being zero in
kvm_s390_vsie_gmap_notifier resulting in a crash.  This is due to the
fact that we add gmap->private == kvm after creation:

static int acquire_gmap_shadow(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu,
                               struct vsie_page *vsie_page)
{
[...]
        gmap = gmap_shadow(vcpu->arch.gmap, asce, edat);
        if (IS_ERR(gmap))
                return PTR_ERR(gmap);
        gmap->private = vcpu->kvm;

Let children inherit the private field of the parent.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52639 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
