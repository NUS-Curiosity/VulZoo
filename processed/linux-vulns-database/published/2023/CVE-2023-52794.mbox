Subject: CVE-2023-52794: thermal: intel: powerclamp: fix mismatch in get function for max_idle

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: intel: powerclamp: fix mismatch in get function for max_idle

KASAN reported this

      [ 444.853098] BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in param_get_int+0x77/0x90
      [ 444.853111] Read of size 4 at addr ffffffffc16c9220 by task cat/2105
      ...
      [ 444.853442] The buggy address belongs to the variable:
      [ 444.853443] max_idle+0x0/0xffffffffffffcde0 [intel_powerclamp]

There is a mismatch between the param_get_int and the definition of
max_idle.  Replacing param_get_int with param_get_byte resolves this
issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52794 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
