Subject: CVE-2023-52690: powerpc/powernv: Add a null pointer check to scom_debug_init_one()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/powernv: Add a null pointer check to scom_debug_init_one()

kasprintf() returns a pointer to dynamically allocated memory
which can be NULL upon failure.
Add a null pointer check, and release 'ent' to avoid memory leaks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52690 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
