Subject: CVE-2023-52917: ntb: intel: Fix the NULL vs IS_ERR() bug for debugfs_create_dir()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntb: intel: Fix the NULL vs IS_ERR() bug for debugfs_create_dir()

The debugfs_create_dir() function returns error pointers.
It never returns NULL. So use IS_ERR() to check it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52917 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
