Subject: CVE-2023-52653: SUNRPC: fix a memleak in gss_import_v2_context

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

SUNRPC: fix a memleak in gss_import_v2_context

The ctx->mech_used.data allocated by kmemdup is not freed in neither
gss_import_v2_context nor it only caller gss_krb5_import_sec_context,
which frees ctx on error.

Thus, this patch reform the last call of gss_import_v2_context to the
gss_krb5_import_ctx_v2, preventing the memleak while keepping the return
formation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52653 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
