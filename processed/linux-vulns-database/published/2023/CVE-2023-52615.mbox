Subject: CVE-2023-52615: hwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng

There is a dead-lock in the hwrng device read path.  This triggers
when the user reads from /dev/hwrng into memory also mmap-ed from
/dev/hwrng.  The resulting page fault triggers a recursive read
which then dead-locks.

Fix this by using a stack buffer when calling copy_to_user.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52615 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
