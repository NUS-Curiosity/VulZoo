Subject: CVE-2023-52773: drm/amd/display: fix a NULL pointer dereference in amdgpu_dm_i2c_xfer()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: fix a NULL pointer dereference in amdgpu_dm_i2c_xfer()

When ddc_service_construct() is called, it explicitly checks both the
link type and whether there is something on the link which will
dictate whether the pin is marked as hw_supported.

If the pin isn't set or the link is not set (such as from
unloading/reloading amdgpu in an IGT test) then fail the
amdgpu_dm_i2c_xfer() call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52773 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
