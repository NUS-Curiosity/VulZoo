Subject: CVE-2023-52770: f2fs: split initial and dynamic conditions for extent_cache

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: split initial and dynamic conditions for extent_cache

Let's allocate the extent_cache tree without dynamic conditions to avoid a
missing condition causing a panic as below.

 # create a file w/ a compressed flag
 # disable the compression
 # panic while updating extent_cache

F2FS-fs (dm-64): Swapfile: last extent is not aligned to section
F2FS-fs (dm-64): Swapfile (3) is not align to section: 1) creat(), 2) ioctl(F2FS_IOC_SET_PIN_FILE), 3) fallocate(2097152 * N)
Adding 124996k swap on ./swap-file.  Priority:0 extents:2 across:17179494468k

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9de787139b0258a5dd1f498780c26d76b61d2958
