Subject: CVE-2023-52526: erofs: fix memory leak of LZMA global compressed deduplication

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix memory leak of LZMA global compressed deduplication

When stressing microLZMA EROFS images with the new global compressed
deduplication feature enabled (`-Ededupe`), I found some short-lived
temporary pages weren't properly released, which could slowly cause
unexpected OOMs hours later.

Let's fix it now (LZ4 and DEFLATE don't have this issue.)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52526 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
