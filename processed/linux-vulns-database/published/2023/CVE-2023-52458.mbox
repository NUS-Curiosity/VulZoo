Subject: CVE-2023-52458: block: add check that partition length needs to be aligned with block size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: add check that partition length needs to be aligned with block size

Before calling add partition or resize partition, there is no check
on whether the length is aligned with the logical block size.
If the logical block size of the disk is larger than 512 bytes,
then the partition size maybe not the multiple of the logical block size,
and when the last sector is read, bio_truncate() will adjust the bio size,
resulting in an IO error if the size of the read command is smaller than
the logical block size.If integrity data is supported, this will also
result in a null pointer dereference when calling bio_integrity_free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52458 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
