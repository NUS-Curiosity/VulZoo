Subject: CVE-2023-52927: netfilter: allow exp not to be removed in nf_ct_find_expectation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: allow exp not to be removed in nf_ct_find_expectation

Currently nf_conntrack_in() calling nf_ct_find_expectation() will
remove the exp from the hash table. However, in some scenario, we
expect the exp not to be removed when the created ct will not be
confirmed, like in OVS and TC conntrack in the following patches.

This patch allows exp not to be removed by setting IPS_CONFIRMED
in the status of the tmpl.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52927 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.130 with commit 3fa58a6fbd1e9e5682d09cdafb08fba004cb12ec
	Fixed in 6.6 with commit 4914109a8e1e494c6aa9852f9e84ec77a5fc643f

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
