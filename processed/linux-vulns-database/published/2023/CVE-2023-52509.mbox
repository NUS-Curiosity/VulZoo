Subject: CVE-2023-52509: ravb: Fix use-after-free issue in ravb_tx_timeout_work()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ravb: Fix use-after-free issue in ravb_tx_timeout_work()

The ravb_stop() should call cancel_work_sync(). Otherwise,
ravb_tx_timeout_work() is possible to use the freed priv after
ravb_remove() was called like below:

CPU0			CPU1
			ravb_tx_timeout()
ravb_remove()
unregister_netdev()
free_netdev(ndev)
// free priv
			ravb_tx_timeout_work()
			// use priv

unregister_netdev() will call .ndo_stop() so that ravb_stop() is
called. And, after phy_stop() is called, netif_carrier_off()
is also called. So that .ndo_tx_timeout() will not be called
after phy_stop().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52509 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
