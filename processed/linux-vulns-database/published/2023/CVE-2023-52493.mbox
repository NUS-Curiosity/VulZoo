Subject: CVE-2023-52493: bus: mhi: host: Drop chan lock before queuing buffers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: mhi: host: Drop chan lock before queuing buffers

Ensure read and write locks for the channel are not taken in succession by
dropping the read lock from parse_xfer_event() such that a callback given
to client can potentially queue buffers and acquire the write lock in that
process. Any queueing of buffers should be done without channel read lock
acquired as it can result in multiple locks and a soft lockup.

[mani: added fixes tag and cc'ed stable]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52493 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
