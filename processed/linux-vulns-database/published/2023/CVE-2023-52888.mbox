Subject: CVE-2023-52888: media: mediatek: vcodec: Only free buffer VA that is not NULL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mediatek: vcodec: Only free buffer VA that is not NULL

In the MediaTek vcodec driver, while mtk_vcodec_mem_free() is mostly
called only when the buffer to free exists, there are some instances
that didn't do the check and triggered warnings in practice.

We believe those checks were forgotten unintentionally. Add the checks
back to fix the warnings.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52888 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
