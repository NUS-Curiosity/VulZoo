Subject: CVE-2023-52735: bpf, sockmap: Don't let sock_map_{close,destroy,unhash} call itself

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Don't let sock_map_{close,destroy,unhash} call itself

sock_map proto callbacks should never call themselves by design. Protect
against bugs like [1] and break out of the recursive loop to avoid a stack
overflow in favor of a resource leak.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
