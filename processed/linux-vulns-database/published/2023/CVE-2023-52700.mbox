Subject: CVE-2023-52700: tipc: fix kernel warning when sending SYN message

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tipc: fix kernel warning when sending SYN message

When sending a SYN message, this kernel stack trace is observed:

...
[   13.396352] RIP: 0010:_copy_from_iter+0xb4/0x550
...

It is because commit a41dad905e5a ("iov_iter: saner checks for attempt
to copy to/from iterator") has introduced sanity check for copying
from/to iov iterator. Lacking of copy direction from the iterator
viewpoint would lead to kernel stack trace like above.

This commit fixes this issue by initializing the iov iterator with
the correct copy direction when sending SYN or ACK without data.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52700 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
