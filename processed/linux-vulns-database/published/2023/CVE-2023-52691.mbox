Subject: CVE-2023-52691: drm/amd/pm: fix a double-free in si_dpm_init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/pm: fix a double-free in si_dpm_init

When the allocation of
adev->pm.dpm.dyn_state.vddc_dependency_on_dispclk.entries fails,
amdgpu_free_extended_power_table is called to free some fields of adev.
However, when the control flow returns to si_dpm_sw_init, it goes to
label dpm_failed and calls si_dpm_fini, which calls
amdgpu_free_extended_power_table again and free those fields again. Thus
a double-free is triggered.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52691 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
