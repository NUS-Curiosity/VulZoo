Subject: CVE-2023-52916: media: aspeed: Fix memory overwrite if timing is 1600x900

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: aspeed: Fix memory overwrite if timing is 1600x900

When capturing 1600x900, system could crash when system memory usage is
tight.

The way to reproduce this issue:
1. Use 1600x900 to display on host
2. Mount ISO through 'Virtual media' on OpenBMC's web
3. Run script as below on host to do sha continuously
  #!/bin/bash
  while [ [1] ];
  do
	find /media -type f -printf '"%h/%f"\n' | xargs sha256sum
  done
4. Open KVM on OpenBMC's web

The size of macro block captured is 8x8. Therefore, we should make sure
the height of src-buf is 8 aligned to fix this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52916 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
