Subject: CVE-2023-52593: wifi: wfx: fix possible NULL pointer dereference in wfx_set_mfp_ap()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: wfx: fix possible NULL pointer dereference in wfx_set_mfp_ap()

Since 'ieee80211_beacon_get()' can return NULL, 'wfx_set_mfp_ap()'
should check the return value before examining skb data. So convert
the latter to return an appropriate error code and propagate it to
return from 'wfx_start_ap()' as well. Compile tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52593 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.1.77 with commit 574dcd3126aa
	Fixed in 6.6.16 with commit 9ab224744a47

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
