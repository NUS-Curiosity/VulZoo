Subject: CVE-2023-52914: io_uring/poll: add hash if ready poll request can't complete inline

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/poll: add hash if ready poll request can't complete inline

If we don't, then we may lose access to it completely, leading to a
request leak. This will eventually stall the ring exit process as
well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52914 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
