Subject: CVE-2023-52768: wifi: wilc1000: use vmm_table as array in wilc struct

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: wilc1000: use vmm_table as array in wilc struct

Enabling KASAN and running some iperf tests raises some memory issues with
vmm_table:

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in wilc_wlan_handle_txq+0x6ac/0xdb4
Write of size 4 at addr c3a61540 by task wlan0-tx/95

KASAN detects that we are writing data beyond range allocated to vmm_table.
There is indeed a mismatch between the size passed to allocator in
wilc_wlan_init, and the range of possible indexes used later: allocation
size is missing a multiplication by sizeof(u32)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52768 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
