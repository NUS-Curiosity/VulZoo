Subject: CVE-2023-52899: Add exception protection processing for vd in axi_chan_handle_err function

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Add exception protection processing for vd in axi_chan_handle_err function

Since there is no protection for vd, a kernel panic will be
triggered here in exceptional cases.

You can refer to the processing of axi_chan_block_xfer_complete function

The triggered kernel panic is as follows:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
