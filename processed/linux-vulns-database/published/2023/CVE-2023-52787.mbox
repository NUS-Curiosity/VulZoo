Subject: CVE-2023-52787: blk-mq: make sure active queue usage is held for bio_integrity_prep()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: make sure active queue usage is held for bio_integrity_prep()

blk_integrity_unregister() can come if queue usage counter isn't held
for one bio with integrity prepared, so this request may be completed with
calling profile->complete_fn, then kernel panic.

Another constraint is that bio_integrity_prep() needs to be called
before bio merge.

Fix the issue by:

- call bio_integrity_prep() with one queue usage counter grabbed reliably

- call bio_integrity_prep() before bio merge

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52787 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
