Subject: CVE-2023-52697: ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_common: ctx->headset_codec_dev = NULL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_common: ctx->headset_codec_dev = NULL

sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit() are used by different codecs, and some of
them use the same dai name.
For example, rt712 and rt713 both use "rt712-sdca-aif1" and
sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit().
As a result, sof_sdw_rt_sdca_jack_exit() will be called twice by
mc_dailink_exit_loop(). Set ctx->headset_codec_dev = NULL; after
put_device(ctx->headset_codec_dev); to avoid ctx->headset_codec_dev
being put twice.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52697 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
