Subject: CVE-2023-52520: platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix reference leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix reference leak

If a duplicate attribute is found using kset_find_obj(), a reference
to that attribute is returned which needs to be disposed accordingly
using kobject_put(). Move the setting name validation into a separate
function to allow for this change without having to duplicate the
cleanup code for this setting.
As a side note, a very similar bug was fixed in
commit 7295a996fdab ("platform/x86: dell-sysman: Fix reference leak"),
so it seems that the bug was copied from that driver.

Compile-tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52520 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
