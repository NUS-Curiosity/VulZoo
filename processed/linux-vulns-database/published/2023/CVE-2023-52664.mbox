Subject: CVE-2023-52664: net: atlantic: eliminate double free in error handling logic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: atlantic: eliminate double free in error handling logic

Driver has a logic leak in ring data allocation/free,
where aq_ring_free could be called multiple times on same ring,
if system is under stress and got memory allocation error.

Ring pointer was used as an indicator of failure, but this is
not correct since only ring data is allocated/deallocated.
Ring itself is an array member.

Changing ring allocation functions to return error code directly.
This simplifies error handling and eliminates aq_ring_free
on higher layer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52664 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
