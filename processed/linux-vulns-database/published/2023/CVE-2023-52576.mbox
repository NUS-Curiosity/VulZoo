Subject: CVE-2023-52576: x86/mm, kexec, ima: Use memblock_free_late() from ima_free_kexec_buffer()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mm, kexec, ima: Use memblock_free_late() from ima_free_kexec_buffer()

The code calling ima_free_kexec_buffer() runs long after the memblock
allocator has already been torn down, potentially resulting in a use
after free in memblock_isolate_range().

With KASAN or KFENCE, this use after free will result in a BUG
from the idle task, and a subsequent kernel panic.

Switch ima_free_kexec_buffer() over to memblock_free_late() to avoid
that bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52576 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
