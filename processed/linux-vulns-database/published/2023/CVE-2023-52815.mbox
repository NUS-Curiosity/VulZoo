Subject: CVE-2023-52815: drm/amdgpu/vkms: fix a possible null pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu/vkms: fix a possible null pointer dereference

In amdgpu_vkms_conn_get_modes(), the return value of drm_cvt_mode()
is assigned to mode, which will lead to a NULL pointer dereference
on failure of drm_cvt_mode(). Add a check to avoid null pointer
dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52815 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
