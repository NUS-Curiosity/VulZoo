Subject: CVE-2023-52459: media: v4l: async: Fix duplicated list deletion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: v4l: async: Fix duplicated list deletion

The list deletion call dropped here is already called from the
helper function in the line before. Having a second list_del()
call results in either a warning (with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y):

list_del corruption, c46c8198->next is LIST_POISON1 (00000100)

If CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is disabled the operation results in a
kernel error due to NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52459 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
