Subject: CVE-2023-52491: media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mtk-jpeg: Fix use after free bug due to error path handling in mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run

In mtk_jpeg_probe, &jpeg->job_timeout_work is bound with
mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work.

In mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run, if error happens in
mtk_jpeg_set_dec_dst, it will finally start the worker while
mark the job as finished by invoking v4l2_m2m_job_finish.

There are two methods to trigger the bug. If we remove the
module, it which will call mtk_jpeg_remove to make cleanup.
The possible sequence is as follows, which will cause a
use-after-free bug.

CPU0                  CPU1
mtk_jpeg_dec_...    |
  start worker	    |
                    |mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work
mtk_jpeg_remove     |
  v4l2_m2m_release  |
    kfree(m2m_dev); |
                    |
                    | v4l2_m2m_get_curr_priv
                    |   m2m_dev->curr_ctx //use

If we close the file descriptor, which will call mtk_jpeg_release,
it will have a similar sequence.

Fix this bug by starting timeout worker only if started jpegdec worker
successfully. Then v4l2_m2m_job_finish will only be called in
either mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work or mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52491 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
