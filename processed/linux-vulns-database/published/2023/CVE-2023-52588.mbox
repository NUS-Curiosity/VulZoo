Subject: CVE-2023-52588: f2fs: fix to tag gcing flag on page during block migration

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to tag gcing flag on page during block migration

It needs to add missing gcing flag on page during block migration,
in order to garantee migrated data be persisted during checkpoint,
otherwise out-of-order persistency between data and node may cause
data corruption after SPOR.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
