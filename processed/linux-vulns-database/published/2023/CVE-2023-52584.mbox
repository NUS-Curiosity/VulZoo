Subject: CVE-2023-52584: spmi: mediatek: Fix UAF on device remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spmi: mediatek: Fix UAF on device remove

The pmif driver data that contains the clocks is allocated along with
spmi_controller.
On device remove, spmi_controller will be freed first, and then devres
, including the clocks, will be cleanup.
This leads to UAF because putting the clocks will access the clocks in
the pmif driver data, which is already freed along with spmi_controller.

This can be reproduced by enabling DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE and
building the kernel with KASAN.

Fix the UAF issue by using unmanaged clk_bulk_get() and putting the
clocks before freeing spmi_controller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52584 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
