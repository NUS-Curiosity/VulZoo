Subject: CVE-2023-52880: tty: n_gsm: require CAP_NET_ADMIN to attach N_GSM0710 ldisc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: n_gsm: require CAP_NET_ADMIN to attach N_GSM0710 ldisc

Any unprivileged user can attach N_GSM0710 ldisc, but it requires
CAP_NET_ADMIN to create a GSM network anyway.

Require initial namespace CAP_NET_ADMIN to do that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52880 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
