Subject: CVE-2023-52464: EDAC/thunderx: Fix possible out-of-bounds string access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

EDAC/thunderx: Fix possible out-of-bounds string access

Enabling -Wstringop-overflow globally exposes a warning for a common bug
in the usage of strncat():

  drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c: In function 'thunderx_ocx_com_threaded_isr':
  drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c:1136:17: error: 'strncat' specified bound 1024 equals destination size [-Werror=stringop-overflow=]
   1136 |                 strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);
        |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ...
   1145 |                                 strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);
   ...
   1150 |                                 strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);

   ...

Apparently the author of this driver expected strncat() to behave the
way that strlcat() does, which uses the size of the destination buffer
as its third argument rather than the length of the source buffer. The
result is that there is no check on the size of the allocated buffer.

Change it to strlcat().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
