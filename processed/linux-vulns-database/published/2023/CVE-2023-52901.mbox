Subject: CVE-2023-52901: usb: xhci: Check endpoint is valid before dereferencing it

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Check endpoint is valid before dereferencing it

When the host controller is not responding, all URBs queued to all
endpoints need to be killed. This can cause a kernel panic if we
dereference an invalid endpoint.

Fix this by using xhci_get_virt_ep() helper to find the endpoint and
checking if the endpoint is valid before dereferencing it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
