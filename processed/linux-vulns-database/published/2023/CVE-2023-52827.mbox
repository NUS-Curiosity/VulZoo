Subject: CVE-2023-52827: wifi: ath12k: fix possible out-of-bound read in ath12k_htt_pull_ppdu_stats()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix possible out-of-bound read in ath12k_htt_pull_ppdu_stats()

len is extracted from HTT message and could be an unexpected value in
case errors happen, so add validation before using to avoid possible
out-of-bound read in the following message iteration and parsing.

The same issue also applies to ppdu_info->ppdu_stats.common.num_users,
so validate it before using too.

These are found during code review.

Compile test only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52827 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
