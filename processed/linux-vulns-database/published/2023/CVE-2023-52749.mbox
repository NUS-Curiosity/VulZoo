Subject: CVE-2023-52749: spi: Fix null dereference on suspend

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: Fix null dereference on suspend

A race condition exists where a synchronous (noqueue) transfer can be
active during a system suspend. This can cause a null pointer
dereference exception to occur when the system resumes.

Example order of events leading to the exception:
1. spi_sync() calls __spi_transfer_message_noqueue() which sets
   ctlr->cur_msg
2. Spi transfer begins via spi_transfer_one_message()
3. System is suspended interrupting the transfer context
4. System is resumed
6. spi_controller_resume() calls spi_start_queue() which resets cur_msg
   to NULL
7. Spi transfer context resumes and spi_finalize_current_message() is
   called which dereferences cur_msg (which is now NULL)

Wait for synchronous transfers to complete before suspending by
acquiring the bus mutex and setting/checking a suspend flag.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52749 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/spi/spi.c
	include/linux/spi/spi.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
