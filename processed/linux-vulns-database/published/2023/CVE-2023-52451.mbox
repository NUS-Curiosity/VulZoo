Subject: CVE-2023-52451: powerpc/pseries/memhp: Fix access beyond end of drmem array

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pseries/memhp: Fix access beyond end of drmem array

dlpar_memory_remove_by_index() may access beyond the bounds of the
drmem lmb array when the LMB lookup fails to match an entry with the
given DRC index. When the search fails, the cursor is left pointing to
&drmem_info->lmbs[drmem_info->n_lmbs], which is one element past the
last valid entry in the array. The debug message at the end of the
function then dereferences this pointer:

        pr_debug("Failed to hot-remove memory at %llx\n",
                 lmb->base_addr);

This was found by inspection and confirmed with KASAN:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
