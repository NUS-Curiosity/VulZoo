Subject: CVE-2023-52831: cpu/hotplug: Don't offline the last non-isolated CPU

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpu/hotplug: Don't offline the last non-isolated CPU

If a system has isolated CPUs via the "isolcpus=" command line parameter,
then an attempt to offline the last housekeeping CPU will result in a
WARN_ON() when rebuilding the scheduler domains and a subsequent panic due
to and unhandled empty CPU mas in partition_sched_domains_locked().

cpuset_hotplug_workfn()
  rebuild_sched_domains_locked()
    ndoms = generate_sched_domains(&doms, &attr);
      cpumask_and(doms[0], top_cpuset.effective_cpus, housekeeping_cpumask(HK_FLAG_DOMAIN));

Thus results in an empty CPU mask which triggers the warning and then the
subsequent crash:

WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 80 at kernel/sched/topology.c:2366 build_sched_domains+0x120c/0x1408
Call trace:
 build_sched_domains+0x120c/0x1408

 partition_sched_domains_locked+0x318/0x880
 rebuild_sched_domains_locked+0x37c/0x798

Aside of the resulting crash, it does not make any sense to offline the last
last housekeeping CPU.

Prevent this by masking out the non-housekeeping CPUs when selecting a
target CPU for initiating the CPU unplug operation via the work queue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52831 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
