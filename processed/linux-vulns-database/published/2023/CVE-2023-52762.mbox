Subject: CVE-2023-52762: virtio-blk: fix implicit overflow on virtio_max_dma_size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio-blk: fix implicit overflow on virtio_max_dma_size

The following codes have an implicit conversion from size_t to u32:
(u32)max_size = (size_t)virtio_max_dma_size(vdev);

This may lead overflow, Ex (size_t)4G -> (u32)0. Once
virtio_max_dma_size() has a larger size than U32_MAX, use U32_MAX
instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52762 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
