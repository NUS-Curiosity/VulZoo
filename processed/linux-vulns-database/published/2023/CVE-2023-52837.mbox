Subject: CVE-2023-52837: nbd: fix uaf in nbd_open

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: fix uaf in nbd_open

Commit 4af5f2e03013 ("nbd: use blk_mq_alloc_disk and
blk_cleanup_disk") cleans up disk by blk_cleanup_disk() and it won't set
disk->private_data as NULL as before. UAF may be triggered in nbd_open()
if someone tries to open nbd device right after nbd_put() since nbd has
been free in nbd_dev_remove().

Fix this by implementing ->free_disk and free private data in it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52837 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
