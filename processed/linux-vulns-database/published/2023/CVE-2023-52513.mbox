Subject: CVE-2023-52513: RDMA/siw: Fix connection failure handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/siw: Fix connection failure handling

In case immediate MPA request processing fails, the newly
created endpoint unlinks the listening endpoint and is
ready to be dropped. This special case was not handled
correctly by the code handling the later TCP socket close,
causing a NULL dereference crash in siw_cm_work_handler()
when dereferencing a NULL listener. We now also cancel
the useless MPA timeout, if immediate MPA request
processing fails.

This patch furthermore simplifies MPA processing in general:
Scheduling a useless TCP socket read in sk_data_ready() upcall
is now surpressed, if the socket is already moved out of
TCP_ESTABLISHED state.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52513 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
