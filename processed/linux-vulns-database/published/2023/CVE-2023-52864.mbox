Subject: CVE-2023-52864: platform/x86: wmi: Fix opening of char device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: wmi: Fix opening of char device

Since commit fa1f68db6ca7 ("drivers: misc: pass miscdevice pointer via
file private data"), the miscdevice stores a pointer to itself inside
filp->private_data, which means that private_data will not be NULL when
wmi_char_open() is called. This might cause memory corruption should
wmi_char_open() be unable to find its driver, something which can
happen when the associated WMI device is deleted in wmi_free_devices().

Fix the problem by using the miscdevice pointer to retrieve the WMI
device data associated with a char device using container_of(). This
also avoids wmi_char_open() picking a wrong WMI device bound to a
driver with the same name as the original driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52864 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
