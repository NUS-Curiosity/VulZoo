Subject: CVE-2023-52681: efivarfs: Free s_fs_info on unmount

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efivarfs: Free s_fs_info on unmount

Now that we allocate a s_fs_info struct on fs context creation, we
should ensure that we free it again when the superblock goes away.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52681 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
