Subject: CVE-2023-52790: swiotlb: fix out-of-bounds TLB allocations with CONFIG_SWIOTLB_DYNAMIC

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

swiotlb: fix out-of-bounds TLB allocations with CONFIG_SWIOTLB_DYNAMIC

Limit the free list length to the size of the IO TLB. Transient pool can be
smaller than IO_TLB_SEGSIZE, but the free list is initialized with the
assumption that the total number of slots is a multiple of IO_TLB_SEGSIZE.
As a result, swiotlb_area_find_slots() may allocate slots past the end of
a transient IO TLB buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52790 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
