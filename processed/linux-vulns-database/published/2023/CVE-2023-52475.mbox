Subject: CVE-2023-52475: Input: powermate - fix use-after-free in powermate_config_complete

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: powermate - fix use-after-free in powermate_config_complete

syzbot has found a use-after-free bug [1] in the powermate driver. This
happens when the device is disconnected, which leads to a memory free from
the powermate_device struct.  When an asynchronous control message
completes after the kfree and its callback is invoked, the lock does not
exist anymore and hence the bug.

Use usb_kill_urb() on pm->config to cancel any in-progress requests upon
device disconnection.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
