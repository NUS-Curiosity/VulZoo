Subject: CVE-2023-52704: freezer,umh: Fix call_usermode_helper_exec() vs SIGKILL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

freezer,umh: Fix call_usermode_helper_exec() vs SIGKILL

Tetsuo-San noted that commit f5d39b020809 ("freezer,sched: Rewrite
core freezer logic") broke call_usermodehelper_exec() for the KILLABLE
case.

Specifically it was missed that the second, unconditional,
wait_for_completion() was not optional and ensures the on-stack
completion is unused before going out-of-scope.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52704 to this issue.

===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.1 with commit f5d39b020809 and fixed in 6.1.13 with commit 7f9f6c54da87

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
