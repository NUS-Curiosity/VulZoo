Subject: CVE-2023-52907: nfc: pn533: Wait for out_urb's completion in pn533_usb_send_frame()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: pn533: Wait for out_urb's completion in pn533_usb_send_frame()

Fix a use-after-free that occurs in hcd when in_urb sent from
pn533_usb_send_frame() is completed earlier than out_urb. Its callback
frees the skb data in pn533_send_async_complete() that is used as a
transfer buffer of out_urb. Wait before sending in_urb until the
callback of out_urb is called. To modify the callback of out_urb alone,
separate the complete function of out_urb and ack_urb.

Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
