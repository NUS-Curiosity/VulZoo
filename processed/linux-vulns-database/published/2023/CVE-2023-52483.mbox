Subject: CVE-2023-52483: mctp: perform route lookups under a RCU read-side lock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mctp: perform route lookups under a RCU read-side lock

Our current route lookups (mctp_route_lookup and mctp_route_lookup_null)
traverse the net's route list without the RCU read lock held. This means
the route lookup is subject to preemption, resulting in an potential
grace period expiry, and so an eventual kfree() while we still have the
route pointer.

Add the proper read-side critical section locks around the route
lookups, preventing premption and a possible parallel kfree.

The remaining net->mctp.routes accesses are already under a
rcu_read_lock, or protected by the RTNL for updates.

Based on an analysis from Sili Luo <rootlab@huawei.com>, where
introducing a delay in the route lookup could cause a UAF on
simultaneous sendmsg() and route deletion.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52483 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
