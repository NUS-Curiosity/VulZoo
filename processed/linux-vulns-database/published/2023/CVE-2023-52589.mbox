Subject: CVE-2023-52589: media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ disable race issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ disable race issue

In rkisp1_isp_stop() and rkisp1_csi_disable() the driver masks the
interrupts and then apparently assumes that the interrupt handler won't
be running, and proceeds in the stop procedure. This is not the case, as
the interrupt handler can already be running, which would lead to the
ISP being disabled while the interrupt handler handling a captured
frame.

This brings up two issues: 1) the ISP could be powered off while the
interrupt handler is still running and accessing registers, leading to
board lockup, and 2) the interrupt handler code and the code that
disables the streaming might do things that conflict.

It is not clear to me if 2) causes a real issue, but 1) can be seen with
a suitable delay (or printk in my case) in the interrupt handler,
leading to board lockup.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52589 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
