Subject: CVE-2023-52455: iommu: Don't reserve 0-length IOVA region

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu: Don't reserve 0-length IOVA region

When the bootloader/firmware doesn't setup the framebuffers, their
address and size are 0 in "iommu-addresses" property. If IOVA region is
reserved with 0 length, then it ends up corrupting the IOVA rbtree with
an entry which has pfn_hi < pfn_lo.
If we intend to use display driver in kernel without framebuffer then
it's causing the display IOMMU mappings to fail as entire valid IOVA
space is reserved when address and length are passed as 0.
An ideal solution would be firmware removing the "iommu-addresses"
property and corresponding "memory-region" if display is not present.
But the kernel should be able to handle this by checking for size of
IOVA region and skipping the IOVA reservation if size is 0. Also, add
a warning if firmware is requesting 0-length IOVA region reservation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52455 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
