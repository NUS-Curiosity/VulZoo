Subject: CVE-2023-52568: x86/sgx: Resolves SECS reclaim vs. page fault for EAUG race

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/sgx: Resolves SECS reclaim vs. page fault for EAUG race

The SGX EPC reclaimer (ksgxd) may reclaim the SECS EPC page for an
enclave and set secs.epc_page to NULL. The SECS page is used for EAUG
and ELDU in the SGX page fault handler. However, the NULL check for
secs.epc_page is only done for ELDU, not EAUG before being used.

Fix this by doing the same NULL check and reloading of the SECS page as
needed for both EAUG and ELDU.

The SECS page holds global enclave metadata. It can only be reclaimed
when there are no other enclave pages remaining. At that point,
virtually nothing can be done with the enclave until the SECS page is
paged back in.

An enclave can not run nor generate page faults without a resident SECS
page. But it is still possible for a #PF for a non-SECS page to race
with paging out the SECS page: when the last resident non-SECS page A
triggers a #PF in a non-resident page B, and then page A and the SECS
both are paged out before the #PF on B is handled.

Hitting this bug requires that race triggered with a #PF for EAUG.
Following is a trace when it happens.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/811ba2ef0cb6402672e64ba1419d6ef95aa3405d
