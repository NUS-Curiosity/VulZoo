Subject: CVE-2023-52860: drivers/perf: hisi: use cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls() for hisi_hns3_pmu uninit process

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/perf: hisi: use cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls() for hisi_hns3_pmu uninit process

When tearing down a 'hisi_hns3' PMU, we mistakenly run the CPU hotplug
callbacks after the device has been unregistered, leading to fireworks
when we try to execute empty function callbacks within the driver:

  | Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000
  | CPU: 0 PID: 15 Comm: cpuhp/0 Tainted: G        W  O      5.12.0-rc4+ #1
  | Hardware name:  , BIOS KpxxxFPGA 1P B600 V143 04/22/2021
  | pstate: 80400009 (Nzcv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO BTYPE=--)
  | pc : perf_pmu_migrate_context+0x98/0x38c
  | lr : perf_pmu_migrate_context+0x94/0x38c
  |
  | Call trace:
  |  perf_pmu_migrate_context+0x98/0x38c
  |  hisi_hns3_pmu_offline_cpu+0x104/0x12c [hisi_hns3_pmu]

Use cpuhp_state_remove_instance_nocalls() instead of
cpuhp_state_remove_instance() so that the notifiers don't execute after
the PMU device has been unregistered.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
