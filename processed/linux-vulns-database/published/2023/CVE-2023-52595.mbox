Subject: CVE-2023-52595: wifi: rt2x00: restart beacon queue when hardware reset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rt2x00: restart beacon queue when hardware reset

When a hardware reset is triggered, all registers are reset, so all
queues are forced to stop in hardware interface. However, mac80211
will not automatically stop the queue. If we don't manually stop the
beacon queue, the queue will be deadlocked and unable to start again.
This patch fixes the issue where Apple devices cannot connect to the
AP after calling ieee80211_restart_hw().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52595 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
