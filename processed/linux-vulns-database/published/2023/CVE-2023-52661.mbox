Subject: CVE-2023-52661: drm/tegra: rgb: Fix missing clk_put() in the error handling paths of tegra_dc_rgb_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/tegra: rgb: Fix missing clk_put() in the error handling paths of tegra_dc_rgb_probe()

If clk_get_sys(..., "pll_d2_out0") fails, the clk_get_sys() call must be
undone.

Add the missing clk_put and a new 'put_pll_d_out0' label in the error
handling path, and use it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52661 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
