Subject: CVE-2023-52752: smb: client: fix use-after-free bug in cifs_debug_data_proc_show()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix use-after-free bug in cifs_debug_data_proc_show()

Skip SMB sessions that are being teared down
(e.g. @ses->ses_status == SES_EXITING) in cifs_debug_data_proc_show()
to avoid use-after-free in @ses.

This fixes the following GPF when reading from /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData
while mounting and umounting

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
