Subject: CVE-2023-52878: can: dev: can_put_echo_skb(): don't crash kernel if can_priv::echo_skb is accessed out of bounds

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: dev: can_put_echo_skb(): don't crash kernel if can_priv::echo_skb is accessed out of bounds

If the "struct can_priv::echoo_skb" is accessed out of bounds, this
would cause a kernel crash. Instead, issue a meaningful warning
message and return with an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52878 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
