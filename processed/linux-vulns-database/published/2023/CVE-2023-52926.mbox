Subject: CVE-2023-52926: io_uring/rw: split io_read() into a helper

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IORING_OP_READ did not correctly consume the provided buffer list when
read i/o returned < 0 (except for -EAGAIN and -EIOCBQUEUED return).
This can lead to a potential use-after-free when the completion via
io_rw_done runs at separate context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52926 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
