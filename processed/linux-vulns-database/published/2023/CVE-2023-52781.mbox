Subject: CVE-2023-52781: usb: config: fix iteration issue in 'usb_get_bos_descriptor()'

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: config: fix iteration issue in 'usb_get_bos_descriptor()'

The BOS descriptor defines a root descriptor and is the base descriptor for
accessing a family of related descriptors.

Function 'usb_get_bos_descriptor()' encounters an iteration issue when
skipping the 'USB_DT_DEVICE_CAPABILITY' descriptor type. This results in
the same descriptor being read repeatedly.

To address this issue, a 'goto' statement is introduced to ensure that the
pointer and the amount read is updated correctly. This ensures that the
function iterates to the next descriptor instead of reading the same
descriptor repeatedly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52781 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
