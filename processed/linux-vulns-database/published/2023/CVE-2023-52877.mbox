Subject: CVE-2023-52877: usb: typec: tcpm: Fix NULL pointer dereference in tcpm_pd_svdm()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: tcpm: Fix NULL pointer dereference in tcpm_pd_svdm()

It is possible that typec_register_partner() returns ERR_PTR on failure.
When port->partner is an error, a NULL pointer dereference may occur as
shown below.

[91222.095236][  T319] typec port0: failed to register partner (-17)

Add a check for port->partner to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52877 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
