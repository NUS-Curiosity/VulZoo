Subject: CVE-2023-52638: can: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock

The following 3 locks would race against each other, causing the
deadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:

- j1939_socks_lock
- active_session_list_lock
- sk_session_queue_lock

A reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock, since in
the rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked list
that j1939_socks_lock is protecting, the code does not attempt to
acquire any more locks. This would break the circular lock dependency,
where, for example, the current thread already locks j1939_socks_lock
and attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock, and at the same time,
another thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holding
sk_session_queue_lock.

NOTE: This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug
reported by Syzbot; instead, it solves a deadlock situation to prepare
for one or more further patches to actually fix the Syzbot bug, which
appears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52638 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
