Subject: CVE-2023-52760: gfs2: Fix slab-use-after-free in gfs2_qd_dealloc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: Fix slab-use-after-free in gfs2_qd_dealloc

In gfs2_put_super(), whether withdrawn or not, the quota should
be cleaned up by gfs2_quota_cleanup().

Otherwise, struct gfs2_sbd will be freed before gfs2_qd_dealloc (rcu
callback) has run for all gfs2_quota_data objects, resulting in
use-after-free.

Also, gfs2_destroy_threads() and gfs2_quota_cleanup() is already called
by gfs2_make_fs_ro(), so in gfs2_put_super(), after calling
gfs2_make_fs_ro(), there is no need to call them again.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52760 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.6.3 with commit 08a28272faa7

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
