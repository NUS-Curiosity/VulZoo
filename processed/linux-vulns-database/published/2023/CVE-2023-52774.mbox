Subject: CVE-2023-52774: s390/dasd: protect device queue against concurrent access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/dasd: protect device queue against concurrent access

In dasd_profile_start() the amount of requests on the device queue are
counted. The access to the device queue is unprotected against
concurrent access. With a lot of parallel I/O, especially with alias
devices enabled, the device queue can change while dasd_profile_start()
is accessing the queue. In the worst case this leads to a kernel panic
due to incorrect pointer accesses.

Fix this by taking the device lock before accessing the queue and
counting the requests. Additionally the check for a valid profile data
pointer can be done earlier to avoid unnecessary locking in a hot path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52774 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
