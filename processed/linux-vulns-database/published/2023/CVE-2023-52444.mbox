Subject: CVE-2023-52444: f2fs: fix to avoid dirent corruption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid dirent corruption

As Al reported in link[1]:

f2fs_rename()
...
	if (old_dir != new_dir && !whiteout)
		f2fs_set_link(old_inode, old_dir_entry,
					old_dir_page, new_dir);
	else
		f2fs_put_page(old_dir_page, 0);

You want correct inumber in the ".." link.  And cross-directory
rename does move the source to new parent, even if you'd been asked
to leave a whiteout in the old place.

[1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231017055040.GN800259@ZenIV/

With below testcase, it may cause dirent corruption, due to it missed
to call f2fs_set_link() to update ".." link to new directory.
- mkdir -p dir/foo
- renameat2 -w dir/foo bar

[ASSERT] (__chk_dots_dentries:1421)  --> Bad inode number[0x4] for '..', parent parent ino is [0x3]
[FSCK] other corrupted bugs                           [Fail]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52444 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
