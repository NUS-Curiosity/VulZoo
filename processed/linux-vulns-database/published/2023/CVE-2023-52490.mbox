Subject: CVE-2023-52490: mm: migrate: fix getting incorrect page mapping during page migration

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: migrate: fix getting incorrect page mapping during page migration

When running stress-ng testing, we found below kernel crash after a few hours:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000

After analyzing the vmcore, I found this issue is caused by page migration.
The scenario is that, one thread is doing page migration, and we will use the
target page's ->mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and
page move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1.

Currently, there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It discovers that
the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the offline operation, thus
proceeding to dump the page. However, page_mapping() of the target page may
return an incorrect file mapping to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since
the target page->mapping only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.

There are seveval ways to fix this issue:
(1) Setting the PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the target
page has not built mappings yet.
(2) Getting the page lock to call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing
the system, however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction.
(3) Using target page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits
page state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can remove
the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a simple way.

So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also fix other potential
issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52490 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
