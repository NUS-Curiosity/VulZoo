Subject: CVE-2023-52810: fs/jfs: Add check for negative db_l2nbperpage

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/jfs: Add check for negative db_l2nbperpage

l2nbperpage is log2(number of blks per page), and the minimum legal
value should be 0, not negative.

In the case of l2nbperpage being negative, an error will occur
when subsequently used as shift exponent.

Syzbot reported this bug:

UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in fs/jfs/jfs_dmap.c:799:12
shift exponent -16777216 is negative

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52810 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
