Subject: CVE-2023-52853: hid: cp2112: Fix duplicate workqueue initialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hid: cp2112: Fix duplicate workqueue initialization

Previously the cp2112 driver called INIT_DELAYED_WORK within
cp2112_gpio_irq_startup, resulting in duplicate initilizations of the
workqueue on subsequent IRQ startups following an initial request. This
resulted in a warning in set_work_data in workqueue.c, as well as a rare
NULL dereference within process_one_work in workqueue.c.

Initialize the workqueue within _probe instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52853 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
