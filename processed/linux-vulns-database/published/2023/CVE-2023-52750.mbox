Subject: CVE-2023-52750: arm64: Restrict CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to GNU as or LLVM IAS 15.x or newer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: Restrict CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to GNU as or LLVM IAS 15.x or newer

Prior to LLVM 15.0.0, LLVM's integrated assembler would incorrectly
byte-swap NOP when compiling for big-endian, and the resulting series of
bytes happened to match the encoding of FNMADD S21, S30, S0, S0.

This went unnoticed until commit:

  34f66c4c4d5518c1 ("arm64: Use a positive cpucap for FP/SIMD")

Prior to that commit, the kernel would always enable the use of FPSIMD
early in boot when __cpu_setup() initialized CPACR_EL1, and so usage of
FNMADD within the kernel was not detected, but could result in the
corruption of user or kernel FPSIMD state.

After that commit, the instructions happen to trap during boot prior to
FPSIMD being detected and enabled, e.g.

Restrict CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN to a known good assembler, which is
either GNU as or LLVM's IAS 15.0.0 and newer, which contains the linked
commit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52750 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
