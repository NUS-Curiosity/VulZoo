Subject: CVE-2023-52628: netfilter: nftables: exthdr: fix 4-byte stack OOB write

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nftables: exthdr: fix 4-byte stack OOB write

If priv->len is a multiple of 4, then dst[len / 4] can write past
the destination array which leads to stack corruption.

This construct is necessary to clean the remainder of the register
in case ->len is NOT a multiple of the register size, so make it
conditional just like nft_payload.c does.

The bug was added in 4.1 cycle and then copied/inherited when
tcp/sctp and ip option support was added.

Bug reported by Zero Day Initiative project (ZDI-CAN-21950,
ZDI-CAN-21951, ZDI-CAN-21961).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52628 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
