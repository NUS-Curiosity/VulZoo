Subject: CVE-2023-52829: wifi: ath12k: fix possible out-of-bound write in ath12k_wmi_ext_hal_reg_caps()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix possible out-of-bound write in ath12k_wmi_ext_hal_reg_caps()

reg_cap.phy_id is extracted from WMI event and could be an unexpected value
in case some errors happen. As a result out-of-bound write may occur to
soc->hal_reg_cap. Fix it by validating reg_cap.phy_id before using it.

This is found during code review.

Compile tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52829 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
