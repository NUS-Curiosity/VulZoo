Subject: CVE-2023-52621: bpf: Check rcu_read_lock_trace_held() before calling bpf map helpers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Check rcu_read_lock_trace_held() before calling bpf map helpers

These three bpf_map_{lookup,update,delete}_elem() helpers are also
available for sleepable bpf program, so add the corresponding lock
assertion for sleepable bpf program, otherwise the following warning
will be reported when a sleepable bpf program manipulates bpf map under
interpreter mode (aka bpf_jit_enable=0):

  WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 4985 at kernel/bpf/helpers.c:40 ......

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
