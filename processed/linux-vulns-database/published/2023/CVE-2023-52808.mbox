Subject: CVE-2023-52808: scsi: hisi_sas: Set debugfs_dir pointer to NULL after removing debugfs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: hisi_sas: Set debugfs_dir pointer to NULL after removing debugfs

If init debugfs failed during device registration due to memory allocation
failure, debugfs_remove_recursive() is called, after which debugfs_dir is
not set to NULL. debugfs_remove_recursive() will be called again during
device removal. As a result, illegal pointer is accessed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
