Subject: CVE-2023-52629: sh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug

The original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync()
in switch_drv_remove(). Although we use flush_work() to stop
the worker, it could be rescheduled in switch_timer(). As a result,
a use-after-free bug can occur. The details are shown below:

      (cpu 0)                    |      (cpu 1)
switch_drv_remove()              |
 flush_work()                    |
  ...                            |  switch_timer // timer
                                 |   schedule_work(&psw->work)
 timer_shutdown_sync()           |
 ...                             |  switch_work_handler // worker
 kfree(psw) // free              |
                                 |   psw->state = 0 // use

This patch puts timer_shutdown_sync() before flush_work() to
mitigate the bugs. As a result, the worker and timer will be
stopped safely before the deallocate operations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52629 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/610dbd8ac271aa36080aac50b928d700ee3fe4de
