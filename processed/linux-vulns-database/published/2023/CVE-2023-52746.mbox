Subject: CVE-2023-52746: xfrm/compat: prevent potential spectre v1 gadget in xfrm_xlate32_attr()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfrm/compat: prevent potential spectre v1 gadget in xfrm_xlate32_attr()

  int type = nla_type(nla);

  if (type > XFRMA_MAX) {
            return -EOPNOTSUPP;
  }

@type is then used as an array index and can be used
as a Spectre v1 gadget.

  if (nla_len(nla) < compat_policy[type].len) {

array_index_nospec() can be used to prevent leaking
content of kernel memory to malicious users.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52746 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
