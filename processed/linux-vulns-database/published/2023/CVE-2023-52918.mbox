Subject: CVE-2023-52918: media: pci: cx23885: check cx23885_vdev_init() return

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: pci: cx23885: check cx23885_vdev_init() return

cx23885_vdev_init() can return a NULL pointer, but that pointer
is used in the next line without a check.

Add a NULL pointer check and go to the error unwind if it is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52918 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
