Subject: CVE-2023-52442: ksmbd: validate session id and tree id in compound request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: validate session id and tree id in compound request

`smb2_get_msg()` in smb2_get_ksmbd_tcon() and smb2_check_user_session()
will always return the first request smb2 header in a compound request.
if `SMB2_TREE_CONNECT_HE` is the first command in compound request, will
return 0, i.e. The tree id check is skipped.
This patch use ksmbd_req_buf_next() to get current command in compound.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52442 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
