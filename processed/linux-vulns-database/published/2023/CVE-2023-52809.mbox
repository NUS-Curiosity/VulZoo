Subject: CVE-2023-52809: scsi: libfc: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in fc_lport_ptp_setup()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: libfc: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in fc_lport_ptp_setup()

fc_lport_ptp_setup() did not check the return value of fc_rport_create()
which can return NULL and would cause a NULL pointer dereference. Address
this issue by checking return value of fc_rport_create() and log error
message on fc_rport_create() failed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52809 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
