Subject: CVE-2023-52861: drm: bridge: it66121: Fix invalid connector dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: bridge: it66121: Fix invalid connector dereference

Fix the NULL pointer dereference when no monitor is connected, and the
sound card is opened from userspace.

Instead return an empty buffer (of zeroes) as the EDID information to
the sound framework if there is no connector attached.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
