Subject: CVE-2023-52525: wifi: mwifiex: Fix oob check condition in mwifiex_process_rx_packet

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mwifiex: Fix oob check condition in mwifiex_process_rx_packet

Only skip the code path trying to access the rfc1042 headers when the
buffer is too small, so the driver can still process packets without
rfc1042 headers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52525 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
