Subject: CVE-2023-52582: netfs: Only call folio_start_fscache() one time for each folio

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Only call folio_start_fscache() one time for each folio

If a network filesystem using netfs implements a clamp_length()
function, it can set subrequest lengths smaller than a page size.

When we loop through the folios in netfs_rreq_unlock_folios() to
set any folios to be written back, we need to make sure we only
call folio_start_fscache() once for each folio.

Otherwise, this simple testcase:

  mount -o fsc,rsize=1024,wsize=1024 127.0.0.1:/export /mnt/nfs
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/nfs/file.bin bs=4096 count=1
  1+0 records in
  1+0 records out
  4096 bytes (4.1 kB, 4.0 KiB) copied, 0.0126359 s, 324 kB/s
  echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
  cat /mnt/nfs/file.bin > /dev/null

will trigger an oops similar to the following:

  page dumped because: VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO(folio_test_private_2(folio))

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
