Subject: CVE-2023-52559: iommu/vt-d: Avoid memory allocation in iommu_suspend()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Avoid memory allocation in iommu_suspend()

The iommu_suspend() syscore suspend callback is invoked with IRQ disabled.
Allocating memory with the GFP_KERNEL flag may re-enable IRQs during
the suspend callback, which can cause intermittent suspend/hibernation
problems with the following kernel traces:

Given that only 4 words memory is needed, avoid the memory allocation in
iommu_suspend().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52559 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
