Subject: CVE-2023-52811: scsi: ibmvfc: Remove BUG_ON in the case of an empty event pool

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ibmvfc: Remove BUG_ON in the case of an empty event pool

In practice the driver should never send more commands than are allocated
to a queue's event pool. In the unlikely event that this happens, the code
asserts a BUG_ON, and in the case that the kernel is not configured to
crash on panic returns a junk event pointer from the empty event list
causing things to spiral from there. This BUG_ON is a historical artifact
of the ibmvfc driver first being upstreamed, and it is well known now that
the use of BUG_ON is bad practice except in the most unrecoverable
scenario. There is nothing about this scenario that prevents the driver
from recovering and carrying on.

Remove the BUG_ON in question from ibmvfc_get_event() and return a NULL
pointer in the case of an empty event pool. Update all call sites to
ibmvfc_get_event() to check for a NULL pointer and perfrom the appropriate
failure or recovery action.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52811 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
