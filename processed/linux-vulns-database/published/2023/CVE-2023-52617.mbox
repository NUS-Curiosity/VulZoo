Subject: CVE-2023-52617: PCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove

A PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev->cdev is held open. The call
to stdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point way past
switchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish with the
trailing put_device(), just before return.

At that later point in time, the devm cleanup has already removed the
stdev->mmio_mrpc mapping. Also, the stdev->pdev reference was not a counted
one. Therefore, in DMA mode, the iowrite32() in stdev_release() will cause
a fatal page fault, and the subsequent dma_free_coherent(), if reached,
would pass a stale &stdev->pdev->dev pointer.

Fix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove(), after
stdev_kill(). Counting the stdev->pdev ref is now optional, but may prevent
future accidents.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
