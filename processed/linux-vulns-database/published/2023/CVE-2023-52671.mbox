Subject: CVE-2023-52671: drm/amd/display: Fix hang/underflow when transitioning to ODM4:1

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix hang/underflow when transitioning to ODM4:1

[Why]
Under some circumstances, disabling an OPTC and attempting to reclaim
its OPP(s) for a different OPTC could cause a hang/underflow due to OPPs
not being properly disconnected from the disabled OPTC.

[How]
Ensure that all OPPs are unassigned from an OPTC when it gets disabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52671 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
