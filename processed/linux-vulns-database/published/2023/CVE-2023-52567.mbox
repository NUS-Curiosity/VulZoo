Subject: CVE-2023-52567: serial: 8250_port: Check IRQ data before use

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: 8250_port: Check IRQ data before use

In case the leaf driver wants to use IRQ polling (irq = 0) and
IIR register shows that an interrupt happened in the 8250 hardware
the IRQ data can be NULL. In such a case we need to skip the wake
event as we came to this path from the timer interrupt and quite
likely system is already awake.

Without this fix we have got an Oops:

    serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 0, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
    ...
    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010
    RIP: 0010:serial8250_handle_irq+0x7c/0x240
    Call Trace:
     ? serial8250_handle_irq+0x7c/0x240
     ? __pfx_serial8250_timeout+0x10/0x10

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52567 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
