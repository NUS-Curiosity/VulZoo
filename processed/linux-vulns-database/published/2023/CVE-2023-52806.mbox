Subject: CVE-2023-52806: ALSA: hda: Fix possible null-ptr-deref when assigning a stream

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: Fix possible null-ptr-deref when assigning a stream

While AudioDSP drivers assign streams exclusively of HOST or LINK type,
nothing blocks a user to attempt to assign a COUPLED stream. As
supplied substream instance may be a stub, what is the case when
code-loading, such scenario ends with null-ptr-deref.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52806 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
