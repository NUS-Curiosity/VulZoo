Subject: CVE-2023-52663: ASoC: SOF: amd: Fix memory leak in amd_sof_acp_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: amd: Fix memory leak in amd_sof_acp_probe()

Driver uses kasprintf() to initialize fw_{code,data}_bin members of
struct acp_dev_data, but kfree() is never called to deallocate the
memory, which results in a memory leak.

Fix the issue by switching to devm_kasprintf(). Additionally, ensure the
allocation was successful by checking the pointer validity.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52663 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
