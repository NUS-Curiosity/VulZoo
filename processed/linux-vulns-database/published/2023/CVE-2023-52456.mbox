Subject: CVE-2023-52456: serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock

When using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to
control the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the
TTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during
userland application crash), imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface
and disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that,
imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission, to be retriggered
by the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx
statemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in
deadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making the interface useless.

imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC
interrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure
the state machine handling is reached, and is properly set to
WAIT_AFTER_SEND.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52456 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
