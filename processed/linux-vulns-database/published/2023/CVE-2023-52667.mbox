Subject: CVE-2023-52667: net/mlx5e: fix a potential double-free in fs_any_create_groups

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: fix a potential double-free in fs_any_create_groups

When kcalloc() for ft->g succeeds but kvzalloc() for in fails,
fs_any_create_groups() will free ft->g. However, its caller
fs_any_create_table() will free ft->g again through calling
mlx5e_destroy_flow_table(), which will lead to a double-free.
Fix this by setting ft->g to NULL in fs_any_create_groups().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52667 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
