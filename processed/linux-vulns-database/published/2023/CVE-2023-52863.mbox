Subject: CVE-2023-52863: hwmon: (axi-fan-control) Fix possible NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (axi-fan-control) Fix possible NULL pointer dereference

axi_fan_control_irq_handler(), dependent on the private
axi_fan_control_data structure, might be called before the hwmon
device is registered. That will cause an "Unable to handle kernel
NULL pointer dereference" error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52863 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
