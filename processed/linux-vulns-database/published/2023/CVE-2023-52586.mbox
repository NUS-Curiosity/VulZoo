Subject: CVE-2023-52586: drm/msm/dpu: Add mutex lock in control vblank irq

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: Add mutex lock in control vblank irq

Add a mutex lock to control vblank irq to synchronize vblank
enable/disable operations happening from different threads to prevent
race conditions while registering/unregistering the vblank irq callback.

v4: -Removed vblank_ctl_lock from dpu_encoder_virt, so it is only a
    parameter of dpu_encoder_phys.
    -Switch from atomic refcnt to a simple int counter as mutex has
    now been added
v3: Mistakenly did not change wording in last version. It is done now.
v2: Slightly changed wording of commit message

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
