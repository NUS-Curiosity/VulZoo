Subject: CVE-2023-52504: x86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives()

Fei has reported that KASAN triggers during apply_alternatives() on
a 5-level paging machine:

	BUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in rcu_is_watching()
	Read of size 4 at addr ff110003ee6419a0 by task swapper/0/0
	...
	__asan_load4()
	rcu_is_watching()
	trace_hardirqs_on()
	text_poke_early()
	apply_alternatives()
	...

On machines with 5-level paging, cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57)
gets patched. It includes KASAN code, where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on
__VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT, which is defined with cpu_feature_enabled().

KASAN gets confused when apply_alternatives() patches the
KASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test patch that makes KASAN_SHADOW_START
static, by replacing __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56, works around the issue.

Fix it for real by disabling KASAN while the kernel is patching alternatives.

[ mingo: updated the changelog ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52504 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
