Subject: CVE-2023-52902: nommu: fix memory leak in do_mmap() error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nommu: fix memory leak in do_mmap() error path

The preallocation of the maple tree nodes may leak if the error path to
"error_just_free" is taken.  Fix this by moving the freeing of the maple
tree nodes to a shared location for all error paths.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52902 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
