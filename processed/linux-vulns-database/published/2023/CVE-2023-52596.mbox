Subject: CVE-2023-52596: sysctl: Fix out of bounds access for empty sysctl registers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sysctl: Fix out of bounds access for empty sysctl registers

When registering tables to the sysctl subsystem there is a check to see
if header is a permanently empty directory (used for mounts). This check
evaluates the first element of the ctl_table. This results in an out of
bounds evaluation when registering empty directories.

The function register_sysctl_mount_point now passes a ctl_table of size
1 instead of size 0. It now relies solely on the type to identify
a permanently empty register.

Make sure that the ctl_table has at least one element before testing for
permanent emptiness.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52596 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
