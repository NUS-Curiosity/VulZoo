Subject: CVE-2023-52492: dmaengine: fix NULL pointer in channel unregistration function

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: fix NULL pointer in channel unregistration function

__dma_async_device_channel_register() can fail. In case of failure,
chan->local is freed (with free_percpu()), and chan->local is nullified.
When dma_async_device_unregister() is called (because of managed API or
intentionally by DMA controller driver), channels are unconditionally
unregistered, leading to this NULL pointer:
[    1.318693] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000d0
[...]
[    1.484499] Call trace:
[    1.486930]  device_del+0x40/0x394
[    1.490314]  device_unregister+0x20/0x7c
[    1.494220]  __dma_async_device_channel_unregister+0x68/0xc0

Look at dma_async_device_register() function error path, channel device
unregistration is done only if chan->local is not NULL.

Then add the same condition at the beginning of
__dma_async_device_channel_unregister() function, to avoid NULL pointer
issue whatever the API used to reach this function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52492 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
