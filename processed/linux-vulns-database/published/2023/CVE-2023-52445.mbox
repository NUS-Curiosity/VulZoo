Subject: CVE-2023-52445: media: pvrusb2: fix use after free on context disconnection

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: pvrusb2: fix use after free on context disconnection

Upon module load, a kthread is created targeting the
pvr2_context_thread_func function, which may call pvr2_context_destroy
and thus call kfree() on the context object. However, that might happen
before the usb hub_event handler is able to notify the driver. This
patch adds a sanity check before the invalid read reported by syzbot,
within the context disconnection call stack.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52445 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
