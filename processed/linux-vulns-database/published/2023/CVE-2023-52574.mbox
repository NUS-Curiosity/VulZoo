Subject: CVE-2023-52574: team: fix null-ptr-deref when team device type is changed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

team: fix null-ptr-deref when team device type is changed

Get a null-ptr-deref bug as follows with reproducer [1].

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000228

When enslave a vlan device to team device and team device type is changed
from non-ether to ether, header_ops of team device is changed to
vlan_header_ops. That is incorrect and will trigger null-ptr-deref
for vlan->real_dev in vlan_dev_hard_header() because team device is not
a vlan device.

Cache eth_header_ops in team_setup(), then assign cached header_ops to
header_ops of team net device when its type is changed from non-ether
to ether to fix the bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52574 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
