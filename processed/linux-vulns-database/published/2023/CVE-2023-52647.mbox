Subject: CVE-2023-52647: media: nxp: imx8-isi: Check whether crossbar pad is non-NULL before access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: nxp: imx8-isi: Check whether crossbar pad is non-NULL before access

When translating source to sink streams in the crossbar subdev, the
driver tries to locate the remote subdev connected to the sink pad. The
remote pad may be NULL, if userspace tries to enable a stream that ends
at an unconnected crossbar sink. When that occurs, the driver
dereferences the NULL pad, leading to a crash.

Prevent the crash by checking if the pad is NULL before using it, and
return an error if it is.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52647 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
