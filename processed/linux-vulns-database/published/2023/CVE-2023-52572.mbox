Subject: CVE-2023-52572: cifs: Fix UAF in cifs_demultiplex_thread()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix UAF in cifs_demultiplex_thread()

There is a UAF when xfstests on cifs:

1. After send request to server, wait the response until
    mid->mid_state != SUBMITTED;
2. Receive response from server, and set it to mid;
3. Set the mid state to RECEIVED;
4. Kill the process, the mid state already RECEIVED, get 0;
5. Handle and release the negotiate response;
6. UAF.

It can be easily reproduce with add some delay in [3] - [6].

Only sync call has the problem since async call's callback is
executed in cifsd process.

Add an extra state to mark the mid state to READY before wakeup the
waitter, then it can get the resp safely.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52572 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
