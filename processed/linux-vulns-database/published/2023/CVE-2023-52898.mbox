Subject: CVE-2023-52898: xhci: Fix null pointer dereference when host dies

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xhci: Fix null pointer dereference when host dies

Make sure xhci_free_dev() and xhci_kill_endpoint_urbs() do not race
and cause null pointer dereference when host suddenly dies.

Usb core may call xhci_free_dev() which frees the xhci->devs[slot_id]
virt device at the same time that xhci_kill_endpoint_urbs() tries to
loop through all the device's endpoints, checking if there are any
cancelled urbs left to give back.

hold the xhci spinlock while freeing the virt device

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52898 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
