Subject: CVE-2023-52508: nvme-fc: Prevent null pointer dereference in nvme_fc_io_getuuid()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-fc: Prevent null pointer dereference in nvme_fc_io_getuuid()

The nvme_fc_fcp_op structure describing an AEN operation is initialized with a
null request structure pointer. An FC LLDD may make a call to
nvme_fc_io_getuuid passing a pointer to an nvmefc_fcp_req for an AEN operation.

Add validation of the request structure pointer before dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52508 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
