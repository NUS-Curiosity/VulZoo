Subject: CVE-2023-52450: perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix NULL pointer dereference issue in upi_fill_topology()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix NULL pointer dereference issue in upi_fill_topology()

Get logical socket id instead of physical id in discover_upi_topology()
to avoid out-of-bound access on 'upi = &type->topology[nid][idx];' line
that leads to NULL pointer dereference in upi_fill_topology()

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
