Subject: CVE-2022-48863: mISDN: Fix memory leak in dsp_pipeline_build()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mISDN: Fix memory leak in dsp_pipeline_build()

dsp_pipeline_build() allocates dup pointer by kstrdup(cfg),
but then it updates dup variable by strsep(&dup, "|").
As a result when it calls kfree(dup), the dup variable contains NULL.

Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48863 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
