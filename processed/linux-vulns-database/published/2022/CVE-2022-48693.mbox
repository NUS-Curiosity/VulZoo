Subject: CVE-2022-48693: soc: brcmstb: pm-arm: Fix refcount leak and __iomem leak bugs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: brcmstb: pm-arm: Fix refcount leak and __iomem leak bugs

In brcmstb_pm_probe(), there are two kinds of leak bugs:

(1) we need to add of_node_put() when for_each__matching_node() breaks
(2) we need to add iounmap() for each iomap in fail path

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48693 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
