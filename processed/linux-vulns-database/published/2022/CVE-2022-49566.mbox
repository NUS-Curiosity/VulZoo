Subject: CVE-2022-49566: crypto: qat - fix memory leak in RSA

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qat - fix memory leak in RSA

When an RSA key represented in form 2 (as defined in PKCS #1 V2.1) is
used, some components of the private key persist even after the TFM is
released.
Replace the explicit calls to free the buffers in qat_rsa_exit_tfm()
with a call to qat_rsa_clear_ctx() which frees all buffers referenced in
the TFM context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49566 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
