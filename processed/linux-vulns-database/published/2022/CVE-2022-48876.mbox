Subject: CVE-2022-48876: wifi: mac80211: fix initialization of rx->link and rx->link_sta

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix initialization of rx->link and rx->link_sta

There are some codepaths that do not initialize rx->link_sta properly. This
causes a crash in places which assume that rx->link_sta is valid if rx->sta
is valid.
One known instance is triggered by __ieee80211_rx_h_amsdu being called from
fast-rx. It results in a crash like this one:

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000a8

Since the initialization of rx->link and rx->link_sta is rather convoluted
and duplicated in many places, clean it up by using a helper function to
set it.

[remove unnecessary rx->sta->sta.mlo check]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48876 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a57c981d9f24d2bd89eaa76dc477e8ca252e22e8
