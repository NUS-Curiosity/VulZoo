Subject: CVE-2022-49316: NFSv4: Don't hold the layoutget locks across multiple RPC calls

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSv4: Don't hold the layoutget locks across multiple RPC calls

When doing layoutget as part of the open() compound, we have to be
careful to release the layout locks before we can call any further RPC
calls, such as setattr(). The reason is that those calls could trigger
a recall, which could deadlock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49316 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
