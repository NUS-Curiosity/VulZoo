Subject: CVE-2022-49477: ASoC: samsung: Fix refcount leak in aries_audio_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: samsung: Fix refcount leak in aries_audio_probe

of_parse_phandle() returns a node pointer with refcount
incremented, we should use of_node_put() on it when done.
If extcon_find_edev_by_node() fails, it doesn't call of_node_put()
Calling of_node_put() after extcon_find_edev_by_node() to fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49477 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
