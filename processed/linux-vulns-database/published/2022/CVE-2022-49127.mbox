Subject: CVE-2022-49127: ref_tracker: implement use-after-free detection

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ref_tracker: implement use-after-free detection

Whenever ref_tracker_dir_init() is called, mark the struct ref_tracker_dir
as dead.

Test the dead status from ref_tracker_alloc() and ref_tracker_free()

This should detect buggy dev_put()/dev_hold() happening too late
in netdevice dismantle process.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49127 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
