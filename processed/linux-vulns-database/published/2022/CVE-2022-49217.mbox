Subject: CVE-2022-49217: scsi: pm8001: Fix abort all task initialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm8001: Fix abort all task initialization

In pm80xx_send_abort_all(), the n_elem field of the ccb used is not
initialized to 0. This missing initialization sometimes lead to the task
completion path seeing the ccb with a non-zero n_elem resulting in the
execution of invalid dma_unmap_sg() calls in pm8001_ccb_task_free(),
causing a crash such as:

Avoid this issue by always initializing the ccb n_elem field to 0 in
pm8001_send_abort_all(), pm8001_send_read_log() and
pm80xx_send_abort_all().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49217 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
