Subject: CVE-2022-49455: misc: ocxl: fix possible double free in ocxl_file_register_afu

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: ocxl: fix possible double free in ocxl_file_register_afu

info_release() will be called in device_unregister() when info->dev's
reference count is 0. So there is no need to call ocxl_afu_put() and
kfree() again.

Fix this by adding free_minor() and return to err_unregister error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49455 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
