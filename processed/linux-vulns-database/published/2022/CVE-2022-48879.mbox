Subject: CVE-2022-48879: efi: fix NULL-deref in init error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi: fix NULL-deref in init error path

In cases where runtime services are not supported or have been disabled,
the runtime services workqueue will never have been allocated.

Do not try to destroy the workqueue unconditionally in the unlikely
event that EFI initialisation fails to avoid dereferencing a NULL
pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48879 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
