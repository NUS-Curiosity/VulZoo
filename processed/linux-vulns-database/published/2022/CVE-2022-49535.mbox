Subject: CVE-2022-49535: scsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference after failing to issue FLOGI and PLOGI

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix null pointer dereference after failing to issue FLOGI and PLOGI

If lpfc_issue_els_flogi() fails and returns non-zero status, the node
reference count is decremented to trigger the release of the nodelist
structure. However, if there is a prior registration or dev-loss-evt work
pending, the node may be released prematurely.  When dev-loss-evt
completes, the released node is referenced causing a use-after-free null
pointer dereference.

Similarly, when processing non-zero ELS PLOGI completion status in
lpfc_cmpl_els_plogi(), the ndlp flags are checked for a transport
registration before triggering node removal.  If dev-loss-evt work is
pending, the node may be released prematurely and a subsequent call to
lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_handler() results in a use after free ndlp dereference.

Add test for pending dev-loss before decrementing the node reference count
for FLOGI, PLOGI, PRLI, and ADISC handling.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49535 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_els.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10663ebec0ad5c78493a0dd34c9ee4d73d7ca0df
