Subject: CVE-2022-49479: mt76: fix tx status related use-after-free race on station removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mt76: fix tx status related use-after-free race on station removal

There is a small race window where ongoing tx activity can lead to a skb
getting added to the status tracking idr after that idr has already been
cleaned up, which will keep the wcid linked in the status poll list.
Fix this by only adding status skbs if the wcid pointer is still assigned
in dev->wcid, which gets cleared early by mt76_sta_pre_rcu_remove

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49479 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
