Subject: CVE-2022-49226: net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: asix: add proper error handling of usb read errors

Syzbot once again hit uninit value in asix driver. The problem still the
same -- asix_read_cmd() reads less bytes, than was requested by caller.

Since all read requests are performed via asix_read_cmd() let's catch
usb related error there and add __must_check notation to be sure all
callers actually check return value.

So, this patch adds sanity check inside asix_read_cmd(), that simply
checks if bytes read are not less, than was requested and adds missing
error handling of asix_read_cmd() all across the driver code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49226 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
