Subject: CVE-2022-49732: sock: redo the psock vs ULP protection check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sock: redo the psock vs ULP protection check

Commit 8a59f9d1e3d4 ("sock: Introduce sk->sk_prot->psock_update_sk_prot()")
has moved the inet_csk_has_ulp(sk) check from sk_psock_init() to
the new tcp_bpf_update_proto() function. I'm guessing that this
was done to allow creating psocks for non-inet sockets.

Unfortunately the destruction path for psock includes the ULP
unwind, so we need to fail the sk_psock_init() itself.
Otherwise if ULP is already present we'll notice that later,
and call tcp_update_ulp() with the sk_proto of the ULP
itself, which will most likely result in the ULP looping
its callbacks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49732 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
