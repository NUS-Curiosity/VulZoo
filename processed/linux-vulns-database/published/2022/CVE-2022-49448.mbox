Subject: CVE-2022-49448: soc: bcm: Check for NULL return of devm_kzalloc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: bcm: Check for NULL return of devm_kzalloc()

As the potential failure of allocation, devm_kzalloc() may return NULL.  Then
the 'pd->pmb' and the follow lines of code may bring null pointer dereference.

Therefore, it is better to check the return value of devm_kzalloc() to avoid
this confusion.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49448 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
