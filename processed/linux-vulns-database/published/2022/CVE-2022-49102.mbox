Subject: CVE-2022-49102: habanalabs: fix possible memory leak in MMU DR fini

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

habanalabs: fix possible memory leak in MMU DR fini

This patch fixes what seems to be copy paste error.

We will have a memory leak if the host-resident shadow is NULL (which
will likely happen as the DR and HR are not dependent).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49102 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
