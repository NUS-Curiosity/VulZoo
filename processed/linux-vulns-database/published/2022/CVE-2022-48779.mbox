Subject: CVE-2022-48779: net: mscc: ocelot: fix use-after-free in ocelot_vlan_del()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mscc: ocelot: fix use-after-free in ocelot_vlan_del()

ocelot_vlan_member_del() will free the struct ocelot_bridge_vlan, so if
this is the same as the port's pvid_vlan which we access afterwards,
what we're accessing is freed memory.

Fix the bug by determining whether to clear ocelot_port->pvid_vlan prior
to calling ocelot_vlan_member_del().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48779 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
