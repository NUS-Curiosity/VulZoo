Subject: CVE-2022-49511: fbdev: defio: fix the pagelist corruption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: defio: fix the pagelist corruption

Easily hit the below list corruption:
==
list_add corruption. prev->next should be next (ffffffffc0ceb090), but
was ffffec604507edc8. (prev=ffffec604507edc8).

Figure out the race happens when one process is adding &page->lru into
the pagelist tail in fb_deferred_io_mkwrite(), another process is
re-initializing the same &page->lru in fb_deferred_io_fault(), which is
not protected by the lock.

This fix is to init all the page lists one time during initialization,
it not only fixes the list corruption, but also avoids INIT_LIST_HEAD()
redundantly.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
