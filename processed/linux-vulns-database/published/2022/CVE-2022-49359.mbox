Subject: CVE-2022-49359: drm/panfrost: Job should reference MMU not file_priv

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panfrost: Job should reference MMU not file_priv

For a while now it's been allowed for a MMU context to outlive it's
corresponding panfrost_priv, however the job structure still references
panfrost_priv to get hold of the MMU context. If panfrost_priv has been
freed this is a use-after-free which I've been able to trigger resulting
in a splat.

To fix this, drop the reference to panfrost_priv in the job structure
and add a direct reference to the MMU structure which is what's actually
needed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49359 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
