Subject: CVE-2022-49523: ath11k: disable spectral scan during spectral deinit

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ath11k: disable spectral scan during spectral deinit

When ath11k modules are removed using rmmod with spectral scan enabled,
crash is observed. Different crash trace is observed for each crash.

Send spectral scan disable WMI command to firmware before cleaning
the spectral dbring in the spectral_deinit API to avoid this crash.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
