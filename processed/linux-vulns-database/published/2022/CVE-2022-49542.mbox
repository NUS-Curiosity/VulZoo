Subject: CVE-2022-49542: scsi: lpfc: Move cfg_log_verbose check before calling lpfc_dmp_dbg()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Move cfg_log_verbose check before calling lpfc_dmp_dbg()

In an attempt to log message 0126 with LOG_TRACE_EVENT, the following hard
lockup call trace hangs the system.

Call Trace:
 _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x32/0x40

Kernel panic - not syncing: Hard LOCKUP

The same CPU tries to claim the phba->port_list_lock twice.

Move the cfg_log_verbose checks as part of the lpfc_printf_vlog() and
lpfc_printf_log() macros before calling lpfc_dmp_dbg().  There is no need
to take the phba->port_list_lock within lpfc_dmp_dbg().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49542 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
