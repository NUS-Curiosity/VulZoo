Subject: CVE-2022-49533: ath11k: Change max no of active probe SSID and BSSID to fw capability

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ath11k: Change max no of active probe SSID and BSSID to fw capability

The maximum number of SSIDs in a for active probe requests is currently
reported as 16 (WLAN_SCAN_PARAMS_MAX_SSID) when registering the driver.
The scan_req_params structure only has the capacity to hold 10 SSIDs.
This leads to a buffer overflow which can be triggered from
wpa_supplicant in userspace. When copying the SSIDs into the
scan_req_params structure in the ath11k_mac_op_hw_scan route, it can
overwrite the extraie pointer.

Firmware supports 16 ssid * 4 bssid, for each ssid 4 bssid combo probe
request will be sent, so totally 64 probe requests supported. So
set both max ssid and bssid to 16 and 4 respectively. Remove the
redundant macros of ssid and bssid.

Tested-on: IPQ8074 hw2.0 AHB WLAN.HK.2.7.0.1-01300-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49533 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
