Subject: CVE-2022-49058: cifs: potential buffer overflow in handling symlinks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: potential buffer overflow in handling symlinks

Smatch printed a warning:
	arch/x86/crypto/poly1305_glue.c:198 poly1305_update_arch() error:
	__memcpy() 'dctx->buf' too small (16 vs u32max)

It's caused because Smatch marks 'link_len' as untrusted since it comes
from sscanf(). Add a check to ensure that 'link_len' is not larger than
the size of the 'link_str' buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49058 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
