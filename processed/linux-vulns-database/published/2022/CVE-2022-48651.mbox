Subject: CVE-2022-48651: ipvlan: Fix out-of-bound bugs caused by unset skb->mac_header

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipvlan: Fix out-of-bound bugs caused by unset skb->mac_header

If an AF_PACKET socket is used to send packets through ipvlan and the
default xmit function of the AF_PACKET socket is changed from
dev_queue_xmit() to packet_direct_xmit() via setsockopt() with the option
name of PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS, the skb->mac_header may not be reset and
remains as the initial value of 65535, this may trigger slab-out-of-bounds
bugs as following:

=================================================================
UG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2+0xdb/0x330 [ipvlan]

entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd

The root cause is:
  1. packet_snd() only reset skb->mac_header when sock->type is SOCK_RAW
     and skb->protocol is not specified as in packet_parse_headers()

  2. packet_direct_xmit() doesn't reset skb->mac_header as dev_queue_xmit()

In this case, skb->mac_header is 65535 when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() is
called. So when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() gets mac header with eth_hdr() which
use "skb->head + skb->mac_header", out-of-bound access occurs.

This patch replaces eth_hdr() with skb_eth_hdr() in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2()
and reset mac header in multicast to solve this out-of-bound bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48651 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
