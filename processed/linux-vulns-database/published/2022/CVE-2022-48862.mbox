Subject: CVE-2022-48862: vhost: fix hung thread due to erroneous iotlb entries

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vhost: fix hung thread due to erroneous iotlb entries

In vhost_iotlb_add_range_ctx(), range size can overflow to 0 when
start is 0 and last is ULONG_MAX. One instance where it can happen
is when userspace sends an IOTLB message with iova=size=uaddr=0
(vhost_process_iotlb_msg). So, an entry with size = 0, start = 0,
last = ULONG_MAX ends up in the iotlb. Next time a packet is sent,
iotlb_access_ok() loops indefinitely due to that erroneous entry.

	Call Trace:
	 <TASK>
	 iotlb_access_ok+0x21b/0x3e0 drivers/vhost/vhost.c:1340

To fix this, do two things:

1. Return -EINVAL in vhost_chr_write_iter() when userspace asks to map
   a range with size 0.
2. Fix vhost_iotlb_add_range_ctx() to handle the range [0, ULONG_MAX]
   by splitting it into two entries.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48862 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f8d88e86e90ea1002226d7ac2430152bfea003d1
