Subject: CVE-2022-48773: xprtrdma: fix pointer derefs in error cases of rpcrdma_ep_create

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xprtrdma: fix pointer derefs in error cases of rpcrdma_ep_create

If there are failures then we must not leave the non-NULL pointers with
the error value, otherwise `rpcrdma_ep_destroy` gets confused and tries
free them, resulting in an Oops.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48773 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
