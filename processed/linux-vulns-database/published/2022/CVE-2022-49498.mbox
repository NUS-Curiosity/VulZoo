Subject: CVE-2022-49498: ALSA: pcm: Check for null pointer of pointer substream before dereferencing it

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: Check for null pointer of pointer substream before dereferencing it

Pointer substream is being dereferenced on the assignment of pointer card
before substream is being null checked with the macro PCM_RUNTIME_CHECK.
Although PCM_RUNTIME_CHECK calls BUG_ON, it still is useful to perform the
the pointer check before card is assigned.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49498 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
