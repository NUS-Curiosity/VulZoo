Subject: CVE-2022-49023: wifi: cfg80211: fix buffer overflow in elem comparison

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: fix buffer overflow in elem comparison

For vendor elements, the code here assumes that 5 octets
are present without checking. Since the element itself is
already checked to fit, we only need to check the length.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49023 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
