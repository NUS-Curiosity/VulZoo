Subject: CVE-2022-49089: IB/rdmavt: add lock to call to rvt_error_qp to prevent a race condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/rdmavt: add lock to call to rvt_error_qp to prevent a race condition

The documentation of the function rvt_error_qp says both r_lock and s_lock
need to be held when calling that function.  It also asserts using lockdep
that both of those locks are held.  However, the commit I referenced in
Fixes accidentally makes the call to rvt_error_qp in rvt_ruc_loopback no
longer covered by r_lock.  This results in the lockdep assertion failing
and also possibly in a race condition.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49089 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
