Subject: CVE-2022-49254: media: ti-vpe: cal: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in cal_ctx_v4l2_init_formats()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: ti-vpe: cal: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in cal_ctx_v4l2_init_formats()

In cal_ctx_v4l2_init_formats(), devm_kzalloc() is assigned to
ctx->active_fmt and there is a dereference of it after that, which could
lead to NULL pointer dereference on failure of devm_kzalloc().

Fix this bug by adding a NULL check of ctx->active_fmt.

This bug was found by a static analyzer.

Builds with 'make allyesconfig' show no new warnings, and our static
analyzer no longer warns about this code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49254 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
