Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/bpf/32: Fix Oops on tail call tests

This is a tentative to write above the stack. The problem is encoutered
with tests added by commit 38608ee7b690 ("bpf, tests: Add load store
test case for tail call")

This happens because tail call is done to a BPF prog with a different
stack_depth. At the time being, the stack is kept as is when the caller
tail calls its callee. But at exit, the callee restores the stack based
on its own properties. Therefore here, at each run, r1 is erroneously
increased by 32 - 16 = 16 bytes.

This was done that way in order to pass the tail call count from caller
to callee through the stack. As powerpc32 doesn't have a red zone in
the stack, it was necessary the maintain the stack as is for the tail
call. But it was not anticipated that the BPF frame size could be
different.

Let's take a new approach. Use register r4 to carry the tail call count
during the tail call, and save it into the stack at function entry if
required. This means the input parameter must be in r3, which is more
correct as it is a 32 bits parameter, then tail call better match with
normal BPF function entry, the down side being that we move that input
parameter back and forth between r3 and r4. That can be optimised later.

Doing that also has the advantage of maximising the common parts between
tail calls and a normal function exit.

With the fix, tail call tests are now successfull:

  test_bpf: #0 Tail call leaf jited:1 53 PASS
  test_bpf: #1 Tail call 2 jited:1 115 PASS
  test_bpf: #2 Tail call 3 jited:1 154 PASS
  test_bpf: #3 Tail call 4 jited:1 165 PASS
  test_bpf: #4 Tail call load/store leaf jited:1 101 PASS
  test_bpf: #5 Tail call load/store jited:1 141 PASS
  test_bpf: #6 Tail call error path, max count reached jited:1 994 PASS
  test_bpf: #7 Tail call count preserved across function calls jited:1 140975 PASS
  test_bpf: #8 Tail call error path, NULL target jited:1 110 PASS
  test_bpf: #9 Tail call error path, index out of range jited:1 69 PASS
  test_bpf: test_tail_calls: Summary: 10 PASSED, 0 FAILED, [10/10 JIT'ed]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/747a6e547240baaaf41874d27333b87b87cfd24c
