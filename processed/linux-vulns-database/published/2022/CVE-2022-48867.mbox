Subject: CVE-2022-48867: dmaengine: idxd: Prevent use after free on completion memory

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Prevent use after free on completion memory

On driver unload any pending descriptors are flushed at the
time the interrupt is freed:
idxd_dmaengine_drv_remove() ->
	drv_disable_wq() ->
		idxd_wq_free_irq() ->
			idxd_flush_pending_descs().

If there are any descriptors present that need to be flushed this
flow triggers a "not present" page fault as below:

 BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ff391c97c70c9040
 #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
 #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page

The address that triggers the fault is the address of the
descriptor that was freed moments earlier via:
drv_disable_wq()->idxd_wq_free_resources()

Fix the use after free by freeing the descriptors after any possible
usage. This is done after idxd_wq_reset() to ensure that the memory
remains accessible during possible completion writes by the device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48867 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b9e8e3fcfec625fc1c2f68f684448aeeb882625b
