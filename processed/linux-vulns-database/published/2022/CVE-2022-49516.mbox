Subject: CVE-2022-49516: ice: always check VF VSI pointer values

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: always check VF VSI pointer values

The ice_get_vf_vsi function can return NULL in some cases, such as if
handling messages during a reset where the VSI is being removed and
recreated.

Several places throughout the driver do not bother to check whether this
VSI pointer is valid. Static analysis tools maybe report issues because
they detect paths where a potentially NULL pointer could be dereferenced.

Fix this by checking the return value of ice_get_vf_vsi everywhere.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49516 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
