Subject: CVE-2022-48671: cgroup: Add missing cpus_read_lock() to cgroup_attach_task_all()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cgroup: Add missing cpus_read_lock() to cgroup_attach_task_all()

syzbot is hitting percpu_rwsem_assert_held(&cpu_hotplug_lock) warning at
cpuset_attach() [1], for commit 4f7e7236435ca0ab ("cgroup: Fix
threadgroup_rwsem <-> cpus_read_lock() deadlock") missed that
cpuset_attach() is also called from cgroup_attach_task_all().
Add cpus_read_lock() like what cgroup_procs_write_start() does.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48671 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
