Subject: CVE-2022-49645: drm/panfrost: Fix shrinker list corruption by madvise IOCTL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panfrost: Fix shrinker list corruption by madvise IOCTL

Calling madvise IOCTL twice on BO causes memory shrinker list corruption
and crashes kernel because BO is already on the list and it's added to
the list again, while BO should be removed from the list before it's
re-added. Fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49645 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
