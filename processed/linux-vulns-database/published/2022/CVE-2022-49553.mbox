Subject: CVE-2022-49553: fs/ntfs3: validate BOOT sectors_per_clusters

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: validate BOOT sectors_per_clusters

When the NTFS BOOT sectors_per_clusters field is > 0x80, it represents a
shift value.  Make sure that the shift value is not too large before using
it (NTFS max cluster size is 2MB).  Return -EVINVAL if it too large.

This prevents negative shift values and shift values that are larger than
the field size.

Prevents this UBSAN error:

 UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in ../fs/ntfs3/super.c:673:16
 shift exponent -192 is negative

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49553 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
