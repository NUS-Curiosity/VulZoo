Subject: CVE-2022-48952: PCI: mt7621: Add sentinel to quirks table

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: mt7621: Add sentinel to quirks table

Current driver is missing a sentinel in the struct soc_device_attribute
array, which causes an oops when assessed by the
soc_device_match(mt7621_pcie_quirks_match) call.

This was only exposed once the CONFIG_SOC_MT7621 mt7621 soc_dev_attr
was fixed to register the SOC as a device, in:

commit 7c18b64bba3b ("mips: ralink: mt7621: do not use kzalloc too early")

Fix it by adding the required sentinel.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48952 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
