Subject: CVE-2022-49501: usbnet: Run unregister_netdev() before unbind() again

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usbnet: Run unregister_netdev() before unbind() again

Commit 2c9d6c2b871d ("usbnet: run unbind() before unregister_netdev()")
sought to fix a use-after-free on disconnect of USB Ethernet adapters.

It turns out that a different fix is necessary to address the issue:
https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/18b3541e5372bc9b9fc733d422f4e698c089077c.1650177997.git.lukas@wunner.de/

So the commit was not necessary.

The commit made binding and unbinding of USB Ethernet asymmetrical:
Before, usbnet_probe() first invoked the ->bind() callback and then
register_netdev().  usbnet_disconnect() mirrored that by first invoking
unregister_netdev() and then ->unbind().

Since the commit, the order in usbnet_disconnect() is reversed and no
longer mirrors usbnet_probe().

One consequence is that a PHY disconnected (and stopped) in ->unbind()
is afterwards stopped once more by unregister_netdev() as it closes the
netdev before unregistering.  That necessitates a contortion in ->stop()
because the PHY may only be stopped if it hasn't already been
disconnected.

Reverting the commit allows making the call to phy_stop() unconditional
in ->stop().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49501 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
