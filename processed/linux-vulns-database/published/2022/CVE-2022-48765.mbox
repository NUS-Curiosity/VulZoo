Subject: CVE-2022-48765: KVM: LAPIC: Also cancel preemption timer during SET_LAPIC

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: LAPIC: Also cancel preemption timer during SET_LAPIC

The below warning is splatting during guest reboot.

  ------------[ cut here ]------------
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1931 at arch/x86/kvm/x86.c:10322 kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm]
  CPU: 0 PID: 1931 Comm: qemu-system-x86 Tainted: G          I       5.17.0-rc1+ #5
  RIP: 0010:kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run+0x874/0x880 [kvm]
  Call Trace:

This can be triggered by not exposing tsc-deadline mode and doing a reboot in
the guest. The lapic_shutdown() function which is called in sys_reboot path
will not disarm the flying timer, it just masks LVTT. lapic_shutdown() clears
APIC state w/ LVT_MASKED and timer-mode bit is 0, this can trigger timer-mode
switch between tsc-deadline and oneshot/periodic, which can result in preemption
timer be cancelled in apic_update_lvtt(). However, We can't depend on this when
not exposing tsc-deadline mode and oneshot/periodic modes emulated by preemption
timer. Qemu will synchronise states around reset, let's cancel preemption timer
under KVM_SET_LAPIC.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48765 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
