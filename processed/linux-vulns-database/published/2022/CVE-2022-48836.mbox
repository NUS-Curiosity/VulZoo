Subject: CVE-2022-48836: Input: aiptek - properly check endpoint type

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: aiptek - properly check endpoint type

Syzbot reported warning in usb_submit_urb() which is caused by wrong
endpoint type. There was a check for the number of endpoints, but not
for the type of endpoint.

Fix it by replacing old desc.bNumEndpoints check with
usb_find_common_endpoints() helper for finding endpoints

Fail log:

usb 5-1: BOGUS urb xfer, pipe 1 != type 3

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
