Subject: CVE-2022-48951: ASoC: ops: Check bounds for second channel in snd_soc_put_volsw_sx()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: ops: Check bounds for second channel in snd_soc_put_volsw_sx()

The bounds checks in snd_soc_put_volsw_sx() are only being applied to the
first channel, meaning it is possible to write out of bounds values to the
second channel in stereo controls. Add appropriate checks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48951 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
