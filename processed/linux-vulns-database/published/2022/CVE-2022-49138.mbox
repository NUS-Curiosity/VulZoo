Subject: CVE-2022-49138: Bluetooth: hci_event: Ignore multiple conn complete events

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_event: Ignore multiple conn complete events

When one of the three connection complete events is received multiple
times for the same handle, the device is registered multiple times which
leads to memory corruptions. Therefore, consequent events for a single
connection are ignored.

The conn->state can hold different values, therefore HCI_CONN_HANDLE_UNSET
is introduced to identify new connections. To make sure the events do not
contain this or another invalid handle HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX and checks
are introduced.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aa1ca580e3ffe62a2c5ea1c095b609b2943c5269
