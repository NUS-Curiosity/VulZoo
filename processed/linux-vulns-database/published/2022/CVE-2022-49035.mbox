Subject: CVE-2022-49035: media: s5p_cec: limit msg.len to CEC_MAX_MSG_SIZE

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: s5p_cec: limit msg.len to CEC_MAX_MSG_SIZE

I expect that the hardware will have limited this to 16, but just in
case it hasn't, check for this corner case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49035 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
