Subject: CVE-2022-48858: net/mlx5: Fix a race on command flush flow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix a race on command flush flow

Fix a refcount use after free warning due to a race on command entry.
Such race occurs when one of the commands releases its last refcount and
frees its index and entry while another process running command flush
flow takes refcount to this command entry. The process which handles
commands flush may see this command as needed to be flushed if the other
process released its refcount but didn't release the index yet. Fix it
by adding the needed spin lock.

It fixes the following warning trace:

refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 540311 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate+0x80/0xe0

RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0x80/0xe0

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
