Subject: CVE-2022-49389: usb: usbip: fix a refcount leak in stub_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: usbip: fix a refcount leak in stub_probe()

usb_get_dev() is called in stub_device_alloc(). When stub_probe() fails
after that, usb_put_dev() needs to be called to release the reference.

Fix this by moving usb_put_dev() to sdev_free error path handling.

Find this by code review.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49389 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
