                  BUG_ON(es->es_lblk + es->es_len < es->es_lblk)

The error ext4 extents is as follows:
0af3 0300 0400 0000 00000000    extent_header
00000000 0100 0000 12000000     extent1
00000000 0100 0000 18000000     extent2
02000000 0400 0000 14000000     extent3

In the ext4_valid_extent_entries function,
if prev is 0, no error is returned even if lblock<=prev.
This was intended to skip the check on the first extent, but
in the error image above, prev=0+1-1=0 when checking the second extent,
so even though lblock<=prev, the function does not return an error.
As a result, bug_ON occurs in __es_tree_search and the system panics.

To solve this problem, we only need to check that:
1. The lblock of the first extent is not less than 0.
2. The lblock of the next extent  is not less than
   the next block of the previous extent.
The same applies to extent_idx.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49409 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
