Subject: CVE-2022-48704: drm/radeon: add a force flush to delay work when radeon

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/radeon: add a force flush to delay work when radeon

Although radeon card fence and wait for gpu to finish processing current batch rings,
there is still a corner case that radeon lockup work queue may not be fully flushed,
and meanwhile the radeon_suspend_kms() function has called pci_set_power_state() to
put device in D3hot state.
Per PCI spec rev 4.0 on 5.3.1.4.1 D3hot State.
> Configuration and Message requests are the only TLPs accepted by a Function in
> the D3hot state. All other received Requests must be handled as Unsupported Requests,
> and all received Completions may optionally be handled as Unexpected Completions.
This issue will happen in following logs:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
