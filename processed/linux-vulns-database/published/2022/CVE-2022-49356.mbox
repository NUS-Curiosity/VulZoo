Subject: CVE-2022-49356: SUNRPC: Trap RDMA segment overflows

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

SUNRPC: Trap RDMA segment overflows

Prevent svc_rdma_build_writes() from walking off the end of a Write
chunk's segment array. Caught with KASAN.

The test that this fix replaces is invalid, and might have been left
over from an earlier prototype of the PCL work.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49356 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
