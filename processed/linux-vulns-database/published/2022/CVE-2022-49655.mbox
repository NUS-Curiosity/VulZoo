Subject: CVE-2022-49655: fscache: Fix invalidation/lookup race

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fscache: Fix invalidation/lookup race

If an NFS file is opened for writing and closed, fscache_invalidate() will
be asked to invalidate the file - however, if the cookie is in the
LOOKING_UP state (or the CREATING state), then request to invalidate
doesn't get recorded for fscache_cookie_state_machine() to do something
with.

Fix this by making __fscache_invalidate() set a flag if it sees the cookie
is in the LOOKING_UP state to indicate that we need to go to invalidation.
Note that this requires a count on the n_accesses counter for the state
machine, which that will release when it's done.

fscache_cookie_state_machine() then shifts to the INVALIDATING state if it
sees the flag.

Without this, an nfs file can get corrupted if it gets modified locally and
then read locally as the cache contents may not get updated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49655 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/fscache/cookie.c
	include/linux/fscache.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b1ae9f617f8a5c848d9205b8e228c6f0d1af754b
