Subject: CVE-2022-49636: vlan: fix memory leak in vlan_newlink()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vlan: fix memory leak in vlan_newlink()

Blamed commit added back a bug I fixed in commit 9bbd917e0bec
("vlan: fix memory leak in vlan_dev_set_egress_priority")

If a memory allocation fails in vlan_changelink() after other allocations
succeeded, we need to call vlan_dev_free_egress_priority()
to free all allocated memory because after a failed ->newlink()
we do not call any methods like ndo_uninit() or dev->priv_destructor().

In following example, if the allocation for last element 2000:2001 fails,
we need to free eight prior allocations:

ip link add link dummy0 dummy0.100 type vlan id 100 \
	egress-qos-map 1:2 2:3 3:4 4:5 5:6 6:7 7:8 8:9 2000:2001

syzbot report was:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4c43069bb1097dd6cc1cf0f7c43a36d1f7b3910b
