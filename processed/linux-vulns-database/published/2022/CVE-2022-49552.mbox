Subject: CVE-2022-49552: bpf: Fix combination of jit blinding and pointers to bpf subprogs.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix combination of jit blinding and pointers to bpf subprogs.

The combination of jit blinding and pointers to bpf subprogs causes:
[   36.989548] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000100000001
[   36.990342] #PF: supervisor instruction fetch in kernel mode
[   36.990968] #PF: error_code(0x0010) - not-present page
[   36.994859] RIP: 0010:0x100000001
[   36.995209] Code: Unable to access opcode bytes at RIP 0xffffffd7.
[   37.004091] Call Trace:
[   37.004351]  <TASK>
[   37.004576]  ? bpf_loop+0x4d/0x70
[   37.004932]  ? bpf_prog_3899083f75e4c5de_F+0xe3/0x13b

The jit blinding logic didn't recognize that ld_imm64 with an address
of bpf subprogram is a special instruction and proceeded to randomize it.
By itself it wouldn't have been an issue, but jit_subprogs() logic
relies on two step process to JIT all subprogs and then JIT them
again when addresses of all subprogs are known.
Blinding process in the first JIT phase caused second JIT to miss
adjustment of special ld_imm64.

Fix this issue by ignoring special ld_imm64 instructions that don't have
user controlled constants and shouldn't be blinded.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49552 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
