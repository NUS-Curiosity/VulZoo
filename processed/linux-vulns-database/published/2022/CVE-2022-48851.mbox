Subject: CVE-2022-48851: staging: gdm724x: fix use after free in gdm_lte_rx()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: gdm724x: fix use after free in gdm_lte_rx()

The netif_rx_ni() function frees the skb so we can't dereference it to
save the skb->len.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48851 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
