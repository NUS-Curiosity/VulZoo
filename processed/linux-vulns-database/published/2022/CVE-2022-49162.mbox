Subject: CVE-2022-49162: video: fbdev: sm712fb: Fix crash in smtcfb_write()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

video: fbdev: sm712fb: Fix crash in smtcfb_write()

When the sm712fb driver writes three bytes to the framebuffer, the
driver will crash:

    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc90001ffffff
    RIP: 0010:smtcfb_write+0x454/0x5b0
    Call Trace:
     vfs_write+0x291/0xd60
     ? do_sys_openat2+0x27d/0x350
     ? __fget_light+0x54/0x340
     ksys_write+0xce/0x190
     do_syscall_64+0x43/0x90
     entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae

Fix it by removing the open-coded endianness fixup-code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49162 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
