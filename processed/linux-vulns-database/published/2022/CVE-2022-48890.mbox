Subject: CVE-2022-48890: scsi: storvsc: Fix swiotlb bounce buffer leak in confidential VM

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: storvsc: Fix swiotlb bounce buffer leak in confidential VM

storvsc_queuecommand() maps the scatter/gather list using scsi_dma_map(),
which in a confidential VM allocates swiotlb bounce buffers. If the I/O
submission fails in storvsc_do_io(), the I/O is typically retried by higher
level code, but the bounce buffer memory is never freed.  The mostly like
cause of I/O submission failure is a full VMBus channel ring buffer, which
is not uncommon under high I/O loads.  Eventually enough bounce buffer
memory leaks that the confidential VM can't do any I/O. The same problem
can arise in a non-confidential VM with kernel boot parameter
swiotlb=force.

Fix this by doing scsi_dma_unmap() in the case of an I/O submission
error, which frees the bounce buffer memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48890 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/87c71e88f6a6619ffb1ff88f84dff48ef6d57adb
