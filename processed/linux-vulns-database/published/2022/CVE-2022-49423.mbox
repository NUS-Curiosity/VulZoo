Subject: CVE-2022-49423: rtla: Avoid record NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtla: Avoid record NULL pointer dereference

Fix the following null/deref_null.cocci errors:
./tools/tracing/rtla/src/osnoise_hist.c:870:31-36: ERROR: record is NULL but dereferenced.
./tools/tracing/rtla/src/osnoise_top.c:650:31-36: ERROR: record is NULL but dereferenced.
./tools/tracing/rtla/src/timerlat_hist.c:905:31-36: ERROR: record is NULL but dereferenced.
./tools/tracing/rtla/src/timerlat_top.c:700:31-36: ERROR: record is NULL but dereferenced.

"record" is NULL before calling osnoise_init_trace_tool.
Add a tag "out_free" to avoid dereferring a NULL pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49423 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
