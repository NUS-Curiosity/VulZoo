Subject: CVE-2022-49515: ASoC: cs35l41: Fix an out-of-bounds access in otp_packed_element_t

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: cs35l41: Fix an out-of-bounds access in otp_packed_element_t

The CS35L41_NUM_OTP_ELEM is 100, but only 99 entries are defined in
the array otp_map_1/2[CS35L41_NUM_OTP_ELEM], this will trigger UBSAN
to report a shift-out-of-bounds warning in the cs35l41_otp_unpack()
since the last entry in the array will result in GENMASK(-1, 0).

UBSAN reports this problem:
 UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in /home/hwang4/build/jammy/jammy/sound/soc/codecs/cs35l41-lib.c:836:8
 shift exponent 64 is too large for 64-bit type 'long unsigned int'
 CPU: 10 PID: 595 Comm: systemd-udevd Not tainted 5.15.0-23-generic #23
 Hardware name: LENOVO \x02MFG_IN_GO/\x02MFG_IN_GO, BIOS N3GET19W (1.00 ) 03/11/2022

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
