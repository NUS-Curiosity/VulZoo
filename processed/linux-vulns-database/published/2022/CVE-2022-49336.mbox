Subject: CVE-2022-49336: drm/etnaviv: check for reaped mapping in etnaviv_iommu_unmap_gem

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/etnaviv: check for reaped mapping in etnaviv_iommu_unmap_gem

When the mapping is already reaped the unmap must be a no-op, as we
would otherwise try to remove the mapping twice, corrupting the involved
data structures.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49336 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
