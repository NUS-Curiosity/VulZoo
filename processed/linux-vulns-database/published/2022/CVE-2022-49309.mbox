Subject: CVE-2022-49309: drivers: staging: rtl8723bs: Fix deadlock in rtw_surveydone_event_callback()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers: staging: rtl8723bs: Fix deadlock in rtw_surveydone_event_callback()

There is a deadlock in rtw_surveydone_event_callback(),
which is shown below:

   (Thread 1)                  |      (Thread 2)
                               | _set_timer()
rtw_surveydone_event_callback()|  mod_timer()
 spin_lock_bh() //(1)          |  (wait a time)
 ...                           | rtw_scan_timeout_handler()
 del_timer_sync()              |  spin_lock_bh() //(2)
 (wait timer to stop)          |  ...

We hold pmlmepriv->lock in position (1) of thread 1 and use
del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler
also need pmlmepriv->lock in position (2) of thread 2.
As a result, rtw_surveydone_event_callback() will block forever.

This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of
spin_lock_bh(), which could let timer handler to obtain
the needed lock. What`s more, we change spin_lock_bh() in
rtw_scan_timeout_handler() to spin_lock_irq(). Otherwise,
spin_lock_bh() will also cause deadlock() in timer handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49309 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
