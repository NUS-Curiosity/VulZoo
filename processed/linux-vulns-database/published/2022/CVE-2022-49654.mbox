Subject: CVE-2022-49654: net: dsa: qca8k: reset cpu port on MTU change

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: qca8k: reset cpu port on MTU change

It was discovered that the Documentation lacks of a fundamental detail
on how to correctly change the MAX_FRAME_SIZE of the switch.

In fact if the MAX_FRAME_SIZE is changed while the cpu port is on, the
switch panics and cease to send any packet. This cause the mgmt ethernet
system to not receive any packet (the slow fallback still works) and
makes the device not reachable. To recover from this a switch reset is
required.

To correctly handle this, turn off the cpu ports before changing the
MAX_FRAME_SIZE and turn on again after the value is applied.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49654 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/188c798f3c2554fa0d7147e9b97baf144b817019
