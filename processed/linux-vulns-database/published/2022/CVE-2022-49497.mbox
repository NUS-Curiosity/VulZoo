Subject: CVE-2022-49497: net: remove two BUG() from skb_checksum_help()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: remove two BUG() from skb_checksum_help()

I have a syzbot report that managed to get a crash in skb_checksum_help()

If syzbot can trigger these BUG(), it makes sense to replace
them with more friendly WARN_ON_ONCE() since skb_checksum_help()
can instead return an error code.

Note that syzbot will still crash there, until real bug is fixed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49497 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
