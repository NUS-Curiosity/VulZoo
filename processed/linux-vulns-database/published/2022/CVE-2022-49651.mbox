Subject: CVE-2022-49651: srcu: Tighten cleanup_srcu_struct() GP checks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

srcu: Tighten cleanup_srcu_struct() GP checks

Currently, cleanup_srcu_struct() checks for a grace period in progress,
but it does not check for a grace period that has not yet started but
which might start at any time.  Such a situation could result in a
use-after-free bug, so this commit adds a check for a grace period that
is needed but not yet started to cleanup_srcu_struct().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49651 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.18.11 with commit e997dda6502eefbc1032d6b0da7b353c53344b07
	Fixed in 5.19 with commit 8ed00760203d8018bee042fbfe8e076579be2c2b

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e997dda6502eefbc1032d6b0da7b353c53344b07
