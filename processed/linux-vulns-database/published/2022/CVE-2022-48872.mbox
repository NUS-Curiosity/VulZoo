Subject: CVE-2022-48872: misc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free race condition for maps

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free race condition for maps

It is possible that in between calling fastrpc_map_get() until
map->fl->lock is taken in fastrpc_free_map(), another thread can call
fastrpc_map_lookup() and get a reference to a map that is about to be
deleted.

Rewrite fastrpc_map_get() to only increase the reference count of a map
if it's non-zero. Propagate this to callers so they can know if a map is
about to be deleted.

Fixes this warning:
refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 10100 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate
...

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
