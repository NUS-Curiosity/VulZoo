Subject: CVE-2022-49725: i40e: Fix call trace in setup_tx_descriptors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: Fix call trace in setup_tx_descriptors

After PF reset and ethtool -t there was call trace in dmesg
sometimes leading to panic. When there was some time, around 5
seconds, between reset and test there were no errors.

Problem was that pf reset calls i40e_vsi_close in prep_for_reset
and ethtool -t calls i40e_vsi_close in diag_test. If there was not
enough time between those commands the second i40e_vsi_close starts
before previous i40e_vsi_close was done which leads to crash.

Add check to diag_test if pf is in reset and don't start offline
tests if it is true.
Add netif_info("testing failed") into unhappy path of i40e_diag_test()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49725 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
