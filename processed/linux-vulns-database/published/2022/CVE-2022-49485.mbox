Subject: CVE-2022-49485: drm/v3d: Fix null pointer dereference of pointer perfmon

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Fix null pointer dereference of pointer perfmon

In the unlikely event that pointer perfmon is null the WARN_ON return path
occurs after the pointer has already been deferenced. Fix this by only
dereferencing perfmon after it has been null checked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49485 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
