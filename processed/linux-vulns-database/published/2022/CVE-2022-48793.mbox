Subject: CVE-2022-48793: KVM: x86: nSVM: fix potential NULL derefernce on nested migration

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: nSVM: fix potential NULL derefernce on nested migration

Turns out that due to review feedback and/or rebases
I accidentally moved the call to nested_svm_load_cr3 to be too early,
before the NPT is enabled, which is very wrong to do.

KVM can't even access guest memory at that point as nested NPT
is needed for that, and of course it won't initialize the walk_mmu,
which is main issue the patch was addressing.

Fix this for real.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48793 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
