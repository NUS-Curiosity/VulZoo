Subject: CVE-2022-49147: block: Fix the maximum minor value is blk_alloc_ext_minor()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Fix the maximum minor value is blk_alloc_ext_minor()

ida_alloc_range(..., min, max, ...) returns values from min to max,
inclusive.

So, NR_EXT_DEVT is a valid idx returned by blk_alloc_ext_minor().

This is an issue because in device_add_disk(), this value is used in:
   ddev->devt = MKDEV(disk->major, disk->first_minor);
and NR_EXT_DEVT is '(1 << MINORBITS)'.

So, should 'disk->first_minor' be NR_EXT_DEVT, it would overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49147 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
