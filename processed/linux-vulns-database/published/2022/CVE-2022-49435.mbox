Subject: CVE-2022-49435: mfd: davinci_voicecodec: Fix possible null-ptr-deref davinci_vc_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mfd: davinci_voicecodec: Fix possible null-ptr-deref davinci_vc_probe()

It will cause null-ptr-deref when using 'res', if platform_get_resource()
returns NULL, so move using 'res' after devm_ioremap_resource() that
will check it to avoid null-ptr-deref.
And use devm_platform_get_and_ioremap_resource() to simplify code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49435 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
