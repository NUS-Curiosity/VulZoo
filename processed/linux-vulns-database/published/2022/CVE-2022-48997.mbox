Subject: CVE-2022-48997: char: tpm: Protect tpm_pm_suspend with locks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

char: tpm: Protect tpm_pm_suspend with locks

Currently tpm transactions are executed unconditionally in
tpm_pm_suspend() function, which may lead to races with other tpm
accessors in the system.

Specifically, the hw_random tpm driver makes use of tpm_get_random(),
and this function is called in a loop from a kthread, which means it's
not frozen alongside userspace, and so can race with the work done
during system suspend:

  tpm tpm0: tpm_transmit: tpm_recv: error -52
  tpm tpm0: invalid TPM_STS.x 0xff, dumping stack for forensics
  CPU: 0 PID: 1 Comm: init Not tainted 6.1.0-rc5+ #135
  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (Q35 + ICH9, 2009), BIOS 1.16.0-20220807_005459-localhost 04/01/2014
  Call Trace:
   tpm_tis_status.cold+0x19/0x20
   tpm_transmit+0x13b/0x390
   tpm_transmit_cmd+0x20/0x80
   tpm1_pm_suspend+0xa6/0x110
   tpm_pm_suspend+0x53/0x80
   __pnp_bus_suspend+0x35/0xe0
   __device_suspend+0x10f/0x350

Fix this by calling tpm_try_get_ops(), which itself is a wrapper around
tpm_chip_start(), but takes the appropriate mutex.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
