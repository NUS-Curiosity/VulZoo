Subject: CVE-2022-48841: ice: fix NULL pointer dereference in ice_update_vsi_tx_ring_stats()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix NULL pointer dereference in ice_update_vsi_tx_ring_stats()

It is possible to do NULL pointer dereference in routine that updates
Tx ring stats. Currently only stats and bytes are updated when ring
pointer is valid, but later on ring is accessed to propagate gathered Tx
stats onto VSI stats.

Change the existing logic to move to next ring when ring is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48841 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
