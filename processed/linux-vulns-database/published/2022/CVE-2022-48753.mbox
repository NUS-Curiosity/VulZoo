Subject: CVE-2022-48753: block: fix memory leak in disk_register_independent_access_ranges

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix memory leak in disk_register_independent_access_ranges

kobject_init_and_add() takes reference even when it fails.
According to the doc of kobject_init_and_add()

   If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to
   properly clean up the memory associated with the object.

Fix this issue by adding kobject_put().
Callback function blk_ia_ranges_sysfs_release() in kobject_put()
can handle the pointer "iars" properly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48753 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
