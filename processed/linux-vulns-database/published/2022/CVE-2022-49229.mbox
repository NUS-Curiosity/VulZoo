Subject: CVE-2022-49229: ptp: unregister virtual clocks when unregistering physical clock.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ptp: unregister virtual clocks when unregistering physical clock.

When unregistering a physical clock which has some virtual clocks,
unregister the virtual clocks with it.

This fixes the following oops, which can be triggered by unloading
a driver providing a PTP clock when it has enabled virtual clocks:

BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffc04fc4d8

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
