Subject: CVE-2022-49195: net: dsa: fix panic on shutdown if multi-chip tree failed to probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: fix panic on shutdown if multi-chip tree failed to probe

DSA probing is atypical because a tree of devices must probe all at
once, so out of N switches which call dsa_tree_setup_routing_table()
during probe, for (N - 1) of them, "complete" will return false and they
will exit probing early. The Nth switch will set up the whole tree on
their behalf.

The implication is that for (N - 1) switches, the driver binds to the
device successfully, without doing anything. When the driver is bound,
the ->shutdown() method may run. But if the Nth switch has failed to
initialize the tree, there is nothing to do for the (N - 1) driver
instances, since the slave devices have not been created, etc. Moreover,
dsa_switch_shutdown() expects that the calling @ds has been in fact
initialized, so it jumps at dereferencing the various data structures,
which is incorrect.

Avoid the ensuing NULL pointer dereferences by simply checking whether
the Nth switch has previously set "ds->setup = true" for the switch
which is currently shutting down. The entire setup is serialized under
dsa2_mutex which we already hold.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49195 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
