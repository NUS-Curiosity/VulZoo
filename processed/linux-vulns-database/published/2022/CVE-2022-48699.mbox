Subject: CVE-2022-48699: sched/debug: fix dentry leak in update_sched_domain_debugfs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/debug: fix dentry leak in update_sched_domain_debugfs

Kuyo reports that the pattern of using debugfs_remove(debugfs_lookup())
leaks a dentry and with a hotplug stress test, the machine eventually
runs out of memory.

Fix this up by using the newly created debugfs_lookup_and_remove() call
instead which properly handles the dentry reference counting logic.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48699 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.15.68 with commit 26e9a1ded892
	Fixed in 5.19.9 with commit 0c32a93963e0
	Fixed in 6.0 with commit c2e406596571

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
