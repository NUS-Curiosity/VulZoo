Subject: CVE-2022-49353: powerpc/papr_scm: don't requests stats with '0' sized stats buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/papr_scm: don't requests stats with '0' sized stats buffer

Sachin reported [1] that on a POWER-10 lpar he is seeing a kernel panic being
reported with vPMEM when papr_scm probe is being called. The panic is of the
form below and is observed only with following option disabled(profile) for the
said LPAR 'Enable Performance Information Collection' in the HMC:

 Kernel attempted to write user page (1c) - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)
 BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference on write at 0x0000001c

 Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception

On investigation looks like this panic was caused due to a 'stat_buffer' of
size==0 being provided to drc_pmem_query_stats() to fetch all performance
stats-ids of an NVDIMM. However drc_pmem_query_stats() shouldn't have been called
since the vPMEM NVDIMM doesn't support and performance stat-id's. This was caused
due to missing check for 'p->stat_buffer_len' at the beginning of
papr_scm_pmu_check_events() which indicates that the NVDIMM doesn't support
performance-stats.

Fix this by introducing the check for 'p->stat_buffer_len' at the beginning of
papr_scm_pmu_check_events().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1295aab2ebcda1c1a9ed342baedc080e5c393e5
