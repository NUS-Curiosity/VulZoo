Subject: CVE-2022-49234: net: dsa: Avoid cross-chip syncing of VLAN filtering

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: Avoid cross-chip syncing of VLAN filtering

Changes to VLAN filtering are not applicable to cross-chip
notifications.

On a system like this:

.-----.   .-----.   .-----.
| sw1 +---+ sw2 +---+ sw3 |
'-1-2-'   '-1-2-'   '-1-2-'

Before this change, upon sw1p1 leaving a bridge, a call to
dsa_port_vlan_filtering would also be made to sw2p1 and sw3p1.

In this scenario:

.---------.   .-----.   .-----.
|   sw1   +---+ sw2 +---+ sw3 |
'-1-2-3-4-'   '-1-2-'   '-1-2-'

When sw1p4 would leave a bridge, dsa_port_vlan_filtering would be
called for sw2 and sw3 with a non-existing port - leading to array
out-of-bounds accesses and crashes on mv88e6xxx.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49234 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
