Subject: CVE-2022-49589: igmp: Fix data-races around sysctl_igmp_qrv.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igmp: Fix data-races around sysctl_igmp_qrv.

While reading sysctl_igmp_qrv, it can be changed concurrently.
Thus, we need to add READ_ONCE() to its readers.

This test can be packed into a helper, so such changes will be in the
follow-up series after net is merged into net-next.

  qrv ?: READ_ONCE(net->ipv4.sysctl_igmp_qrv);

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49589 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
