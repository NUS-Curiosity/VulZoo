Subject: CVE-2022-49083: iommu/omap: Fix regression in probe for NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/omap: Fix regression in probe for NULL pointer dereference

Commit 3f6634d997db ("iommu: Use right way to retrieve iommu_ops") started
triggering a NULL pointer dereference for some omap variants:

__iommu_probe_device from probe_iommu_group+0x2c/0x38
probe_iommu_group from bus_for_each_dev+0x74/0xbc
bus_for_each_dev from bus_iommu_probe+0x34/0x2e8
bus_iommu_probe from bus_set_iommu+0x80/0xc8
bus_set_iommu from omap_iommu_init+0x88/0xcc
omap_iommu_init from do_one_initcall+0x44/0x24

This is caused by omap iommu probe returning 0 instead of ERR_PTR(-ENODEV)
as noted by Jason Gunthorpe <jgg@ziepe.ca>.

Looks like the regression already happened with an earlier commit
6785eb9105e3 ("iommu/omap: Convert to probe/release_device() call-backs")
that changed the function return type and missed converting one place.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49083 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
