Subject: CVE-2022-49032: iio: health: afe4404: Fix oob read in afe4404_[read|write]_raw

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: health: afe4404: Fix oob read in afe4404_[read|write]_raw

KASAN report out-of-bounds read as follows:

BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in afe4404_read_raw+0x2ce/0x380
Read of size 4 at addr ffffffffc00e4658 by task cat/278

Call Trace:
 afe4404_read_raw
 iio_read_channel_info
 dev_attr_show

The buggy address belongs to the variable:
 afe4404_channel_leds+0x18/0xffffffffffffe9c0

This issue can be reproduce by singe command:

 $ cat /sys/bus/i2c/devices/0-0058/iio\:device0/in_intensity6_raw

The array size of afe4404_channel_leds and afe4404_channel_offdacs
are less than channels, so access with chan->address cause OOB read
in afe4404_[read|write]_raw. Fix it by moving access before use them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49032 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
