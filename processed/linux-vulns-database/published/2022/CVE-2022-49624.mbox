Subject: CVE-2022-49624: net: atlantic: remove aq_nic_deinit() when resume

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: atlantic: remove aq_nic_deinit() when resume

aq_nic_deinit() has been called while suspending, so we don't have to call
it again on resume.
Actually, call it again leads to another hang issue when resuming from
S3.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
