Subject: CVE-2022-48694: RDMA/irdma: Fix drain SQ hang with no completion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/irdma: Fix drain SQ hang with no completion

SW generated completions for outstanding WRs posted on SQ
after QP is in error target the wrong CQ. This causes the
ib_drain_sq to hang with no completion.

Fix this to generate completions on the right CQ.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/14d148401c5202fec3a071e24785481d540b22c3
