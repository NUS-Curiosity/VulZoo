Subject: CVE-2022-49408: ext4: fix memory leak in parse_apply_sb_mount_options()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix memory leak in parse_apply_sb_mount_options()

If processing the on-disk mount options fails after any memory was
allocated in the ext4_fs_context, e.g. s_qf_names, then this memory is
leaked.  Fix this by calling ext4_fc_free() instead of kfree() directly.

Reproducer:

    mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/vdc
    tune2fs /dev/vdc -E mount_opts=usrjquota=file
    echo clear > /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
    mount /dev/vdc /vdc
    echo scan > /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
    sleep 5
    echo scan > /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
    cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49408 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
