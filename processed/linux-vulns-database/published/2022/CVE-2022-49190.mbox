Subject: CVE-2022-49190: kernel/resource: fix kfree() of bootmem memory again

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kernel/resource: fix kfree() of bootmem memory again

Since commit ebff7d8f270d ("mem hotunplug: fix kfree() of bootmem
memory"), we could get a resource allocated during boot via
alloc_resource().  And it's required to release the resource using
free_resource().  Howerver, many people use kfree directly which will
result in kernel BUG.  In order to fix this without fixing every call
site, just leak a couple of bytes in such corner case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49190 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
