Subject: CVE-2022-49380: f2fs: fix to avoid f2fs_bug_on() in dec_valid_node_count()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid f2fs_bug_on() in dec_valid_node_count()

As Yanming reported in bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215897

I have encountered a bug in F2FS file system in kernel v5.17.

The kernel should enable CONFIG_KASAN=y and CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE=y. You can
reproduce the bug by running the following commands:

The kernel message is shown below:

kernel BUG at fs/f2fs/f2fs.h:2511!
Call Trace:
 f2fs_remove_inode_page+0x2a2/0x830
 f2fs_evict_inode+0x9b7/0x1510
 evict+0x282/0x4e0
 do_unlinkat+0x33a/0x540
 __x64_sys_unlinkat+0x8e/0xd0
 do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90
 entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xae

The root cause is: .total_valid_block_count or .total_valid_node_count
could fuzzed to zero, then once dec_valid_node_count() was called, it
will cause BUG_ON(), this patch fixes to print warning info and set
SBI_NEED_FSCK into CP instead of panic.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49380 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
