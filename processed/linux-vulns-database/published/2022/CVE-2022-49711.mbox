Subject: CVE-2022-49711: bus: fsl-mc-bus: fix KASAN use-after-free in fsl_mc_bus_remove()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bus: fsl-mc-bus: fix KASAN use-after-free in fsl_mc_bus_remove()

In fsl_mc_bus_remove(), mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io is passed to
fsl_destroy_mc_io(). However, mc->root_mc_bus_dev is already freed in
fsl_mc_device_remove(). Then reference to mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io
triggers KASAN use-after-free. To avoid the use-after-free, keep the
reference to mc->root_mc_bus_dev->mc_io in a local variable and pass to
fsl_destroy_mc_io().

This patch needs rework to apply to kernels older than v5.15.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49711 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
