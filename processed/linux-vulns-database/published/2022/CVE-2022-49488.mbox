Subject: CVE-2022-49488: drm/msm/mdp5: Return error code in mdp5_mixer_release when deadlock is detected

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/mdp5: Return error code in mdp5_mixer_release when deadlock is detected

There is a possibility for mdp5_get_global_state to return
-EDEADLK when acquiring the modeset lock, but currently global_state in
mdp5_mixer_release doesn't check for if an error is returned.

To avoid a NULL dereference error, let's have mdp5_mixer_release
check if an error is returned and propagate that error.

Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/485181/

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49488 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
