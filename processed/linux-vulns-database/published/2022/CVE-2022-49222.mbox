Subject: CVE-2022-49222: drm/bridge: anx7625: Fix overflow issue on reading EDID

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/bridge: anx7625: Fix overflow issue on reading EDID

The length of EDID block can be longer than 256 bytes, so we should use
`int` instead of `u8` for the `edid_pos` variable.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49222 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
