Subject: CVE-2022-48934: nfp: flower: Fix a potential leak in nfp_tunnel_add_shared_mac()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfp: flower: Fix a potential leak in nfp_tunnel_add_shared_mac()

ida_simple_get() returns an id between min (0) and max (NFP_MAX_MAC_INDEX)
inclusive.
So NFP_MAX_MAC_INDEX (0xff) is a valid id.

In order for the error handling path to work correctly, the 'invalid'
value for 'ida_idx' should not be in the 0..NFP_MAX_MAC_INDEX range,
inclusive.

So set it to -1.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48934 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
