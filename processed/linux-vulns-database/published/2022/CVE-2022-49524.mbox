Subject: CVE-2022-49524: media: pci: cx23885: Fix the error handling in cx23885_initdev()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: pci: cx23885: Fix the error handling in cx23885_initdev()

When the driver fails to call the dma_set_mask(), the driver will get
the following splat:

[   55.853884] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __process_removed_driver+0x3c/0x240
[   55.854486] Read of size 8 at addr ffff88810de60408 by task modprobe/590
[   55.856822] Call Trace:
[   55.860327]  __process_removed_driver+0x3c/0x240
[   55.861347]  bus_for_each_dev+0x102/0x160
[   55.861681]  i2c_del_driver+0x2f/0x50

This is because the driver has initialized the i2c related resources
in cx23885_dev_setup() but not released them in error handling, fix this
bug by modifying the error path that jumps after failing to call the
dma_set_mask().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49524 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
