Subject: CVE-2022-49392: serial: 8250_aspeed_vuart: Fix potential NULL dereference in aspeed_vuart_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: 8250_aspeed_vuart: Fix potential NULL dereference in aspeed_vuart_probe

platform_get_resource() may fail and return NULL, so we should
better check it's return value to avoid a NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49392 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
