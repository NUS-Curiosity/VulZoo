Subject: CVE-2022-49218: drm/dp: Fix OOB read when handling Post Cursor2 register

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/dp: Fix OOB read when handling Post Cursor2 register

The link_status array was not large enough to read the Adjust Request
Post Cursor2 register, so remove the common helper function to avoid
an OOB read, found with a -Warray-bounds build:

drivers/gpu/drm/drm_dp_helper.c: In function 'drm_dp_get_adjust_request_post_cursor':
drivers/gpu/drm/drm_dp_helper.c:59:27: error: array subscript 10 is outside array bounds of 'const u8[6]' {aka 'const unsigned char[6]'} [-Werror=array-bounds]
   59 |         return link_status[r - DP_LANE0_1_STATUS];
      |                ~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/gpu/drm/drm_dp_helper.c:147:51: note: while referencing 'link_status'
  147 | u8 drm_dp_get_adjust_request_post_cursor(const u8 link_status[DP_LINK_STATUS_SIZE],
      |                                          ~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Replace the only user of the helper with an open-coded fetch and decode,
similar to drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/core/dc_link_dp.c.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49218 to this issue.

	drivers/gpu/drm/dp/drm_dp.c
	drivers/gpu/drm/tegra/dp.c
	include/drm/dp/drm_dp_helper.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aeaed9a9fe694f8b1462fb81e2d33298c929180b
