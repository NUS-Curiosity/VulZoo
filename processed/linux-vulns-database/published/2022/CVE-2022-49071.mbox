Subject: CVE-2022-49071: drm/panel: ili9341: fix optional regulator handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panel: ili9341: fix optional regulator handling

If the optional regulator lookup fails, reset the pointer to NULL.
Other functions such as mipi_dbi_poweron_reset_conditional() only do
a NULL pointer check and will otherwise dereference the error pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49071 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
