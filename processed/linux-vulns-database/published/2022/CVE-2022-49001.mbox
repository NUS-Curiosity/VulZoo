Subject: CVE-2022-49001: riscv: fix race when vmap stack overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: fix race when vmap stack overflow

Currently, when detecting vmap stack overflow, riscv firstly switches
to the so called shadow stack, then use this shadow stack to call the
get_overflow_stack() to get the overflow stack. However, there's
a race here if two or more harts use the same shadow stack at the same
time.

To solve this race, we introduce spin_shadow_stack atomic var, which
will be swap between its own address and 0 in atomic way, when the
var is set, it means the shadow_stack is being used; when the var
is cleared, it means the shadow_stack isn't being used.

[Palmer: Add AQ to the swap, and also some comments.]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49001 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
