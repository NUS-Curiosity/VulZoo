Subject: CVE-2022-49008: can: can327: can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(): fix potential skb leak when netdev is down

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: can327: can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(): fix potential skb leak when netdev is down

In can327_feed_frame_to_netdev(), it did not free the skb when netdev
is down, and all callers of can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() did not free
allocated skb too. That would trigger skb leak.

Fix it by adding kfree_skb() in can327_feed_frame_to_netdev() when netdev
is down. Not tested, just compiled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49008 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
