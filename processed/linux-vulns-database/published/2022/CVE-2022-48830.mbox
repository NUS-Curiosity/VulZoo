Subject: CVE-2022-48830: can: isotp: fix potential CAN frame reception race in isotp_rcv()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: isotp: fix potential CAN frame reception race in isotp_rcv()

When receiving a CAN frame the current code logic does not consider
concurrently receiving processes which do not show up in real world
usage.

The following syz problem is one of the scenarios. so->rx.len is
changed by isotp_rcv_ff() during isotp_rcv_cf(), so->rx.len equals
0 before alloc_skb() and equals 4096 after alloc_skb(). That will
trigger skb_over_panic() in skb_put().

Therefore we make sure the state changes and data structures stay
consistent at CAN frame reception time by adding a spin_lock in
isotp_rcv(). This fixes the issue reported by syzkaller but does not
affect real world operation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48830 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
