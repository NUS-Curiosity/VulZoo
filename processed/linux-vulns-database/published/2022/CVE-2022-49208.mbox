Subject: CVE-2022-49208: RDMA/irdma: Prevent some integer underflows

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/irdma: Prevent some integer underflows

My static checker complains that:

    drivers/infiniband/hw/irdma/ctrl.c:3605 irdma_sc_ceq_init()
    warn: can subtract underflow 'info->dev->hmc_fpm_misc.max_ceqs'?

It appears that "info->dev->hmc_fpm_misc.max_ceqs" comes from the firmware
in irdma_sc_parse_fpm_query_buf() so, yes, there is a chance that it could
be zero.  Even if we trust the firmware, it's easy enough to change the
condition just as a hardenning measure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49208 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
