Subject: CVE-2022-48635: fsdax: Fix infinite loop in dax_iomap_rw()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsdax: Fix infinite loop in dax_iomap_rw()

I got an infinite loop and a WARNING report when executing a tail command
in virtiofs.

  WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 964 at fs/iomap/iter.c:34 iomap_iter+0x3a2/0x3d0
  Modules linked in:
  CPU: 10 PID: 964 Comm: tail Not tainted 5.19.0-rc7
  Call Trace:
  <TASK>

  ? __this_cpu_preempt_check+0x13/0x20

The tail command will call read() with a count of 0. In this case,
iomap_iter() will report this WARNING, and always return 1 which casuing
the infinite loop in dax_iomap_rw().

Fixing by checking count whether is 0 in dax_iomap_rw().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48635 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
