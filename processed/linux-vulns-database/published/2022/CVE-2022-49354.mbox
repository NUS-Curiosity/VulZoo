Subject: CVE-2022-49354: ata: pata_octeon_cf: Fix refcount leak in octeon_cf_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ata: pata_octeon_cf: Fix refcount leak in octeon_cf_probe

of_find_device_by_node() takes reference, we should use put_device()
to release it when not need anymore.
Add missing put_device() to avoid refcount leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49354 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
