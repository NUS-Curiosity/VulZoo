Subject: CVE-2022-49385: driver: base: fix UAF when driver_attach failed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

driver: base: fix UAF when driver_attach failed

When driver_attach(drv); failed, the driver_private will be freed.
But it has been added to the bus, which caused a UAF.

To fix it, we need to delete it from the bus when failed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49385 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
