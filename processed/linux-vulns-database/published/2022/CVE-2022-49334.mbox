Subject: CVE-2022-49334: mm/huge_memory: Fix xarray node memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/huge_memory: Fix xarray node memory leak

If xas_split_alloc() fails to allocate the necessary nodes to complete the
xarray entry split, it sets the xa_state to -ENOMEM, which xas_nomem()
then interprets as "Please allocate more memory", not as "Please free
any unnecessary memory" (which was the intended outcome).  It's confusing
to use xas_nomem() to free memory in this context, so call xas_destroy()
instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49334 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
