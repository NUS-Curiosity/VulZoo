Subject: CVE-2022-49166: ntfs: add sanity check on allocation size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntfs: add sanity check on allocation size

ntfs_read_inode_mount invokes ntfs_malloc_nofs with zero allocation
size.  It triggers one BUG in the __ntfs_malloc function.

Fix this by adding sanity check on ni->attr_list_size.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49166 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
