Subject: CVE-2022-48852: drm/vc4: hdmi: Unregister codec device on unbind

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vc4: hdmi: Unregister codec device on unbind

On bind we will register the HDMI codec device but we don't unregister
it on unbind, leading to a device leakage. Unregister our device at
unbind.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48852 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.15.29 with commit ee22082c3e2f

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
