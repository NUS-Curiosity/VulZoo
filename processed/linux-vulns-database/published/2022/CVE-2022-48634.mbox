Subject: CVE-2022-48634: drm/gma500: Fix BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context errors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/gma500: Fix BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context errors

gma_crtc_page_flip() was holding the event_lock spinlock while calling
crtc_funcs->mode_set_base() which takes ww_mutex.

The only reason to hold event_lock is to clear gma_crtc->page_flip_event
on mode_set_base() errors.

Instead unlock it after setting gma_crtc->page_flip_event and on
errors re-take the lock and clear gma_crtc->page_flip_event it
it is still set.

This fixes the following WARN/stacktrace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
