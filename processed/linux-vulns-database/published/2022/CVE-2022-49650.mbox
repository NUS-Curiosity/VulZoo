Subject: CVE-2022-49650: dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: fix runtime PM underflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: fix runtime PM underflow

Commit dbad41e7bb5f ("dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: check if the runtime pm enabled")
caused unbalanced pm_runtime_get/put() calls when the bam is
controlled remotely. This commit reverts it and just enables pm_runtime
in all cases, the clk_* functions already just nop when the clock is NULL.

Also clean up a bit by removing unnecessary bamclk null checks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49650 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
