Subject: CVE-2022-49625: sfc: fix kernel panic when creating VF

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sfc: fix kernel panic when creating VF

When creating VFs a kernel panic can happen when calling to
efx_ef10_try_update_nic_stats_vf.

When releasing a DMA coherent buffer, sometimes, I don't know in what
specific circumstances, it has to unmap memory with vunmap. It is
disallowed to do that in IRQ context or with BH disabled. Otherwise, we
hit this line in vunmap, causing the crash:
  BUG_ON(in_interrupt());

This patch reenables BH to release the buffer.

Log messages when the bug is hit:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
