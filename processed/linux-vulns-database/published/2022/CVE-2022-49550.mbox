Subject: CVE-2022-49550: fs/ntfs3: provide block_invalidate_folio to fix memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: provide block_invalidate_folio to fix memory leak

The ntfs3 filesystem lacks the 'invalidate_folio' method and it causes
memory leak. If you write to the filesystem and then unmount it, the
cached written data are not freed and they are permanently leaked.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49550 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
