Subject: CVE-2022-49129: mt76: mt7921: fix crash when startup fails.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mt76: mt7921: fix crash when startup fails.

If the nic fails to start, it is possible that the
reset_work has already been scheduled.  Ensure the
work item is canceled so we do not have use-after-free
crash in case cleanup is called before the work item
is executed.

This fixes crash on my x86_64 apu2 when mt7921k radio
fails to work.  Radio still fails, but OS does not
crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49129 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
