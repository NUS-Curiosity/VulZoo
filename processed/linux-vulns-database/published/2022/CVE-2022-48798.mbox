Subject: CVE-2022-48798: s390/cio: verify the driver availability for path_event call

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/cio: verify the driver availability for path_event call

If no driver is attached to a device or the driver does not provide the
path_event function, an FCES path-event on this device could end up in a
kernel-panic. Verify the driver availability before the path_event
function call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48798 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
