Subject: CVE-2022-48755: powerpc64/bpf: Limit 'ldbrx' to processors compliant with ISA v2.06

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc64/bpf: Limit 'ldbrx' to processors compliant with ISA v2.06

Johan reported the below crash with test_bpf on ppc64 e5500:

  Illegal instruction

The illegal instruction turned out to be 'ldbrx' emitted for
BPF_FROM_[L|B]E, which was only introduced in ISA v2.06. Guard use of
the same and implement an alternative approach for older processors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48755 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
