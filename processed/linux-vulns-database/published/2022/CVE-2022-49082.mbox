Subject: CVE-2022-49082: scsi: mpt3sas: Fix use after free in _scsih_expander_node_remove()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpt3sas: Fix use after free in _scsih_expander_node_remove()

The function mpt3sas_transport_port_remove() called in
_scsih_expander_node_remove() frees the port field of the sas_expander
structure, leading to the following use-after-free splat from KASAN when
the ioc_info() call following that function is executed (e.g. when doing
rmmod of the driver module):

[ 3479.943087] ==================================================================

Fix this by introducing the local variable port_id to store the port ID
value before executing mpt3sas_transport_port_remove(). This local variable
is then used in the call to ioc_info() instead of dereferencing the freed
port structure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49082 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
