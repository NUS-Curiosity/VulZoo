Subject: CVE-2022-49245: ASoC: rockchip: Fix PM usage reference of rockchip_i2s_tdm_resume

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: rockchip: Fix PM usage reference of rockchip_i2s_tdm_resume

pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter
even it failed. Forgetting to putting operation will
result in reference leak here. We fix it by replacing
it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage counter
balanced.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49245 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
