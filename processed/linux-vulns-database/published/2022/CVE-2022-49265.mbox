Subject: CVE-2022-49265: PM: domains: Fix sleep-in-atomic bug caused by genpd_debug_remove()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PM: domains: Fix sleep-in-atomic bug caused by genpd_debug_remove()

When a genpd with GENPD_FLAG_IRQ_SAFE gets removed, the following
sleep-in-atomic bug will be seen, as genpd_debug_remove() will be called
with a spinlock being held.

It doesn't seem necessary to call genpd_debug_remove() with the lock, so
move it out from locking to fix the problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49265 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
