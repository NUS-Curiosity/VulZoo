Subject: CVE-2022-48627: vt: fix memory overlapping when deleting chars in the buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vt: fix memory overlapping when deleting chars in the buffer

A memory overlapping copy occurs when deleting a long line. This memory
overlapping copy can cause data corruption when scr_memcpyw is optimized
to memcpy because memcpy does not ensure its behavior if the destination
buffer overlaps with the source buffer. The line buffer is not always
broken, because the memcpy utilizes the hardware acceleration, whose
result is not deterministic.

Fix this problem by using replacing the scr_memcpyw with scr_memmovew.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48627 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
