Subject: CVE-2022-49467: drm: msm: fix possible memory leak in mdp5_crtc_cursor_set()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: msm: fix possible memory leak in mdp5_crtc_cursor_set()

drm_gem_object_lookup will call drm_gem_object_get inside. So cursor_bo
needs to be put when msm_gem_get_and_pin_iova fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49467 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
