The warning indicates that MSR_EE being set(interrupt enabled) when
there was an overflown PMC detected. This could happen in
power_pmu_disable since it runs under interrupt soft disable
condition ( local_irq_save ) and not with interrupts hard disabled.
commit 2c9ac51b850d ("powerpc/perf: Fix PMU callbacks to clear
pending PMI before resetting an overflown PMC") intended to clear
PMI pending bit in Paca when disabling the PMU. It could happen
that PMC gets overflown while code is in power_pmu_disable
callback function. Hence add a check to see if PMI pending bit
is set in Paca before clearing it via clear_pmi_pending.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48752 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
