Subject: CVE-2022-48636: s390/dasd: fix Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev due to missing pavgroup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/dasd: fix Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev due to missing pavgroup

Fix Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev() function caused by the pavgroup
pointer being NULL.

The pavgroup pointer is checked on the entrance of the function but
without the lcu->lock being held. Therefore there is a race window
between dasd_alias_get_start_dev() and _lcu_update() which sets
pavgroup to NULL with the lcu->lock held.

Fix by checking the pavgroup pointer with lcu->lock held.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48636 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
