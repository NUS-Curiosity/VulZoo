Subject: CVE-2022-48780: net/smc: Avoid overwriting the copies of clcsock callback functions

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: Avoid overwriting the copies of clcsock callback functions

The callback functions of clcsock will be saved and replaced during
the fallback. But if the fallback happens more than once, then the
copies of these callback functions will be overwritten incorrectly,
resulting in a loop call issue:

clcsk->sk_error_report
 |- smc_fback_error_report() <------------------------------|
     |- smc_fback_forward_wakeup()                          | (loop)
         |- clcsock_callback()  (incorrectly overwritten)   |
             |- smc->clcsk_error_report() ------------------|

So this patch fixes the issue by saving these function pointers only
once in the fallback and avoiding overwriting.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48780 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
