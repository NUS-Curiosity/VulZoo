Subject: CVE-2022-48707: cxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoder

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/region: Fix null pointer dereference for resetting decoder

Not all decoders have a reset callback.

The CXL specification allows a host bridge with a single root port to
have no explicit HDM decoders. Currently the region driver assumes there
are none.  As such the CXL core creates a special pass through decoder
instance without a commit/reset callback.

Prior to this patch, the ->reset() callback was called unconditionally when
calling cxl_region_decode_reset. Thus a configuration with 1 Host Bridge,
1 Root Port, and one directly attached CXL type 3 device or multiple CXL
type 3 devices attached to downstream ports of a switch can cause a null
pointer dereference.

Before the fix, a kernel crash was observed when we destroy the region, and
a pass through decoder is reset.

The issue can be reproduced as below,
    1) create a region with a CXL setup which includes a HB with a
    single root port under which a memdev is attached directly.
    2) destroy the region with cxl destroy-region regionX -f.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48707 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
