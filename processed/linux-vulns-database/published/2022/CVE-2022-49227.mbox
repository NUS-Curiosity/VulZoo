Subject: CVE-2022-49227: igc: avoid kernel warning when changing RX ring parameters

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: avoid kernel warning when changing RX ring parameters

Calling ethtool changing the RX ring parameters like this:

  $ ethtool -G eth0 rx 1024

on igc triggers kernel warnings like this:

igc_ethtool_set_ringparam() copies the igc_ring structure but neglects to
reset the xdp_rxq_info member before calling igc_setup_rx_resources().
This in turn calls xdp_rxq_info_reg() with an already registered xdp_rxq_info.

Make sure to unregister the xdp_rxq_info structure first in
igc_setup_rx_resources.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49227 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
