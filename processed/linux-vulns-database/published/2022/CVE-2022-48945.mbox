Subject: CVE-2022-48945: media: vivid: fix compose size exceed boundary

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: vivid: fix compose size exceed boundary

syzkaller found a bug:

 BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc9000a3b1000
 #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
 #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page
 PGD 100000067 P4D 100000067 PUD 10015f067 PMD 1121ca067 PTE 0
 Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
 CPU: 0 PID: 23489 Comm: vivid-000-vid-c Not tainted 6.1.0-rc1+ #512
 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.13.0-1ubuntu1.1 04/01/2014
 RIP: 0010:memcpy_erms+0x6/0x10

This is because we forget to check boundary after adjust compose->height
int V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP case. Add v4l2_rect_map_inside() to fix this problem
for this case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48945 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
