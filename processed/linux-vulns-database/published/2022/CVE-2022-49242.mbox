Subject: CVE-2022-49242: ASoC: mxs: Fix error handling in mxs_sgtl5000_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: mxs: Fix error handling in mxs_sgtl5000_probe

This function only calls of_node_put() in the regular path.
And it will cause refcount leak in error paths.
For example, when codec_np is NULL, saif_np[0] and saif_np[1]
are not NULL, it will cause leaks.

of_node_put() will check if the node pointer is NULL, so we can
call it directly to release the refcount of regular pointers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49242 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
