Subject: CVE-2022-49223: cxl/port: Hold port reference until decoder release

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/port: Hold port reference until decoder release

KASAN + DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE reports a potential use-after-free in
cxl_decoder_release() where it goes to reference its parent, a cxl_port,
to free its id back to port->decoder_ida.

 BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in to_cxl_port+0x18/0x90 [cxl_core]
 Read of size 8 at addr ffff888119270908 by task kworker/35:2/379

 CPU: 35 PID: 379 Comm: kworker/35:2 Tainted: G           OE     5.17.0-rc2+ #198

The device core only guarantees parent lifetime until all children are
unregistered. If a child needs a parent to complete its ->release()
callback that child needs to hold a reference to extend the lifetime of
the parent.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49223 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
