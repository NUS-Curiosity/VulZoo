Subject: CVE-2022-48774: dmaengine: ptdma: Fix the error handling path in pt_core_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: ptdma: Fix the error handling path in pt_core_init()

In order to free resources correctly in the error handling path of
pt_core_init(), 2 goto's have to be switched. Otherwise, some resources
will leak and we will try to release things that have not been allocated
yet.

Also move a dev_err() to a place where it is more meaningful.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48774 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
