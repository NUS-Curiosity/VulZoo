Subject: CVE-2022-49583: iavf: Fix handling of dummy receive descriptors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iavf: Fix handling of dummy receive descriptors

Fix memory leak caused by not handling dummy receive descriptor properly.
iavf_get_rx_buffer now sets the rx_buffer return value for dummy receive
descriptors. Without this patch, when the hardware writes a dummy
descriptor, iavf would not free the page allocated for the previous receive
buffer. This is an unlikely event but can still happen.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
