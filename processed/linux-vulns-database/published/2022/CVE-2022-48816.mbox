Subject: CVE-2022-48816: SUNRPC: lock against ->sock changing during sysfs read

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

SUNRPC: lock against ->sock changing during sysfs read

->sock can be set to NULL asynchronously unless ->recv_mutex is held.
So it is important to hold that mutex.  Otherwise a sysfs read can
trigger an oops.
Commit 17f09d3f619a ("SUNRPC: Check if the xprt is connected before
handling sysfs reads") appears to attempt to fix this problem, but it
only narrows the race window.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48816 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9482ab4540f5bcc869b44c067ae99b5fca16bd07
