Subject: CVE-2022-49612: power: supply: core: Fix boundary conditions in interpolation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: core: Fix boundary conditions in interpolation

The functions power_supply_temp2resist_simple and power_supply_ocv2cap_simple
handle boundary conditions incorrectly.
The change was introduced in a4585ba2050f460f749bbaf2b67bd56c41e30283
("power: supply: core: Use library interpolation").
There are two issues: First, the lines "high = i - 1" and "high = i" in ocv2cap
have the wrong order compared to temp2resist. As a consequence, ocv2cap
sets high=-1 if ocv>table[0].ocv, which causes an out-of-bounds read.
Second, the logic of temp2resist is also not correct.
Consider the case table[] = {{20, 100}, {10, 80}, {0, 60}}.
For temp=5, we expect a resistance of 70% by interpolation.
However, temp2resist sets high=low=2 and returns 60.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49612 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a762cee5d933fe4e2e1b773d60fc74fb8248d8c4
