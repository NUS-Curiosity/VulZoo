Subject: CVE-2022-49418: NFSv4: Fix free of uninitialized nfs4_label on referral lookup.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSv4: Fix free of uninitialized nfs4_label on referral lookup.

Send along the already-allocated fattr along with nfs4_fs_locations, and
drop the memcpy of fattr.  We end up growing two more allocations, but this
fixes up a crash as:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
