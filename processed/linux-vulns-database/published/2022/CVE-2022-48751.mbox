Subject: CVE-2022-48751: net/smc: Transitional solution for clcsock race issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: Transitional solution for clcsock race issue

We encountered a crash in smc_setsockopt() and it is caused by
accessing smc->clcsock after clcsock was released.

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020
 #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode

This patch tries to fix it by holding clcsock_release_lock and
checking whether clcsock has already been released before access.

In case that a crash of the same reason happens in smc_getsockopt()
or smc_switch_to_fallback(), this patch also checkes smc->clcsock
in them too. And the caller of smc_switch_to_fallback() will identify
whether fallback succeeds according to the return value.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48751 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
