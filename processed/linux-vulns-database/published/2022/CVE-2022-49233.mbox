Subject: CVE-2022-49233: drm/amd/display: Call dc_stream_release for remove link enc assignment

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Call dc_stream_release for remove link enc assignment

[Why]
A porting error resulted in the stream assignment for the link

[How]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
