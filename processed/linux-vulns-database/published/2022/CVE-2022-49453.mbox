Subject: CVE-2022-49453: soc: ti: ti_sci_pm_domains: Check for null return of devm_kcalloc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: ti: ti_sci_pm_domains: Check for null return of devm_kcalloc

The allocation funciton devm_kcalloc may fail and return a null pointer,
which would cause a null-pointer dereference later.
It might be better to check it and directly return -ENOMEM just like the
usage of devm_kcalloc in previous code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49453 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
