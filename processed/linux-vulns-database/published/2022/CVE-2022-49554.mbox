Subject: CVE-2022-49554: zsmalloc: fix races between asynchronous zspage free and page migration

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

zsmalloc: fix races between asynchronous zspage free and page migration

The asynchronous zspage free worker tries to lock a zspage's entire page
list without defending against page migration.  Since pages which haven't
yet been locked can concurrently migrate off the zspage page list while
lock_zspage() churns away, lock_zspage() can suffer from a few different
lethal races.

It can lock a page which no longer belongs to the zspage and unsafely
dereference page_private(), it can unsafely dereference a torn pointer to
the next page (since there's a data race), and it can observe a spurious
NULL pointer to the next page and thus not lock all of the zspage's pages
(since a single page migration will reconstruct the entire page list, and
create_page_chain() unconditionally zeroes out each list pointer in the
process).

Fix the races by using migrate_read_lock() in lock_zspage() to synchronize
with page migration.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49554 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
