Subject: CVE-2022-49456: bonding: fix missed rcu protection

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bonding: fix missed rcu protection

When removing the rcu_read_lock in bond_ethtool_get_ts_info() as
discussed [1], I didn't notice it could be called via setsockopt,
which doesn't hold rcu lock, as syzbot pointed:

  stack backtrace:

Fix it by adding rcu_read_lock and take a ref on the real_dev.
Since dev_hold() and dev_put() can take NULL these days, we can
skip checking if real_dev exist.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
