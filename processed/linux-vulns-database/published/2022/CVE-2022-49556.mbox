Subject: CVE-2022-49556: KVM: SVM: Use kzalloc for sev ioctl interfaces to prevent kernel data leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: Use kzalloc for sev ioctl interfaces to prevent kernel data leak

For some sev ioctl interfaces, the length parameter that is passed maybe
less than or equal to SEV_FW_BLOB_MAX_SIZE, but larger than the data
that PSP firmware returns. In this case, kmalloc will allocate memory
that is the size of the input rather than the size of the data.
Since PSP firmware doesn't fully overwrite the allocated buffer, these
sev ioctl interface may return uninitialized kernel slab memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49556 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
