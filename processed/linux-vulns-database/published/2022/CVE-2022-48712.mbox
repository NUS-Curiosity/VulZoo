Subject: CVE-2022-48712: ext4: fix error handling in ext4_fc_record_modified_inode()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix error handling in ext4_fc_record_modified_inode()

Current code does not fully takes care of krealloc() error case, which
could lead to silent memory corruption or a kernel bug.  This patch
fixes that.

Also it cleans up some duplicated error handling logic from various
functions in fast_commit.c file.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48712 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
