Subject: CVE-2022-48908: net: arcnet: com20020: Fix null-ptr-deref in com20020pci_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: arcnet: com20020: Fix null-ptr-deref in com20020pci_probe()

During driver initialization, the pointer of card info, i.e. the
variable 'ci' is required. However, the definition of
'com20020pci_id_table' reveals that this field is empty for some
devices, which will cause null pointer dereference when initializing
these devices.

The following log reveals it:

[    3.973806] KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000028-0x000000000000002f]
[    3.973819] RIP: 0010:com20020pci_probe+0x18d/0x13e0 [com20020_pci]
[    3.975181] Call Trace:

[    3.979288]  driver_probe_device+0x50/0x370

Fix this by checking whether the 'ci' is a null pointer first.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48908 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
