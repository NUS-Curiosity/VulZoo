Subject: CVE-2022-49286: tpm: use try_get_ops() in tpm-space.c

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tpm: use try_get_ops() in tpm-space.c

As part of the series conversion to remove nested TPM operations:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190205224723.19671-1-jarkko.sakkinen@linux.intel.com/

exposure of the chip->tpm_mutex was removed from much of the upper
level code.  In this conversion, tpm2_del_space() was missed.  This
didn't matter much because it's usually called closely after a
converted operation, so there's only a very tiny race window where the
chip can be removed before the space flushing is done which causes a
NULL deref on the mutex.  However, there are reports of this window
being hit in practice, so fix this by converting tpm2_del_space() to
use tpm_try_get_ops(), which performs all the teardown checks before
acquring the mutex.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49286 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
