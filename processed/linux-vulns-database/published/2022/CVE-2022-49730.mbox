Subject: CVE-2022-49730: scsi: lpfc: Resolve NULL ptr dereference after an ELS LOGO is aborted

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Resolve NULL ptr dereference after an ELS LOGO is aborted

A use-after-free crash can occur after an ELS LOGO is aborted.

Specifically, a nodelist structure is freed and then
ndlp->vport->cfg_log_verbose is dereferenced in lpfc_nlp_get() when the
discovery state machine is mistakenly called a second time with
NLP_EVT_DEVICE_RM argument.

Rework lpfc_cmpl_els_logo() to prevent the duplicate calls to release a
nodelist structure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49730 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
