Subject: CVE-2022-49136: Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix queuing commands when HCI_UNREGISTER is set

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_sync: Fix queuing commands when HCI_UNREGISTER is set

hci_cmd_sync_queue shall return an error if HCI_UNREGISTER flag has
been set as that means hci_unregister_dev has been called so it will
likely cause a uaf after the timeout as the hdev will be freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49136 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
