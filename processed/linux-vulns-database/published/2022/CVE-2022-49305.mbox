Subject: CVE-2022-49305: drivers: staging: rtl8192u: Fix deadlock in ieee80211_beacons_stop()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers: staging: rtl8192u: Fix deadlock in ieee80211_beacons_stop()

There is a deadlock in ieee80211_beacons_stop(), which is shown below:

   (Thread 1)              |      (Thread 2)
                           | ieee80211_send_beacon()
ieee80211_beacons_stop()   |  mod_timer()
 spin_lock_irqsave() //(1) |  (wait a time)
 ...                       | ieee80211_send_beacon_cb()
 del_timer_sync()          |  spin_lock_irqsave() //(2)
 (wait timer to stop)      |  ...

We hold ieee->beacon_lock in position (1) of thread 1 and use
del_timer_sync() to wait timer to stop, but timer handler
also need ieee->beacon_lock in position (2) of thread 2.
As a result, ieee80211_beacons_stop() will block forever.

This patch extracts del_timer_sync() from the protection of
spin_lock_irqsave(), which could let timer handler to obtain
the needed lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49305 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
