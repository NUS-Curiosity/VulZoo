Subject: CVE-2022-49262: crypto: octeontx2 - remove CONFIG_DM_CRYPT check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: octeontx2 - remove CONFIG_DM_CRYPT check

No issues were found while using the driver with dm-crypt enabled. So
CONFIG_DM_CRYPT check in the driver can be removed.

This also fixes the NULL pointer dereference in driver release if
CONFIG_DM_CRYPT is enabled.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
