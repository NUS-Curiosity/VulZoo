Subject: CVE-2022-49202: Bluetooth: hci_uart: add missing NULL check in h5_enqueue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_uart: add missing NULL check in h5_enqueue

Syzbot hit general protection fault in __pm_runtime_resume(). The problem
was in missing NULL check.

hu->serdev can be NULL and we should not blindly pass &serdev->dev
somewhere, since it will cause GPF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49202 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
