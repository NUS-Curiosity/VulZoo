Subject: CVE-2022-48904: iommu/amd: Fix I/O page table memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/amd: Fix I/O page table memory leak

The current logic updates the I/O page table mode for the domain
before calling the logic to free memory used for the page table.
This results in IOMMU page table memory leak, and can be observed
when launching VM w/ pass-through devices.

Fix by freeing the memory used for page table before updating the mode.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48904 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
