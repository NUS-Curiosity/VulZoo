Subject: CVE-2022-48861: vdpa: fix use-after-free on vp_vdpa_remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vdpa: fix use-after-free on vp_vdpa_remove

When vp_vdpa driver is unbind, vp_vdpa is freed in vdpa_unregister_device
and then vp_vdpa->mdev.pci_dev is dereferenced in vp_modern_remove,
triggering use-after-free.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
