Subject: CVE-2022-48950: perf: Fix perf_pending_task() UaF

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf: Fix perf_pending_task() UaF

Per syzbot it is possible for perf_pending_task() to run after the
event is free()'d. There are two related but distinct cases:

 - the task_work was already queued before destroying the event;
 - destroying the event itself queues the task_work.

The first cannot be solved using task_work_cancel() since
perf_release() itself might be called from a task_work (____fput),
which means the current->task_works list is already empty and
task_work_cancel() won't be able to find the perf_pending_task()
entry.

The simplest alternative is extending the perf_event lifetime to cover
the task_work.

The second is just silly, queueing a task_work while you know the
event is going away makes no sense and is easily avoided by
re-arranging how the event is marked STATE_DEAD and ensuring it goes
through STATE_OFF on the way down.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48950 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
