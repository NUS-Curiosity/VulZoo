Subject: CVE-2022-48819: tcp: take care of mixed splice()/sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY) case

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: take care of mixed splice()/sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY) case

syzbot found that mixing sendpage() and sendmsg(MSG_ZEROCOPY)
calls over the same TCP socket would again trigger the
infamous warning in inet_sock_destruct()

	WARN_ON(sk_forward_alloc_get(sk));

While Talal took into account a mix of regular copied data
and MSG_ZEROCOPY one in the same skb, the sendpage() path
has been forgotten.

We want the charging to happen for sendpage(), because
pages could be coming from a pipe. What is missing is the
downgrading of pure zerocopy status to make sure
sk_forward_alloc will stay synced.

Add tcp_downgrade_zcopy_pure() helper so that we can
use it from the two callers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48819 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
