Subject: CVE-2022-49508: HID: elan: Fix potential double free in elan_input_configured

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: elan: Fix potential double free in elan_input_configured

'input' is a managed resource allocated with devm_input_allocate_device(),
so there is no need to call input_free_device() explicitly or
there will be a double free.

According to the doc of devm_input_allocate_device():
 * Managed input devices do not need to be explicitly unregistered or
 * freed as it will be done automatically when owner device unbinds from
 * its driver (or binding fails).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49508 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
