Subject: CVE-2022-49267: mmc: core: use sysfs_emit() instead of sprintf()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: core: use sysfs_emit() instead of sprintf()

sprintf() (still used in the MMC core for the sysfs output) is vulnerable
to the buffer overflow.  Use the new-fangled sysfs_emit() instead.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static
analysis tool.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49267 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
