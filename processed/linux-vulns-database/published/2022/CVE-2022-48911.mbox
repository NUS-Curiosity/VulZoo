Subject: CVE-2022-48911: netfilter: nf_queue: fix possible use-after-free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_queue: fix possible use-after-free

Eric Dumazet says:
  The sock_hold() side seems suspect, because there is no guarantee
  that sk_refcnt is not already 0.

On failure, we cannot queue the packet and need to indicate an
error.  The packet will be dropped by the caller.

v2: split skb prefetch hunk into separate change

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48911 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
