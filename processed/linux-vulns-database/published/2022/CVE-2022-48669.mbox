Subject: CVE-2022-48669: powerpc/pseries: Fix potential memleak in papr_get_attr()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pseries: Fix potential memleak in papr_get_attr()

`buf` is allocated in papr_get_attr(), and krealloc() of `buf`
could fail. We need to free the original `buf` in the case of failure.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
