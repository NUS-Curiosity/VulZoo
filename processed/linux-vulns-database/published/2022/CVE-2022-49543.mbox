Reason is mhi_deassert_dev_wake() from mhi_device_put() is called
but mhi_assert_dev_wake() from __mhi_device_get_sync() is not called
in progress of recovery. Commit 8e0559921f9a ("bus: mhi: core:
Skip device wake in error or shutdown state") add check for the
pm_state of mhi in __mhi_device_get_sync(), and the pm_state is not
the normal state untill recovery is completed, so it leads the
dev_wake is not 0 and above warning print in mhi_pm_disable_transition()
while checking mhi_cntrl->dev_wake.

Add check in ath11k_pci_write32()/ath11k_pci_read32() to skip call
mhi_device_put() if mhi_device_get_sync() does not really do wake,
then the warning gone.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
