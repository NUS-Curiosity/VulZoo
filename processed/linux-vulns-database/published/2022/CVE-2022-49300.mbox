Subject: CVE-2022-49300: nbd: fix race between nbd_alloc_config() and module removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: fix race between nbd_alloc_config() and module removal

When nbd module is being removing, nbd_alloc_config() may be
called concurrently by nbd_genl_connect(), although try_module_get()
will return false, but nbd_alloc_config() doesn't handle it.

The race may lead to the leak of nbd_config and its related
resources (e.g, recv_workq) and oops in nbd_read_stat() due
to the unload of nbd module as shown below:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000040
  Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
  CPU: 5 PID: 13840 Comm: kworker/u17:33 Not tainted 5.14.0+ #1
  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996)
  Workqueue: knbd16-recv recv_work [nbd]
  RIP: 0010:nbd_read_stat.cold+0x130/0x1a4 [nbd]
  Call Trace:
   recv_work+0x3b/0xb0 [nbd]
   process_one_work+0x1ed/0x390
   worker_thread+0x4a/0x3d0
   kthread+0x12a/0x150
   ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30

Fixing it by checking the return value of try_module_get()
in nbd_alloc_config(). As nbd_alloc_config() may return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV),
assign nbd->config only when nbd_alloc_config() succeeds to ensure
the value of nbd->config is binary (valid or NULL).

Also adding a debug message to check the reference counter
of nbd_config during module removal.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49300 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
