Subject: CVE-2022-48848: tracing/osnoise: Do not unregister events twice

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/osnoise: Do not unregister events twice

Nicolas reported that using:

 # trace-cmd record -e all -M 10 -p osnoise --poll

Resulted in the following kernel warning:

 ------------[ cut here ]------------

 ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---

The warning complains about an attempt to unregister an
unregistered tracepoint.

This happens on trace-cmd because it first stops tracing, and
then switches the tracer to nop. Which is equivalent to:

  # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
  # echo osnoise > current_tracer
  # echo 0 > tracing_on
  # echo nop > current_tracer

The osnoise tracer stops the workload when no trace instance
is actually collecting data. This can be caused both by
disabling tracing or disabling the tracer itself.

To avoid unregistering events twice, use the existing
trace_osnoise_callback_enabled variable to check if the events
(and the workload) are actually active before trying to
deactivate them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48848 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4e10787d18379d9b296290c2288097feddef16d4
