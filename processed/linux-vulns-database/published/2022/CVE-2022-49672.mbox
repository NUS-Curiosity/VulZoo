Subject: CVE-2022-49672: net: tun: unlink NAPI from device on destruction

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: tun: unlink NAPI from device on destruction

Syzbot found a race between tun file and device destruction.
NAPIs live in struct tun_file which can get destroyed before
the netdev so we have to del them explicitly. The current
code is missing deleting the NAPI if the queue was detached
first.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49672 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
