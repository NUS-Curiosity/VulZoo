Subject: CVE-2022-48884: net/mlx5: Fix command stats access after free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix command stats access after free

Command may fail while driver is reloading and can't accept FW commands
till command interface is reinitialized. Such command failure is being
logged to command stats. This results in NULL pointer access as command
stats structure is being freed and reallocated during mlx5 devlink
reload (see kernel log below).

Fix it by making command stats statically allocated on driver probe.

	drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/cmd.c
	include/linux/mlx5/driver.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ddf458641a511e7dff19f3bf0cbbc5dd9fe08ce5
