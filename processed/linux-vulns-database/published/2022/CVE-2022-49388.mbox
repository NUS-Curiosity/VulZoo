Subject: CVE-2022-49388: ubi: ubi_create_volume: Fix use-after-free when volume creation failed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubi: ubi_create_volume: Fix use-after-free when volume creation failed

There is an use-after-free problem for 'eba_tbl' in ubi_create_volume()'s
error handling path:

  ubi_eba_replace_table(vol, eba_tbl)
    vol->eba_tbl = tbl
out_mapping:
  ubi_eba_destroy_table(eba_tbl)   // Free 'eba_tbl'
out_unlock:
  put_device(&vol->dev)
    vol_release
      kfree(tbl->entries)	  // UAF

Fix it by removing redundant 'eba_tbl' releasing.
Fetch a reproducer in [Link].

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49388 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
