Subject: CVE-2022-49361: f2fs: fix to do sanity check for inline inode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to do sanity check for inline inode

Yanming reported a kernel bug in Bugzilla kernel [1], which can be
reproduced. The bug message is:

The kernel message is shown below:

kernel BUG at fs/inode.c:611!
Call Trace:
 evict+0x282/0x4e0
 __dentry_kill+0x2b2/0x4d0
 dput+0x2dd/0x720
 do_renameat2+0x596/0x970
 __x64_sys_rename+0x78/0x90
 do_syscall_64+0x3b/0x90

[1] https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215895

The bug is due to fuzzed inode has both inline_data and encrypted flags.
During f2fs_evict_inode(), as the inode was deleted by rename(), it
will cause inline data conversion due to conflicting flags. The page
cache will be polluted and the panic will be triggered in clear_inode().

Try fixing the bug by doing more sanity checks for inline data inode in
sanity_check_inode().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49361 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
