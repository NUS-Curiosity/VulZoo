Subject: CVE-2022-48991: mm/khugepaged: invoke MMU notifiers in shmem/file collapse paths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/khugepaged: invoke MMU notifiers in shmem/file collapse paths

Any codepath that zaps page table entries must invoke MMU notifiers to
ensure that secondary MMUs (like KVM) don't keep accessing pages which
aren't mapped anymore.  Secondary MMUs don't hold their own references to
pages that are mirrored over, so failing to notify them can lead to page
use-after-free.

I'm marking this as addressing an issue introduced in commit f3f0e1d2150b
("khugepaged: add support of collapse for tmpfs/shmem pages"), but most of
the security impact of this only came in commit 27e1f8273113 ("khugepaged:
enable collapse pmd for pte-mapped THP"), which actually omitted flushes
for the removal of present PTEs, not just for the removal of empty page
tables.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48991 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
