Subject: CVE-2022-49427: iommu/mediatek: Remove clk_disable in mtk_iommu_remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/mediatek: Remove clk_disable in mtk_iommu_remove

After the commit b34ea31fe013 ("iommu/mediatek: Always enable the clk on
resume"), the iommu clock is controlled by the runtime callback.
thus remove the clk control in the mtk_iommu_remove.

Otherwise, it will warning like:

echo 14018000.iommu > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/mtk-iommu/unbind

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
