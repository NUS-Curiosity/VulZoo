Subject: CVE-2022-49307: tty: synclink_gt: Fix null-pointer-dereference in slgt_clean()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: synclink_gt: Fix null-pointer-dereference in slgt_clean()

When the driver fails at alloc_hdlcdev(), and then we remove the driver
module, we will get the following splat:

[   25.065966] general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000182: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI
[   25.066914] KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000c10-0x0000000000000c17]
[   25.069262] RIP: 0010:detach_hdlc_protocol+0x2a/0x3e0
[   25.077709] Call Trace:
[   25.077924]  <TASK>
[   25.078108]  unregister_hdlc_device+0x16/0x30
[   25.078481]  slgt_cleanup+0x157/0x9f0 [synclink_gt]

Fix this by checking whether the 'info->netdev' is a null pointer first.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49307 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
