Subject: CVE-2022-49173: spi: fsi: Implement a timeout for polling status

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: fsi: Implement a timeout for polling status

The data transfer routines must poll the status register to
determine when more data can be shifted in or out. If the hardware
gets into a bad state, these polling loops may never exit. Prevent
this by returning an error if a timeout is exceeded.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49173 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
