Subject: CVE-2022-49474: Bluetooth: fix dangling sco_conn and use-after-free in sco_sock_timeout

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: fix dangling sco_conn and use-after-free in sco_sock_timeout

Connecting the same socket twice consecutively in sco_sock_connect()
could lead to a race condition where two sco_conn objects are created
but only one is associated with the socket. If the socket is closed
before the SCO connection is established, the timer associated with the
dangling sco_conn object won't be canceled. As the sock object is being
freed, the use-after-free problem happens when the timer callback
function sco_sock_timeout() accesses the socket. Here's the call trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
