Subject: CVE-2022-49296: ceph: fix possible deadlock when holding Fwb to get inline_data

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix possible deadlock when holding Fwb to get inline_data

1, mount with wsync.
2, create a file with O_RDWR, and the request was sent to mds.0:

   ceph_atomic_open()-->
     ceph_mdsc_do_request(openc)
     finish_open(file, dentry, ceph_open)-->
       ceph_open()-->
         ceph_init_file()-->
           ceph_init_file_info()-->
             ceph_uninline_data()-->
             {
               ...
               if (inline_version == 1 || /* initial version, no data */
                   inline_version == CEPH_INLINE_NONE)
                     goto out_unlock;
               ...
             }

The inline_version will be 1, which is the initial version for the
new create file. And here the ci->i_inline_version will keep with 1,
it's buggy.

3, buffer write to the file immediately:

   ceph_write_iter()-->
     ceph_get_caps(file, need=Fw, want=Fb, ...);
     generic_perform_write()-->
       a_ops->write_begin()-->
         ceph_write_begin()-->
           netfs_write_begin()-->
             netfs_begin_read()-->
               netfs_rreq_submit_slice()-->
                 netfs_read_from_server()-->
                   rreq->netfs_ops->issue_read()-->
                     ceph_netfs_issue_read()-->
                     {
                       ...
                       if (ci->i_inline_version != CEPH_INLINE_NONE &&
                           ceph_netfs_issue_op_inline(subreq))
                         return;
                       ...
                     }
     ceph_put_cap_refs(ci, Fwb);

The ceph_netfs_issue_op_inline() will send a getattr(Fsr) request to
mds.1.

4, then the mds.1 will request the rd lock for CInode::filelock from
the auth mds.0, the mds.0 will do the CInode::filelock state transation
from excl --> sync, but it need to revoke the Fxwb caps back from the
clients.

While the kernel client has aleady held the Fwb caps and waiting for
the getattr(Fsr).

It's deadlock!

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/292b7a7275ce535a1abfa4dd0b2e586162aaae1e
