Subject: CVE-2022-48720: net: macsec: Fix offload support for NETDEV_UNREGISTER event

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: macsec: Fix offload support for NETDEV_UNREGISTER event

Current macsec netdev notify handler handles NETDEV_UNREGISTER event by
releasing relevant SW resources only, this causes resources leak in case
of macsec HW offload, as the underlay driver was not notified to clean
it's macsec offload resources.

Fix by calling the underlay driver to clean it's relevant resources
by moving offload handling from macsec_dellink() to macsec_common_dellink()
when handling NETDEV_UNREGISTER event.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48720 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
