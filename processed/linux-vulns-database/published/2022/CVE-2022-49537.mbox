Subject: CVE-2022-49537: scsi: lpfc: Fix call trace observed during I/O with CMF enabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix call trace observed during I/O with CMF enabled

The following was seen with CMF enabled:

BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible
code: systemd-udevd/31711
kernel: caller is lpfc_update_cmf_cmd+0x214/0x420  [lpfc]
kernel: CPU: 12 PID: 31711 Comm: systemd-udevd
kernel: Call Trace:
kernel: <TASK>
kernel: dump_stack_lvl+0x44/0x57
kernel: check_preemption_disabled+0xbf/0xe0
kernel: lpfc_update_cmf_cmd+0x214/0x420 [lpfc]
kernel: lpfc_nvme_fcp_io_submit+0x23b4/0x4df0 [lpfc]

this_cpu_ptr() calls smp_processor_id() in a preemptible context.

Fix by using per_cpu_ptr() with raw_smp_processor_id() instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49537 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
