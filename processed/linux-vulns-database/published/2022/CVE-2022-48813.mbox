Subject: CVE-2022-48813: net: dsa: felix: don't use devres for mdiobus

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: felix: don't use devres for mdiobus

As explained in commits:
74b6d7d13307 ("net: dsa: realtek: register the MDIO bus under devres")
5135e96a3dd2 ("net: dsa: don't allocate the slave_mii_bus using devres")

mdiobus_free() will panic when called from devm_mdiobus_free() <-
devres_release_all() <- __device_release_driver(), and that mdiobus was
not previously unregistered.

The Felix VSC9959 switch is a PCI device, so the initial set of
constraints that I thought would cause this (I2C or SPI buses which call
->remove on ->shutdown) do not apply. But there is one more which
applies here.

If the DSA master itself is on a bus that calls ->remove from ->shutdown
(like dpaa2-eth, which is on the fsl-mc bus), there is a device link
between the switch and the DSA master, and device_links_unbind_consumers()
will unbind the felix switch driver on shutdown.

So the same treatment must be applied to all DSA switch drivers, which
is: either use devres for both the mdiobus allocation and registration,
or don't use devres at all.

The felix driver has the code structure in place for orderly mdiobus
removal, so just replace devm_mdiobus_alloc_size() with the non-devres
variant, and add manual free where necessary, to ensure that we don't
let devres free a still-registered bus.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48813 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
