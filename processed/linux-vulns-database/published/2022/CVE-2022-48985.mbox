Subject: CVE-2022-48985: net: mana: Fix race on per-CQ variable napi work_done

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mana: Fix race on per-CQ variable napi work_done

After calling napi_complete_done(), the NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit may be
cleared, and another CPU can start napi thread and access per-CQ variable,
cq->work_done. If the other thread (for example, from busy_poll) sets
it to a value >= budget, this thread will continue to run when it should
stop, and cause memory corruption and panic.

To fix this issue, save the per-CQ work_done variable in a local variable
before napi_complete_done(), so it won't be corrupted by a possible
concurrent thread after napi_complete_done().

Also, add a flag bit to advertise to the NIC firmware: the NAPI work_done
variable race is fixed, so the driver is able to reliably support features
like busy_poll.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48985 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
