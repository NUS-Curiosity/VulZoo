Subject: CVE-2022-48972: mac802154: fix missing INIT_LIST_HEAD in ieee802154_if_add()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mac802154: fix missing INIT_LIST_HEAD in ieee802154_if_add()

Kernel fault injection test reports null-ptr-deref as follows:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008
RIP: 0010:cfg802154_netdev_notifier_call+0x120/0x310 include/linux/list.h:114

ieee802154_if_add() allocates wpan_dev as netdev's private data, but not
init the list in struct wpan_dev. cfg802154_netdev_notifier_call() manage
the list when device register/unregister, and may lead to null-ptr-deref.

Use INIT_LIST_HEAD() on it to initialize it correctly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48972 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
