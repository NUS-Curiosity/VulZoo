Subject: CVE-2022-49258: crypto: ccree - Fix use after free in cc_cipher_exit()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: ccree - Fix use after free in cc_cipher_exit()

kfree_sensitive(ctx_p->user.key) will free the ctx_p->user.key. But
ctx_p->user.key is still used in the next line, which will lead to a
use after free.

We can call kfree_sensitive() after dev_dbg() to avoid the uaf.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49258 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
