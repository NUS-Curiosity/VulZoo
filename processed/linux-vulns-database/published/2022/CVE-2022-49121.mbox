Subject: CVE-2022-49121: scsi: pm8001: Fix tag leaks on error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm8001: Fix tag leaks on error

In pm8001_chip_set_dev_state_req(), pm8001_chip_fw_flash_update_req(),
pm80xx_chip_phy_ctl_req() and pm8001_chip_reg_dev_req() add missing calls
to pm8001_tag_free() to free the allocated tag when pm8001_mpi_build_cmd()
fails.

Similarly, in pm8001_exec_internal_task_abort(), if the chip ->task_abort
method fails, the tag allocated for the abort request task must be
freed. Add the missing call to pm8001_tag_free().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49121 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
