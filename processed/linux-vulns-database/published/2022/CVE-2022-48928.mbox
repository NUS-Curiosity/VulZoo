Subject: CVE-2022-48928: iio: adc: men_z188_adc: Fix a resource leak in an error handling path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: men_z188_adc: Fix a resource leak in an error handling path

If iio_device_register() fails, a previous ioremap() is left unbalanced.

Update the error handling path and add the missing iounmap() call, as
already done in the remove function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48928 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
