Subject: CVE-2022-49132: ath11k: pci: fix crash on suspend if board file is not found

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ath11k: pci: fix crash on suspend if board file is not found

Mario reported that the kernel was crashing on suspend if ath11k was not able
to find a board file:

The issue here is that board file loading happens after ath11k_pci_probe()
succesfully returns (ath11k initialisation happends asynchronously) and the
suspend handler is still enabled, of course failing as ath11k is not properly
initialised. Fix this by checking ATH11K_FLAG_QMI_FAIL during both suspend and
resume.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
