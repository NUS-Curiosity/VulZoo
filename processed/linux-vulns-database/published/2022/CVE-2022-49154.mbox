Subject: CVE-2022-49154: KVM: SVM: fix panic on out-of-bounds guest IRQ

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: fix panic on out-of-bounds guest IRQ

As guest_irq is coming from KVM_IRQFD API call, it may trigger
crash in svm_update_pi_irte() due to out-of-bounds:

Vmx have been fix this in commit 3a8b0677fc61 (KVM: VMX: Do not BUG() on
out-of-bounds guest IRQ), so we can just copy source from that to fix
this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49154 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
