Subject: CVE-2022-49442: drivers/base/node.c: fix compaction sysfs file leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/base/node.c: fix compaction sysfs file leak

Compaction sysfs file is created via compaction_register_node in
register_node.  But we forgot to remove it in unregister_node.  Thus
compaction sysfs file is leaked.  Using compaction_unregister_node to fix
this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
