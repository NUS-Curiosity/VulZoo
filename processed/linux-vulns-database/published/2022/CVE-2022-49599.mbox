Subject: CVE-2022-49599: tcp: Fix data-races around sysctl_tcp_l3mdev_accept.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: Fix data-races around sysctl_tcp_l3mdev_accept.

While reading sysctl_tcp_l3mdev_accept, it can be changed concurrently.
Thus, we need to add READ_ONCE() to its readers.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
