Subject: CVE-2022-49348: ext4: filter out EXT4_FC_REPLAY from on-disk superblock field s_state

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: filter out EXT4_FC_REPLAY from on-disk superblock field s_state

The EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit in sbi->s_mount_state is used to indicate that
we are in the middle of replay the fast commit journal.  This was
actually a mistake, since the sbi->s_mount_info is initialized from
es->s_state.  Arguably s_mount_state is misleadingly named, but the
name is historical --- s_mount_state and s_state dates back to ext2.

What should have been used is the ext4_{set,clear,test}_mount_flag()
inline functions, which sets EXT4_MF_* bits in sbi->s_mount_flags.

The problem with using EXT4_FC_REPLAY is that a maliciously corrupted
superblock could result in EXT4_FC_REPLAY getting set in
s_mount_state.  This bypasses some sanity checks, and this can trigger
a BUG() in ext4_es_cache_extent().  As a easy-to-backport-fix, filter
out the EXT4_FC_REPLAY bit for now.  We should eventually transition
away from EXT4_FC_REPLAY to something like EXT4_MF_REPLAY.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49348 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
