Subject: CVE-2022-48874: misc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free and race in fastrpc_map_find

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: fastrpc: Fix use-after-free and race in fastrpc_map_find

Currently, there is a race window between the point when the mutex is
unlocked in fastrpc_map_lookup and the reference count increasing
(fastrpc_map_get) in fastrpc_map_find, which can also lead to
use-after-free.

So lets merge fastrpc_map_find into fastrpc_map_lookup which allows us
to both protect the maps list by also taking the &fl->lock spinlock and
the reference count, since the spinlock will be released only after.
Add take_ref argument to make this suitable for all callers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48874 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
