Subject: CVE-2022-49617: ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: handle errors on card registration

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: handle errors on card registration

If the card registration fails, typically because of deferred probes,
the device properties added for headset codecs are not removed, which
leads to kernel oopses in driver bind/unbind tests.

We already clean-up the device properties when the card is removed,
this code can be moved as a helper and called upon card registration
errors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49617 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
