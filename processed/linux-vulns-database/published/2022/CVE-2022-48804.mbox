Subject: CVE-2022-48804: vt_ioctl: fix array_index_nospec in vt_setactivate

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vt_ioctl: fix array_index_nospec in vt_setactivate

array_index_nospec ensures that an out-of-bounds value is set to zero
on the transient path. Decreasing the value by one afterwards causes
a transient integer underflow. vsa.console should be decreased first
and then sanitized with array_index_nospec.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
