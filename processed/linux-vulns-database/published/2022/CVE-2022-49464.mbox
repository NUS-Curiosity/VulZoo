Subject: CVE-2022-49464: erofs: fix buffer copy overflow of ztailpacking feature

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix buffer copy overflow of ztailpacking feature

I got some KASAN report as below:

[   46.959738] ==================================================================
[   46.960430] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in z_erofs_shifted_transform+0x2bd/0x370

The root cause is that the tail pcluster won't be a complete filesystem
block anymore. So if ztailpacking is used, the second part of an
uncompressed tail pcluster may not be ``rq->pageofs_out``.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49464 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4d53a625f29074e7b8236c2c0e0922edb7608df9
