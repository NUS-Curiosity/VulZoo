Subject: CVE-2022-48976: netfilter: flowtable_offload: fix using __this_cpu_add in preemptible

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: flowtable_offload: fix using __this_cpu_add in preemptible

flow_offload_queue_work() can be called in workqueue without
bh disabled, like the call trace showed in my act_ct testing,
calling NF_FLOW_TABLE_STAT_INC() there would cause a call
trace:

  BUG: using __this_cpu_add() in preemptible [00000000] code: kworker/u4:0/138560
  caller is flow_offload_queue_work+0xec/0x1b0 [nf_flow_table]
  Workqueue: act_ct_workqueue tcf_ct_flow_table_cleanup_work [act_ct]
  Call Trace:

   process_one_work+0x6a3/0x1030
   worker_thread+0x8a/0xdf0

This patch fixes it by using NF_FLOW_TABLE_STAT_INC_ATOMIC()
instead in flow_offload_queue_work().

Note that for FLOW_CLS_REPLACE branch in flow_offload_queue_work(),
it may not be called in preemptible path, but it's good to use
NF_FLOW_TABLE_STAT_INC_ATOMIC() for all cases in
flow_offload_queue_work().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48976 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a220a11fda012fba506b35929672374c2723ae6d
