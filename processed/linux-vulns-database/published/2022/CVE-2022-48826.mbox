Subject: CVE-2022-48826: drm/vc4: Fix deadlock on DSI device attach error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vc4: Fix deadlock on DSI device attach error

DSI device attach to DSI host will be done with host device's lock
held.

Un-registering host in "device attach" error path (ex: probe retry)
will result in deadlock with below call trace and non operational
DSI display.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
