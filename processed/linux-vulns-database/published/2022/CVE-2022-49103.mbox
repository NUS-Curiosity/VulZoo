Subject: CVE-2022-49103: NFSv4.2: fix reference count leaks in _nfs42_proc_copy_notify()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSv4.2: fix reference count leaks in _nfs42_proc_copy_notify()

[You don't often get email from xiongx18@fudan.edu.cn. Learn why this is important at http://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification.]

The reference counting issue happens in two error paths in the
function _nfs42_proc_copy_notify(). In both error paths, the function
simply returns the error code and forgets to balance the refcount of
object `ctx`, bumped by get_nfs_open_context() earlier, which may
cause refcount leaks.

Fix it by balancing refcount of the `ctx` object before the function
returns in both error paths.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49103 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
