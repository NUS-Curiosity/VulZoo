Subject: CVE-2022-49376: scsi: sd: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: sd: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

If sd_probe() sees an early error before sdkp->device is initialized,
sd_zbc_release_disk() is called. This causes a NULL pointer dereference
when sd_is_zoned() is called inside that function. Avoid this by removing
the call to sd_zbc_release_disk() in sd_probe() error path.

This change is safe and does not result in zone information memory leakage
because the zone information for a zoned disk is allocated only when
sd_revalidate_disk() is called, at which point sdkp->disk_dev is fully set,
resulting in sd_disk_release() being called when needed to cleanup a disk
zone information using sd_zbc_release_disk().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49376 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
