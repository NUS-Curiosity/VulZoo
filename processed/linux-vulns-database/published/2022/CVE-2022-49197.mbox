Subject: CVE-2022-49197: af_netlink: Fix shift out of bounds in group mask calculation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_netlink: Fix shift out of bounds in group mask calculation

When a netlink message is received, netlink_recvmsg() fills in the address
of the sender. One of the fields is the 32-bit bitfield nl_groups, which
carries the multicast group on which the message was received. The least
significant bit corresponds to group 1, and therefore the highest group
that the field can represent is 32. Above that, the UB sanitizer flags the
out-of-bounds shift attempts.

Which bits end up being set in such case is implementation defined, but
it's either going to be a wrong non-zero value, or zero, which is at least
not misleading. Make the latter choice deterministic by always setting to 0
for higher-numbered multicast groups.

To get information about membership in groups >= 32, userspace is expected
to use nl_pktinfo control messages[0], which are enabled by NETLINK_PKTINFO
socket option.

The way to trigger this issue is e.g. through monitoring the BRVLAN group:

	# bridge monitor vlan &
	# ip link add name br type bridge

Which produces the following citation:

	UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in net/netlink/af_netlink.c:162:19
	shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49197 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
