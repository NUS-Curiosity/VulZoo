Subject: CVE-2022-49235: ath9k_htc: fix uninit value bugs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ath9k_htc: fix uninit value bugs

Syzbot reported 2 KMSAN bugs in ath9k. All of them are caused by missing
field initialization.

In htc_connect_service() svc_meta_len and pad are not initialized. Based
on code it looks like in current skb there is no service data, so simply
initialize svc_meta_len to 0.

htc_issue_send() does not initialize htc_frame_hdr::control array. Based
on firmware code, it will initialize it by itself, so simply zero whole
array to make KMSAN happy

Fail logs:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
