Subject: CVE-2022-49064: cachefiles: unmark inode in use in error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachefiles: unmark inode in use in error path

Unmark inode in use if error encountered. If the in-use flag leakage
occurs in cachefiles_open_file(), Cachefiles will complain "Inode
already in use" when later another cookie with the same index key is
looked up.

If the in-use flag leakage occurs in cachefiles_create_tmpfile(), though
the "Inode already in use" warning won't be triggered, fix the leakage
anyway.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49064 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
