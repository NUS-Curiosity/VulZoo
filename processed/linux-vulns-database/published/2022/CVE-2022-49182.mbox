Subject: CVE-2022-49182: net: hns3: add vlan list lock to protect vlan list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: add vlan list lock to protect vlan list

When adding port base VLAN, vf VLAN need to remove from HW and modify
the vlan state in vf VLAN list as false. If the periodicity task is
freeing the same node, it may cause "use after free" error.
This patch adds a vlan list lock to protect the vlan list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49182 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
