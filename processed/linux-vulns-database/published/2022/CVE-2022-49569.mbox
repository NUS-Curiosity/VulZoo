Subject: CVE-2022-49569: spi: bcm2835: bcm2835_spi_handle_err(): fix NULL pointer deref for non DMA transfers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: bcm2835: bcm2835_spi_handle_err(): fix NULL pointer deref for non DMA transfers

In case a IRQ based transfer times out the bcm2835_spi_handle_err()
function is called. Since commit 1513ceee70f2 ("spi: bcm2835: Drop
dma_pending flag") the TX and RX DMA transfers are unconditionally
canceled, leading to NULL pointer derefs if ctlr->dma_tx or
ctlr->dma_rx are not set.

Fix the NULL pointer deref by checking that ctlr->dma_tx and
ctlr->dma_rx are valid pointers before accessing them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49569 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
