Subject: CVE-2022-49261: drm/i915/gem: add missing boundary check in vm_access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/gem: add missing boundary check in vm_access

A missing bounds check in vm_access() can lead to an out-of-bounds read
or write in the adjacent memory area, since the len attribute is not
validated before the memcpy later in the function, potentially hitting:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
