Subject: CVE-2022-49184: net: sparx5: switchdev: fix possible NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sparx5: switchdev: fix possible NULL pointer dereference

As the possible failure of the allocation, devm_kzalloc() may return NULL
pointer.
Therefore, it should be better to check the 'db' in order to prevent
the dereference of NULL pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49184 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
