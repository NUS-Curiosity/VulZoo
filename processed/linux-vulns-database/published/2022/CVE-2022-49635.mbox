Subject: CVE-2022-49635: drm/i915/selftests: fix subtraction overflow bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/selftests: fix subtraction overflow bug

On some machines hole_end can be small enough to cause subtraction
overflow. On the other side (addr + 2 * min_alignment) can overflow
in case of mock tests. This patch should handle both cases.

(cherry picked from commit ab3edc679c552a466e4bf0b11af3666008bd65a2)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49635 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e8997d2d6b8d764e12489f1af2a1ce1d7384ca2a
