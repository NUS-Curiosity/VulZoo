Subject: CVE-2022-48673: net/smc: Fix possible access to freed memory in link clear

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: Fix possible access to freed memory in link clear

After modifying the QP to the Error state, all RX WR would be completed
with WC in IB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR status. Current implementation does not
wait for it is done, but destroy the QP and free the link group directly.
So there is a risk that accessing the freed memory in tasklet context.

Here is a crash example:

 BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffff8f220860
 #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
 #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
