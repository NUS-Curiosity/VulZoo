Subject: CVE-2022-48896: ixgbe: fix pci device refcount leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ixgbe: fix pci device refcount leak

As the comment of pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot() says, it
returns a PCI device with refcount incremented, when finish
using it, the caller must decrement the reference count by
calling pci_dev_put().

In ixgbe_get_first_secondary_devfn() and ixgbe_x550em_a_has_mii(),
pci_dev_put() is called to avoid leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48896 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
