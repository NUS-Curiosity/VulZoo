Subject: CVE-2022-49406: block: Fix potential deadlock in blk_ia_range_sysfs_show()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Fix potential deadlock in blk_ia_range_sysfs_show()

When being read, a sysfs attribute is already protected against removal
with the kobject node active reference counter. As a result, in
blk_ia_range_sysfs_show(), there is no need to take the queue sysfs
lock when reading the value of a range attribute. Using the queue sysfs
lock in this function creates a potential deadlock situation with the
disk removal, something that a lockdep signals with a splat when the
device is removed:

[  760.703551]  Possible unsafe locking scenario:
[  760.703551]
[  760.703554]        CPU0                    CPU1
[  760.703556]        ----                    ----
[  760.703558]   lock(&q->sysfs_lock);
[  760.703565]                                lock(kn->active#385);
[  760.703573]                                lock(&q->sysfs_lock);
[  760.703579]   lock(kn->active#385);
[  760.703587]
[  760.703587]  *** DEADLOCK ***

Solve this by removing the mutex_lock()/mutex_unlock() calls from
blk_ia_range_sysfs_show().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49406 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dc107c805cde709866b59867ef72b9390199205e
