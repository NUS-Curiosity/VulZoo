Subject: CVE-2022-48787: iwlwifi: fix use-after-free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iwlwifi: fix use-after-free

If no firmware was present at all (or, presumably, all of the
firmware files failed to parse), we end up unbinding by calling
device_release_driver(), which calls remove(), which then in
iwlwifi calls iwl_drv_stop(), freeing the 'drv' struct. However
the new code I added will still erroneously access it after it
was freed.

Set 'failure=false' in this case to avoid the access, all data
was already freed anyway.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48787 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
