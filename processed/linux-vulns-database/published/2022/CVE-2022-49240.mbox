Subject: CVE-2022-49240: ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Fix error handling in mt8195_mt6359_rt1019_rt5682_dev_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: mediatek: mt8195: Fix error handling in mt8195_mt6359_rt1019_rt5682_dev_probe

The device_node pointer is returned by of_parse_phandle()  with refcount
incremented. We should use of_node_put() on it when done.

This function only calls of_node_put() in the regular path.
And it will cause refcount leak in error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49240 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c652f8f0875b569f8afa80b8cf9762828fd6187b
