Subject: CVE-2022-48655: firmware: arm_scmi: Harden accesses to the reset domains

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: arm_scmi: Harden accesses to the reset domains

Accessing reset domains descriptors by the index upon the SCMI drivers
requests through the SCMI reset operations interface can potentially
lead to out-of-bound violations if the SCMI driver misbehave.

Add an internal consistency check before any such domains descriptors
accesses.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48655 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
