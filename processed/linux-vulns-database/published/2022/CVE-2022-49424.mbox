Subject: CVE-2022-49424: iommu/mediatek: Fix NULL pointer dereference when printing dev_name

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/mediatek: Fix NULL pointer dereference when printing dev_name

When larbdev is NULL (in the case I hit, the node is incorrectly set
iommus = <&iommu NUM>), it will cause device_link_add() fail and
kernel crashes when we try to print dev_name(larbdev).

Let's fail the probe if a larbdev is NULL to avoid invalid inputs from
dts.

It should work for normal correct setting and avoid the crash caused
by my incorrect setting.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
