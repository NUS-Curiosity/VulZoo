Subject: CVE-2022-48785: ipv6: mcast: use rcu-safe version of ipv6_get_lladdr()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: mcast: use rcu-safe version of ipv6_get_lladdr()

Some time ago 8965779d2c0e ("ipv6,mcast: always hold idev->lock before mca_lock")
switched ipv6_get_lladdr() to __ipv6_get_lladdr(), which is rcu-unsafe
version. That was OK, because idev->lock was held for these codepaths.

In 88e2ca308094 ("mld: convert ifmcaddr6 to RCU") these external locks were
removed, so we probably need to restore the original rcu-safe call.

Otherwise, we occasionally get a machine crashed/stalled with the following
in dmesg:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
