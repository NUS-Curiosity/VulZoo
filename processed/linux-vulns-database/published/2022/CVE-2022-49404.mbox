Subject: CVE-2022-49404: RDMA/hfi1: Fix potential integer multiplication overflow errors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/hfi1: Fix potential integer multiplication overflow errors

When multiplying of different types, an overflow is possible even when
storing the result in a larger type. This is because the conversion is
done after the multiplication. So arithmetic overflow and thus in
incorrect value is possible.

Correct an instance of this in the inter packet delay calculation.  Fix by
ensuring one of the operands is u64 which will promote the other to u64 as
well ensuring no overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49404 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
