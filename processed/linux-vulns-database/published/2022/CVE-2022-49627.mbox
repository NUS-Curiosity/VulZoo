Subject: CVE-2022-49627: ima: Fix potential memory leak in ima_init_crypto()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ima: Fix potential memory leak in ima_init_crypto()

On failure to allocate the SHA1 tfm, IMA fails to initialize and exits
without freeing the ima_algo_array. Add the missing kfree() for
ima_algo_array to avoid the potential memory leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49627 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
