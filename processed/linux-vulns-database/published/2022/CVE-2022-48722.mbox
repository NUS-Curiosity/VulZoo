Subject: CVE-2022-48722: net: ieee802154: ca8210: Stop leaking skb's

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ieee802154: ca8210: Stop leaking skb's

Upon error the ieee802154_xmit_complete() helper is not called. Only
ieee802154_wake_queue() is called manually. We then leak the skb
structure.

Free the skb structure upon error before returning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48722 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
