Subject: CVE-2022-49522: mmc: jz4740: Apply DMA engine limits to maximum segment size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: jz4740: Apply DMA engine limits to maximum segment size

Do what is done in other DMA-enabled MMC host drivers (cf. host/mmci.c) and
limit the maximum segment size based on the DMA engine's capabilities. This
is needed to avoid warnings like the following with CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG=y.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
