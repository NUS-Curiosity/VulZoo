Subject: CVE-2022-49634: sysctl: Fix data-races in proc_dou8vec_minmax().

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sysctl: Fix data-races in proc_dou8vec_minmax().

A sysctl variable is accessed concurrently, and there is always a chance
of data-race.  So, all readers and writers need some basic protection to
avoid load/store-tearing.

This patch changes proc_dou8vec_minmax() to use READ_ONCE() and
WRITE_ONCE() internally to fix data-races on the sysctl side.  For now,
proc_dou8vec_minmax() itself is tolerant to a data-race, but we still
need to add annotations on the other subsystem's side.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49634 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
