Subject: CVE-2022-49329: vduse: Fix NULL pointer dereference on sysfs access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vduse: Fix NULL pointer dereference on sysfs access

The control device has no drvdata. So we will get a
NULL pointer dereference when accessing control
device's msg_timeout attribute via sysfs:

[ 132.841881][ T3644] BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000f8

To fix it, don't create the unneeded attribute for
control device anymore.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49329 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
