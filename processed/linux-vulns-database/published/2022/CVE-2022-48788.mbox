Subject: CVE-2022-48788: nvme-rdma: fix possible use-after-free in transport error_recovery work

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-rdma: fix possible use-after-free in transport error_recovery work

While nvme_rdma_submit_async_event_work is checking the ctrl and queue
state before preparing the AER command and scheduling io_work, in order
to fully prevent a race where this check is not reliable the error
recovery work must flush async_event_work before continuing to destroy
the admin queue after setting the ctrl state to RESETTING such that
there is no race .submit_async_event and the error recovery handler
itself changing the ctrl state.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48788 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
