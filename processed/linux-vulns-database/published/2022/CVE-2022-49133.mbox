Subject: CVE-2022-49133: drm/amdkfd: svm range restore work deadlock when process exit

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: svm range restore work deadlock when process exit

kfd_process_notifier_release flush svm_range_restore_work
which calls svm_range_list_lock_and_flush_work to flush deferred_list
work, but if deferred_list work mmput release the last user, it will
call exit_mmap -> notifier_release, it is deadlock with below backtrace.

Move flush svm_range_restore_work to kfd_process_wq_release to avoid
deadlock. Then svm_range_restore_work take task->mm ref to avoid mm is
gone while validating and mapping ranges to GPU.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
