Subject: CVE-2022-49692: net: phy: at803x: fix NULL pointer dereference on AR9331 PHY

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: at803x: fix NULL pointer dereference on AR9331 PHY

Latest kernel will explode on the PHY interrupt config, since it depends
now on allocated priv. So, run probe to allocate priv to fix it.

 ar9331_switch ethernet.1:10 lan0 (uninitialized): PHY [!ahb!ethernet@1a000000!mdio!switch@10:00] driver [Qualcomm Atheros AR9331 built-in PHY] (irq=13)
 CPU 0 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000000a, epc == 8050e8a8, ra == 80504b34

Same Issue would affect some other PHYs (QCA8081, QCA9561), so fix it
too.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49692 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/66fa352215e8455ba2e5f33793535795bd3e36ca
