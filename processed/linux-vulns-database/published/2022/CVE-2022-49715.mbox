Subject: CVE-2022-49715: irqchip/gic-v3: Fix refcount leak in gic_populate_ppi_partitions

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

irqchip/gic-v3: Fix refcount leak in gic_populate_ppi_partitions

of_find_node_by_phandle() returns a node pointer with refcount
incremented, we should use of_node_put() on it when not need anymore.
Add missing of_node_put() to avoid refcount leak.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49715 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
