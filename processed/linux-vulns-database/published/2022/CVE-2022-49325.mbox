Subject: CVE-2022-49325: tcp: add accessors to read/set tp->snd_cwnd

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: add accessors to read/set tp->snd_cwnd

We had various bugs over the years with code
breaking the assumption that tp->snd_cwnd is greater
than zero.

Lately, syzbot reported the WARN_ON_ONCE(!tp->prior_cwnd) added
in commit 8b8a321ff72c ("tcp: fix zero cwnd in tcp_cwnd_reduction")
can trigger, and without a repro we would have to spend
considerable time finding the bug.

Instead of complaining too late, we want to catch where
and when tp->snd_cwnd is set to an illegal value.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49325 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
