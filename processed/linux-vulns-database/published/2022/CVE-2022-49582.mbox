Subject: CVE-2022-49582: net: dsa: fix NULL pointer dereference in dsa_port_reset_vlan_filtering

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: fix NULL pointer dereference in dsa_port_reset_vlan_filtering

The "ds" iterator variable used in dsa_port_reset_vlan_filtering() ->
dsa_switch_for_each_port() overwrites the "dp" received as argument,
which is later used to call dsa_port_vlan_filtering() proper.

As a result, switches which do enter that code path (the ones with
vlan_filtering_is_global=true) will dereference an invalid dp in
dsa_port_reset_vlan_filtering() after leaving a VLAN-aware bridge.

Use a dedicated "other_dp" iterator variable to avoid this from
happening.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49582 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3240e12fe203a3a79b9814e83327106b770ed7b0
