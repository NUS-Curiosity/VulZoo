Subject: CVE-2022-48854: net: arc_emac: Fix use after free in arc_mdio_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: arc_emac: Fix use after free in arc_mdio_probe()

If bus->state is equal to MDIOBUS_ALLOCATED, mdiobus_free(bus) will free
the "bus". But bus->name is still used in the next line, which will lead
to a use after free.

We can fix it by putting the name in a local variable and make the
bus->name point to the rodata section "name",then use the name in the
error message without referring to bus to avoid the uaf.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48854 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
