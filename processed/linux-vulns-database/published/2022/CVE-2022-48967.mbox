Subject: CVE-2022-48967: NFC: nci: Bounds check struct nfc_target arrays

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFC: nci: Bounds check struct nfc_target arrays

While running under CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE=y, syzkaller reported:

  memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 129) of single field "target->sensf_res" at net/nfc/nci/ntf.c:260 (size 18)

This appears to be a legitimate lack of bounds checking in
nci_add_new_protocol(). Add the missing checks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48967 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
