Subject: CVE-2022-49468: thermal/core: Fix memory leak in __thermal_cooling_device_register()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal/core: Fix memory leak in __thermal_cooling_device_register()

I got memory leak as follows when doing fault injection test:

unreferenced object 0xffff888010080000 (size 264312):
  comm "182", pid 102533, jiffies 4296434960 (age 10.100s)
  hex dump (first 32 bytes):

If device_register() fails, thermal_cooling_device_destroy_sysfs() need be called
to free the memory allocated in thermal_cooling_device_setup_sysfs().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49468 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
