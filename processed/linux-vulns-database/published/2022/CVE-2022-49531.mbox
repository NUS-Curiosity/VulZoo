Subject: CVE-2022-49531: loop: implement ->free_disk

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

loop: implement ->free_disk

Ensure that the lo_device which is stored in the gendisk private
data is valid until the gendisk is freed.  Currently the loop driver
uses a lot of effort to make sure a device is not freed when it is
still in use, but to to fix a potential deadlock this will be relaxed
a bit soon.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49531 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 5.18.3 with commit aadd1443aae7fe8956e3b11157827067f034406a
	Fixed in 5.19 with commit d2c7f56f8b5256d57f9e3fc7794c31361d43bdd9

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
