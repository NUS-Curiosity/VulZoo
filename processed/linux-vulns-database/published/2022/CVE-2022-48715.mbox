Subject: CVE-2022-48715: scsi: bnx2fc: Make bnx2fc_recv_frame() mp safe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: bnx2fc: Make bnx2fc_recv_frame() mp safe

Running tests with a debug kernel shows that bnx2fc_recv_frame() is
modifying the per_cpu lport stats counters in a non-mpsafe way.  Just boot
a debug kernel and run the bnx2fc driver with the hardware enabled.

Restore the old get_cpu/put_cpu code with some modifications to reduce the
size of the critical section.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48715 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
