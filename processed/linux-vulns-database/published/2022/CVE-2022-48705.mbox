Subject: CVE-2022-48705: wifi: mt76: mt7921e: fix crash in chip reset fail

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7921e: fix crash in chip reset fail

In case of drv own fail in reset, we may need to run mac_reset several
times. The sequence would trigger system crash as the log below.

Because we do not re-enable/schedule "tx_napi" before disable it again,
the process would keep waiting for state change in napi_diable(). To
avoid the problem and keep status synchronize for each run, goto final
resource handling if drv own failed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f7f3001723e337568017e8617974f29bc8b2f595
