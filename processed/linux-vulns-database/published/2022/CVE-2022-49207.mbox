Subject: CVE-2022-49207: bpf, sockmap: Fix memleak in sk_psock_queue_msg

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Fix memleak in sk_psock_queue_msg

If tcp_bpf_sendmsg is running during a tear down operation we may enqueue
data on the ingress msg queue while tear down is trying to free it.

 sk1 (redirect sk2)                         sk2
 -------------------                      ---------------
tcp_bpf_sendmsg()
 tcp_bpf_send_verdict()
  tcp_bpf_sendmsg_redir()
   bpf_tcp_ingress()
                                          sock_map_close()
                                           lock_sock()
    lock_sock() ... blocking
                                           sk_psock_stop
                                            sk_psock_clear_state(psock, SK_PSOCK_TX_ENABLED);
                                           release_sock(sk);
    lock_sock()
    sk_mem_charge()
    get_page()
    sk_psock_queue_msg()
     sk_psock_test_state(psock, SK_PSOCK_TX_ENABLED);
      drop_sk_msg()
    release_sock()

While drop_sk_msg(), the msg has charged memory form sk by sk_mem_charge
and has sg pages need to put. To fix we use sk_msg_free() and then kfee()
msg.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
