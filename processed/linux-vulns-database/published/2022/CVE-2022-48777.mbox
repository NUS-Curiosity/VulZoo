Subject: CVE-2022-48777: mtd: parsers: qcom: Fix kernel panic on skipped partition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: parsers: qcom: Fix kernel panic on skipped partition

In the event of a skipped partition (case when the entry name is empty)
the kernel panics in the cleanup function as the name entry is NULL.
Rework the parser logic by first checking the real partition number and
then allocate the space and set the data for the valid partitions.

The logic was also fundamentally wrong as with a skipped partition, the
parts number returned was incorrect by not decreasing it for the skipped
partitions.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48777 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eb03cb6e03ffd9173e18e5fe87e4e3ce83820453
