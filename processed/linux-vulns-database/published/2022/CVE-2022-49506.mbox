Subject: CVE-2022-49506: drm/mediatek: Add vblank register/unregister callback functions

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Add vblank register/unregister callback functions

We encountered a kernel panic issue that callback data will be NULL when
it's using in ovl irq handler. There is a timing issue between
mtk_disp_ovl_irq_handler() and mtk_ovl_disable_vblank().

To resolve this issue, we use the flow to register/unregister vblank cb:
- Register callback function and callback data when crtc creates.
- Unregister callback function and callback data when crtc destroies.

With this solution, we can assure callback data will not be NULL when
vblank is disable.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49506 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
