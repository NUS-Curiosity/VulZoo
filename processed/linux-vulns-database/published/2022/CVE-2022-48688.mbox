Subject: CVE-2022-48688: i40e: Fix kernel crash during module removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: Fix kernel crash during module removal

The driver incorrectly frees client instance and subsequent
i40e module removal leads to kernel crash.

Reproducer:
1. Do ethtool offline test followed immediately by another one
host# ethtool -t eth0 offline; ethtool -t eth0 offline
2. Remove recursively irdma module that also removes i40e module
host# modprobe -r irdma

Result:

Two offline tests cause IRDMA driver failure (ETIMEDOUT) and this
failure is indicated back to i40e_client_subtask() that calls
i40e_client_del_instance() to free client instance referenced
by pf->cinst and sets this pointer to NULL. During the module
removal i40e_remove() calls i40e_lan_del_device() that dereferences
pf->cinst that is NULL -> crash.
Do not remove client instance when client open callbacks fails and
just clear __I40E_CLIENT_INSTANCE_OPENED bit. The driver also needs
to take care about this situation (when netdev is up and client
is NOT opened) in i40e_notify_client_of_netdev_close() and
calls client close callback only when __I40E_CLIENT_INSTANCE_OPENED
is set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48688 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
