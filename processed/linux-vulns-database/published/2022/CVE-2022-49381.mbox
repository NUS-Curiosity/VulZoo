Subject: CVE-2022-49381: jffs2: fix memory leak in jffs2_do_fill_super

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jffs2: fix memory leak in jffs2_do_fill_super

If jffs2_iget() or d_make_root() in jffs2_do_fill_super() returns
an error, we can observe the following kmemleak report:

--------------------------------------------

This is because the resources allocated in jffs2_sum_init() are not
released. Call jffs2_sum_exit() to release these resources to solve
the problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49381 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
