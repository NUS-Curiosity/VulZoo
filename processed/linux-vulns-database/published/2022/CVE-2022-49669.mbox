Subject: CVE-2022-49669: mptcp: fix race on unaccepted mptcp sockets

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix race on unaccepted mptcp sockets

When the listener socket owning the relevant request is closed,
it frees the unaccepted subflows and that causes later deletion
of the paired MPTCP sockets.

The mptcp socket's worker can run in the time interval between such delete
operations. When that happens, any access to msk->first will cause an UaF
access, as the subflow cleanup did not cleared such field in the mptcp
socket.

Address the issue explicitly traversing the listener socket accept
queue at close time and performing the needed cleanup on the pending
msk.

Note that the locking is a bit tricky, as we need to acquire the msk
socket lock, while still owning the subflow socket one.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49669 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/mptcp/protocol.c
	net/mptcp/protocol.h
	net/mptcp/subflow.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8a3e95c74e48c2c9b07b81fafda9122993f2e12
