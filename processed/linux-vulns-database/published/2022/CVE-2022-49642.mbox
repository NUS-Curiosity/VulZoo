Subject: CVE-2022-49642: net: stmmac: dwc-qos: Disable split header for Tegra194

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: dwc-qos: Disable split header for Tegra194

There is a long-standing issue with the Synopsys DWC Ethernet driver
for Tegra194 where random system crashes have been observed [0]. The
problem occurs when the split header feature is enabled in the stmmac
driver. In the bad case, a larger than expected buffer length is
received and causes the calculation of the total buffer length to
overflow. This results in a very large buffer length that causes the
kernel to crash. Why this larger buffer length is received is not clear,
however, the feedback from the NVIDIA design team is that the split
header feature is not supported for Tegra194. Therefore, disable split
header support for Tegra194 to prevent these random crashes from
occurring.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
