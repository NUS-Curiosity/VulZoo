Subject: CVE-2022-49281: cifs: fix handlecache and multiuser

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix handlecache and multiuser

In multiuser each individual user has their own tcon structure for the
share and thus their own handle for a cached directory.
When we umount such a share we much make sure to release the pinned down dentry
for each such tcon and not just the master tcon.

Otherwise we will get nasty warnings on umount that dentries are still in use:
[ 3459.590047] BUG: Dentry 00000000115c6f41{i=12000000019d95,n=/}  still in use\
 (2) [unmount of cifs cifs]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
