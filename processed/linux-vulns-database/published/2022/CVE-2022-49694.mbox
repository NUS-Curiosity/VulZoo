Subject: CVE-2022-49694: block: disable the elevator int del_gendisk

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: disable the elevator int del_gendisk

The elevator is only used for file system requests, which are stopped in
del_gendisk.  Move disabling the elevator and freeing the scheduler tags
to the end of del_gendisk instead of doing that work in disk_release and
blk_cleanup_queue to avoid a use after free on q->tag_set from
disk_release as the tag_set might not be alive at that point.

Move the blk_qos_exit call as well, as it just depends on the elevator
exit and would be the only reason to keep the not exactly cheap queue
freeze in disk_release.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49694 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
