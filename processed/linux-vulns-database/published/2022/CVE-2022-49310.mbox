Subject: CVE-2022-49310: char: xillybus: fix a refcount leak in cleanup_dev()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

char: xillybus: fix a refcount leak in cleanup_dev()

usb_get_dev is called in xillyusb_probe. So it is better to call
usb_put_dev before xdev is released.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49310 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
