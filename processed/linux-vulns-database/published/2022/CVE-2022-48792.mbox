Subject: CVE-2022-48792: scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_task

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm8001: Fix use-after-free for aborted SSP/STP sas_task

Currently a use-after-free may occur if a sas_task is aborted by the upper
layer before we handle the I/O completion in mpi_ssp_completion() or
mpi_sata_completion().

In this case, the following are the two steps in handling those I/O
completions:

 - Call complete() to inform the upper layer handler of completion of
   the I/O.

 - Release driver resources associated with the sas_task in
   pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.

When complete() is called, the upper layer may free the sas_task. As such,
we should not touch the associated sas_task afterwards, but we do so in the
pm8001_ccb_task_free() call.

Fix by swapping the complete() and pm8001_ccb_task_free() calls ordering.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48792 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
