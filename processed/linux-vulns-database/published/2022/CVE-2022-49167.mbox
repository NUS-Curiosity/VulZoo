Subject: CVE-2022-49167: btrfs: do not double complete bio on errors during compressed reads

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: do not double complete bio on errors during compressed reads

I hit some weird panics while fixing up the error handling from
btrfs_lookup_bio_sums().  Turns out the compression path will complete
the bio we use if we set up any of the compression bios and then return
an error, and then btrfs_submit_data_bio() will also call bio_endio() on
the bio.

Fix this by making btrfs_submit_compressed_read() responsible for
calling bio_endio() on the bio if there are any errors.  Currently it
was only doing it if we created the compression bios, otherwise it was
depending on btrfs_submit_data_bio() to do the right thing.  This
creates the above problem, so fix up btrfs_submit_compressed_read() to
always call bio_endio() in case of an error, and then simply return from
btrfs_submit_data_bio() if we had to call
btrfs_submit_compressed_read().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49167 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/btrfs/compression.c

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4a4ceb2b990771c374d85d496a1a45255dde48e3
