Subject: CVE-2022-49703: scsi: ibmvfc: Store vhost pointer during subcrq allocation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ibmvfc: Store vhost pointer during subcrq allocation

Currently the back pointer from a queue to the vhost adapter isn't set
until after subcrq interrupt registration. The value is available when a
queue is first allocated and can/should be also set for primary and async
queues as well as subcrqs.

This fixes a crash observed during kexec/kdump on Power 9 with legacy XICS
interrupt controller where a pending subcrq interrupt from the previous
kernel can be replayed immediately upon IRQ registration resulting in
dereference of a garbage backpointer in ibmvfc_interrupt_scsi().

Kernel attempted to read user page (58) - exploit attempt? (uid: 0)
BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read at 0x00000058
Faulting instruction address: 0xc008000003216a08
Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
