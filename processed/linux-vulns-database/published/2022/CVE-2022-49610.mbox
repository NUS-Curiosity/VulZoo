Subject: CVE-2022-49610: KVM: VMX: Prevent RSB underflow before vmenter

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: VMX: Prevent RSB underflow before vmenter

On VMX, there are some balanced returns between the time the guest's
SPEC_CTRL value is written, and the vmenter.

Balanced returns (matched by a preceding call) are usually ok, but it's
at least theoretically possible an NMI with a deep call stack could
empty the RSB before one of the returns.

For maximum paranoia, don't allow *any* returns (balanced or otherwise)
between the SPEC_CTRL write and the vmenter.

  [ bp: Fix 32-bit build. ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49610 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
