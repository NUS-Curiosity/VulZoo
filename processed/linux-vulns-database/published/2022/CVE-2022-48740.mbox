Subject: CVE-2022-48740: selinux: fix double free of cond_list on error paths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

selinux: fix double free of cond_list on error paths

On error path from cond_read_list() and duplicate_policydb_cond_list()
the cond_list_destroy() gets called a second time in caller functions,
resulting in NULL pointer deref.  Fix this by resetting the
cond_list_len to 0 in cond_list_destroy(), making subsequent calls a
noop.

Also consistently reset the cond_list pointer to NULL after freeing.

[PM: fix line lengths in the description]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48740 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
