Subject: CVE-2022-49472: net: phy: micrel: Allow probing without .driver_data

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: micrel: Allow probing without .driver_data

Currently, if the .probe element is present in the phy_driver structure
and the .driver_data is not, a NULL pointer dereference happens.

Allow passing .probe without .driver_data by inserting NULL checks
for priv->type.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49472 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
