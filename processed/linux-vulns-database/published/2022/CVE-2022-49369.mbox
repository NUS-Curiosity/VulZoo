Subject: CVE-2022-49369: amt: fix possible memory leak in amt_rcv()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

amt: fix possible memory leak in amt_rcv()

If an amt receives packets and it finds socket.
If it can't find a socket, it should free a received skb.
But it doesn't.
So, a memory leak would possibly occur.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49369 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
