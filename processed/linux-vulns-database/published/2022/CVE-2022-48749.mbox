Subject: CVE-2022-48749: drm/msm/dpu: invalid parameter check in dpu_setup_dspp_pcc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: invalid parameter check in dpu_setup_dspp_pcc

The function performs a check on the "ctx" input parameter, however, it
is used before the check.

Initialize the "base" variable after the sanity check to avoid a
possible NULL pointer dereference.

Addresses-Coverity-ID: 1493866 ("Null pointer dereference")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48749 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
