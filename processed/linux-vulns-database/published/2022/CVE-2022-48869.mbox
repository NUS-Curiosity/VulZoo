Subject: CVE-2022-48869: USB: gadgetfs: Fix race between mounting and unmounting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: gadgetfs: Fix race between mounting and unmounting

The syzbot fuzzer and Gerald Lee have identified a use-after-free bug
in the gadgetfs driver, involving processes concurrently mounting and
unmounting the gadgetfs filesystem.  In particular, gadgetfs_fill_super()
can race with gadgetfs_kill_sb(), causing the latter to deallocate
the_device while the former is using it.  The output from KASAN says,
in part:

BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in instrument_atomic_read_write include/linux/instrumented.h:102 [inline]

The simplest solution is to ensure that gadgetfs_fill_super() and
gadgetfs_kill_sb() are serialized by making them both acquire a new
mutex.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48869 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
