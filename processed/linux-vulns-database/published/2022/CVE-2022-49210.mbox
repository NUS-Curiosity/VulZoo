Subject: CVE-2022-49210: MIPS: pgalloc: fix memory leak caused by pgd_free()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

MIPS: pgalloc: fix memory leak caused by pgd_free()

pgd page is freed by generic implementation pgd_free() since commit
f9cb654cb550 ("asm-generic: pgalloc: provide generic pgd_free()"),
however, there are scenarios that the system uses more than one page as
the pgd table, in such cases the generic implementation pgd_free() won't
be applicable anymore. For example, when PAGE_SIZE_4KB is enabled and
MIPS_VA_BITS_48 is not enabled in a 64bit system, the macro "PGD_ORDER"
will be set as "1", which will cause allocating two pages as the pgd
table. Well, at the same time, the generic implementation pgd_free()
just free one pgd page, which will result in the memory leak.

The memory leak can be easily detected by executing shell command:
"while true; do ls > /dev/null; grep MemFree /proc/meminfo; done"

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49210 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
