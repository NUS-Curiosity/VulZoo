Subject: CVE-2022-48926: usb: gadget: rndis: add spinlock for rndis response list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: rndis: add spinlock for rndis response list

There's no lock for rndis response list. It could cause list corruption
if there're two different list_add at the same time like below.
It's better to add in rndis_add_response / rndis_free_response
/ rndis_get_next_response to prevent any race condition on response list.

[  361.894299] [1:   irq/191-dwc3:16979] list_add corruption.
next->prev should be prev (ffffff80651764d0),
but was ffffff883dc36f80. (next=ffffff80651764d0).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
