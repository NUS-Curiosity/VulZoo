Subject: CVE-2022-48927: iio: adc: tsc2046: fix memory corruption by preventing array overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: tsc2046: fix memory corruption by preventing array overflow

On one side we have indio_dev->num_channels includes all physical channels +
timestamp channel. On other side we have an array allocated only for
physical channels. So, fix memory corruption by ARRAY_SIZE() instead of
num_channels variable.

Note the first case is a cleanup rather than a fix as the software
timestamp channel bit in active_scanmask is never set by the IIO core.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48927 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
