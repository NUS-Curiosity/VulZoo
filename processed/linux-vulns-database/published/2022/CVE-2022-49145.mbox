Subject: CVE-2022-49145: ACPI: CPPC: Avoid out of bounds access when parsing _CPC data

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: CPPC: Avoid out of bounds access when parsing _CPC data

If the NumEntries field in the _CPC return package is less than 2, do
not attempt to access the "Revision" element of that package, because
it may not be present then.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
