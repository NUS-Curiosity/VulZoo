Subject: CVE-2022-49707: ext4: add reserved GDT blocks check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: add reserved GDT blocks check

We capture a NULL pointer issue when resizing a corrupt ext4 image which
is freshly clear resize_inode feature (not run e2fsck). It could be
simply reproduced by following steps. The problem is because of the
resize_inode feature was cleared, and it will convert the filesystem to
meta_bg mode in ext4_resize_fs(), but the es->s_reserved_gdt_blocks was
not reduced to zero, so could we mistakenly call reserve_backup_gdb()
and passing an uninitialized resize_inode to it when adding new group
descriptors.

 mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda 3G
 tune2fs -O ^resize_inode /dev/sda #forget to run requested e2fsck
 mount /dev/sda /mnt
 resize2fs /dev/sda 8G

The fix is simple, add a check in ext4_resize_begin() to make sure that
the es->s_reserved_gdt_blocks is zero when the resize_inode feature is
disabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49707 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
