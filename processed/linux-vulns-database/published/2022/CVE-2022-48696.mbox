Subject: CVE-2022-48696: regmap: spi: Reserve space for register address/padding

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regmap: spi: Reserve space for register address/padding

Currently the max_raw_read and max_raw_write limits in regmap_spi struct
do not take into account the additional size of the transmitted register
address and padding.  This may result in exceeding the maximum permitted
SPI message size, which could cause undefined behaviour, e.g. data
corruption.

Fix regmap_get_spi_bus() to properly adjust the above mentioned limits
by reserving space for the register address/padding as set in the regmap
configuration.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48696 to this issue.

	Issue introduced in 5.16 with commit f231ff38b7b2 and fixed in 5.19.9 with commit 15ff1f17847c

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/base/regmap/regmap-spi.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
