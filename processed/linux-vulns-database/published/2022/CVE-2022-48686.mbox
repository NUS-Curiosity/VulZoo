Subject: CVE-2022-48686: nvme-tcp: fix UAF when detecting digest errors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-tcp: fix UAF when detecting digest errors

We should also bail from the io_work loop when we set rd_enabled to true,
so we don't attempt to read data from the socket when the TCP stream is
already out-of-sync or corrupted.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48686 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
