Subject: CVE-2022-48770: bpf: Guard against accessing NULL pt_regs in bpf_get_task_stack()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Guard against accessing NULL pt_regs in bpf_get_task_stack()

task_pt_regs() can return NULL on powerpc for kernel threads. This is
then used in __bpf_get_stack() to check for user mode, resulting in a
kernel oops. Guard against this by checking return value of
task_pt_regs() before trying to obtain the call chain.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48770 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
