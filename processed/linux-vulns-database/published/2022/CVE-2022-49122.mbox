Subject: CVE-2022-49122: dm ioctl: prevent potential spectre v1 gadget

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm ioctl: prevent potential spectre v1 gadget

It appears like cmd could be a Spectre v1 gadget as it's supplied by a
user and used as an array index. Prevent the contents of kernel memory
from being leaked to userspace via speculative execution by using
array_index_nospec.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49122 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
