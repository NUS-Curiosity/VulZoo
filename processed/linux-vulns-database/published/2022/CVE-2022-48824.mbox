Subject: CVE-2022-48824: scsi: myrs: Fix crash in error case

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: myrs: Fix crash in error case

In myrs_detect(), cs->disable_intr is NULL when privdata->hw_init() fails
with non-zero. In this case, myrs_cleanup(cs) will call a NULL ptr and
crash the kernel.

[    1.105606] myrs 0000:00:03.0: Unknown Initialization Error 5A
[    1.105872] myrs 0000:00:03.0: Failed to initialize Controller

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
