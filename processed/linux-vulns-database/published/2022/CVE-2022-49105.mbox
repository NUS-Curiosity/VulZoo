Subject: CVE-2022-49105: staging: wfx: fix an error handling in wfx_init_common()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: wfx: fix an error handling in wfx_init_common()

One error handler of wfx_init_common() return without calling
ieee80211_free_hw(hw), which may result in memory leak. And I add
one err label to unify the error handler, which is useful for the
subsequent changes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49105 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
