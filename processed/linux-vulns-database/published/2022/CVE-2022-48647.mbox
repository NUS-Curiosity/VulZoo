Subject: CVE-2022-48647: sfc: fix TX channel offset when using legacy interrupts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sfc: fix TX channel offset when using legacy interrupts

In legacy interrupt mode the tx_channel_offset was hardcoded to 1, but
that's not correct if efx_sepparate_tx_channels is false. In that case,
the offset is 0 because the tx queues are in the single existing channel
at index 0, together with the rx queue.

Without this fix, as soon as you try to send any traffic, it tries to
get the tx queues from an uninitialized channel getting these errors:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
