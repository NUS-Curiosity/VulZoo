Subject: CVE-2022-49411: bfq: Make sure bfqg for which we are queueing requests is online

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bfq: Make sure bfqg for which we are queueing requests is online

Bios queued into BFQ IO scheduler can be associated with a cgroup that
was already offlined. This may then cause insertion of this bfq_group
into a service tree. But this bfq_group will get freed as soon as last
bio associated with it is completed leading to use after free issues for
service tree users. Fix the problem by making sure we always operate on
online bfq_group. If the bfq_group associated with the bio is not
online, we pick the first online parent.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49411 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
