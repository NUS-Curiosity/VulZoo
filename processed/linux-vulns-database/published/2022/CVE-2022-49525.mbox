Subject: CVE-2022-49525: media: cx25821: Fix the warning when removing the module

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: cx25821: Fix the warning when removing the module

When removing the module, we will get the following warning:

[   14.746697] remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'irq/21', leaking at least 'cx25821[1]'
[   14.747449] WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 368 at fs/proc/generic.c:717 remove_proc_entry+0x389/0x3f0

Fix this by freeing the irq before call pci_disable_device().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
