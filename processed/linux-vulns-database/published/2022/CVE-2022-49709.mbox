Subject: CVE-2022-49709: cfi: Fix __cfi_slowpath_diag RCU usage with cpuidle

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cfi: Fix __cfi_slowpath_diag RCU usage with cpuidle

RCU_NONIDLE usage during __cfi_slowpath_diag can result in an invalid
RCU state in the cpuidle code path:

  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 0 at kernel/rcu/tree.c:613 rcu_eqs_enter+0xe4/0x138
  ...
  Call trace:
    rcu_eqs_enter+0xe4/0x138
    rcu_idle_enter+0xa8/0x100
    cpuidle_enter_state+0x154/0x3a8
    cpuidle_enter+0x3c/0x58
    do_idle.llvm.6590768638138871020+0x1f4/0x2ec
    cpu_startup_entry+0x28/0x2c
    secondary_start_kernel+0x1b8/0x220
    __secondary_switched+0x94/0x98

Instead, call rcu_irq_enter/exit to wake up RCU only when needed and
disable interrupts for the entire CFI shadow/module check when we do.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49709 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
