 __device_suspend+0x108/0x3c0

The basic flow:
	1. run time suspend call xhci_suspend, xhci parent devices gate the clock.
        2. echo mem >/sys/power/state, system _device_suspend call xhci_suspend
        3. xhci_suspend call xhci_disable_hub_port_wake, which access register,
	   but clock already gated by run time suspend.

This problem was hidden by power domain driver, which call run time resume before it.

But the below commit remove it and make this issue happen.
	commit c1df456d0f06e ("PM: domains: Don't runtime resume devices at genpd_prepare()")

This patch call run time resume before suspend to make sure clock is on
before access register.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
