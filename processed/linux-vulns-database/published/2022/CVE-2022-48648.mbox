Subject: CVE-2022-48648: sfc: fix null pointer dereference in efx_hard_start_xmit

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sfc: fix null pointer dereference in efx_hard_start_xmit

Trying to get the channel from the tx_queue variable here is wrong
because we can only be here if tx_queue is NULL, so we shouldn't
dereference it. As the above comment in the code says, this is very
unlikely to happen, but it's wrong anyway so let's fix it.

I hit this issue because of a different bug that caused tx_queue to be
NULL. If that happens, this is the error message that we get here:
  BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020
  [...]
  RIP: 0010:efx_hard_start_xmit+0x153/0x170 [sfc]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48648 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
