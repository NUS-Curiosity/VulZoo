Subject: CVE-2022-49077: mmmremap.c: avoid pointless invalidate_range_start/end on mremap(old_size=0)

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmmremap.c: avoid pointless invalidate_range_start/end on mremap(old_size=0)

If an mremap() syscall with old_size=0 ends up in move_page_tables(), it
will call invalidate_range_start()/invalidate_range_end() unnecessarily,
i.e.  with an empty range.

This causes a WARN in KVM's mmu_notifier.  In the past, empty ranges
have been diagnosed to be off-by-one bugs, hence the WARNing.  Given the
low (so far) number of unique reports, the benefits of detecting more
buggy callers seem to outweigh the cost of having to fix cases such as
this one, where userspace is doing something silly.  In this particular
case, an early return from move_page_tables() is enough to fix the
issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49077 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
