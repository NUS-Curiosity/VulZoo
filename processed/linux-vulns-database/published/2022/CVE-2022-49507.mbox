Subject: CVE-2022-49507: regulator: da9121: Fix uninit-value in da9121_assign_chip_model()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regulator: da9121: Fix uninit-value in da9121_assign_chip_model()

KASAN report slab-out-of-bounds in __regmap_init as follows:

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in __regmap_init drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c:841
Read of size 1 at addr ffff88803678cdf1 by task xrun/9137

CPU: 0 PID: 9137 Comm: xrun Tainted: G        W         5.18.0-rc2
Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.13.0-1ubuntu1.1 04/01/2014

This happend when da9121 device is probe by da9121_i2c_id, but with
invalid dts. Thus, chip->subvariant_id is set to -EINVAL, and later
da9121_assign_chip_model() will access 'regmap' without init it.

Fix it by return -EINVAL from da9121_assign_chip_model() if
'chip->subvariant_id' is invalid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49507 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
