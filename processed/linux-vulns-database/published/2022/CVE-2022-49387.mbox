Subject: CVE-2022-49387: watchdog: rzg2l_wdt: Fix 32bit overflow issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

watchdog: rzg2l_wdt: Fix 32bit overflow issue

The value of timer_cycle_us can be 0 due to 32bit overflow.
For eg:- If we assign the counter value "0xfff" for computing
maxval.

This patch fixes this issue by appending ULL to 1024, so that
it is promoted to 64bit.

This patch also fixes the warning message, 'watchdog: Invalid min and
max timeout values, resetting to 0!'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49387 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
