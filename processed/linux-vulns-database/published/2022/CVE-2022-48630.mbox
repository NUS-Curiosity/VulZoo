Subject: CVE-2022-48630: crypto: qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of WORD_SZ

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of WORD_SZ

The commit referenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break' from the else
branch in qcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop whenever 'max' is
not a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running:

    kcapi-rng -b 67 >/dev/null

There are many ways to fix this without adding back the 'break', but
they all seem more awkward than simply adding it back, so do just that.

Tested on a machine with Qualcomm Amberwing processor.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48630 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
