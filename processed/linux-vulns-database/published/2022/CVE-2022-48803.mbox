Subject: CVE-2022-48803: phy: ti: Fix missing sentinel for clk_div_table

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: ti: Fix missing sentinel for clk_div_table

_get_table_maxdiv() tries to access "clk_div_table" array out of bound
defined in phy-j721e-wiz.c. Add a sentinel entry to prevent
the following global-out-of-bounds error reported by enabling KASAN.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
