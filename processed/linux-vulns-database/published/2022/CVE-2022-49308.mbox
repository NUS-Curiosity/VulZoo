Subject: CVE-2022-49308: extcon: Modify extcon device to be created after driver data is set

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

extcon: Modify extcon device to be created after driver data is set

Currently, someone can invoke the sysfs such as state_show()
intermittently before dev_set_drvdata() is done.
And it can be a cause of kernel Oops because of edev is Null at that time.
So modified the driver registration to after setting drviver data.

- Oops's backtrace.

Backtrace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
