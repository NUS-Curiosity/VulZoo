Subject: CVE-2022-49606: RDMA/irdma: Fix sleep from invalid context BUG

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/irdma: Fix sleep from invalid context BUG

Taking the qos_mutex to process RoCEv2 QP's on netdev events causes a
kernel splat.

Fix this by removing the handling for RoCEv2 in
irdma_cm_teardown_connections that uses the mutex. This handling is only
needed for iWARP to avoid having connections established while the link is
down or having connections remain functional after the IP address is
removed.

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/mutex.
  Call Trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a4c5115140ed1833197bad9a6b80265840ff427f
