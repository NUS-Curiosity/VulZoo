Subject: CVE-2022-48640: bonding: fix NULL deref in bond_rr_gen_slave_id

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bonding: fix NULL deref in bond_rr_gen_slave_id

Fix a NULL dereference of the struct bonding.rr_tx_counter member because
if a bond is initially created with an initial mode != zero (Round Robin)
the memory required for the counter is never created and when the mode is
changed there is never any attempt to verify the memory is allocated upon
switching modes.

This causes the following Oops on an aarch64 machine:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
