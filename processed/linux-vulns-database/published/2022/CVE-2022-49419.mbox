Subject: CVE-2022-49419: video: fbdev: vesafb: Fix a use-after-free due early fb_info cleanup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

video: fbdev: vesafb: Fix a use-after-free due early fb_info cleanup

Commit b3c9a924aab6 ("fbdev: vesafb: Cleanup fb_info in .fb_destroy rather
than .remove") fixed a use-after-free error due the vesafb driver freeing
the fb_info in the .remove handler instead of doing it in .fb_destroy.

This can happen if the .fb_destroy callback is executed after the .remove
callback, since the former tries to access a pointer freed by the latter.

But that change didn't take into account that another possible scenario is
that .fb_destroy is called before the .remove callback. For example, if no
process has the fbdev chardev opened by the time the driver is removed.

If that's the case, fb_info will be freed when unregister_framebuffer() is
called, making the fb_info pointer accessed in vesafb_remove() after that
to no longer be valid.

To prevent that, move the expression containing the info->par to happen
before the unregister_framebuffer() function call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49419 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
