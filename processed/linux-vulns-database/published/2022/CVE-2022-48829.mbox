Subject: CVE-2022-48829: NFSD: Fix NFSv3 SETATTR/CREATE's handling of large file sizes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Fix NFSv3 SETATTR/CREATE's handling of large file sizes

iattr::ia_size is a loff_t, so these NFSv3 procedures must be
careful to deal with incoming client size values that are larger
than s64_max without corrupting the value.

Silently capping the value results in storing a different value
than the client passed in which is unexpected behavior, so remove
the min_t() check in decode_sattr3().

Note that RFC 1813 permits only the WRITE procedure to return
NFS3ERR_FBIG. We believe that NFSv3 reference implementations
also return NFS3ERR_FBIG when ia_size is too large.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48829 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
