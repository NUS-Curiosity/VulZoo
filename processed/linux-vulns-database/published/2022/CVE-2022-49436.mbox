Subject: CVE-2022-49436: powerpc/papr_scm: Fix leaking nvdimm_events_map elements

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/papr_scm: Fix leaking nvdimm_events_map elements

Right now 'char *' elements allocated for individual 'stat_id' in
'papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map[]' during papr_scm_pmu_check_events(), get
leaked in papr_scm_remove() and papr_scm_pmu_register(),
papr_scm_pmu_check_events() error paths.

Also individual 'stat_id' arent NULL terminated 'char *' instead they are fixed
8-byte sized identifiers. However papr_scm_pmu_register() assumes it to be a
NULL terminated 'char *' and at other places it assumes it to be a
'papr_scm_perf_stat.stat_id' sized string which is 8-byes in size.

Fix this by allocating the memory for papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map to also
include space for 'stat_id' entries. This is possible since number of available
events/stat_ids are known upfront. This saves some memory and one extra level of
indirection from 'nvdimm_events_map' to 'stat_id'. Also rest of the code
can continue to call 'kfree(papr_scm_priv.nvdimm_events_map)' without needing to
iterate over the array and free up individual elements.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49436 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b073096df4dec70d0436321b7093bad27ae91f9e
