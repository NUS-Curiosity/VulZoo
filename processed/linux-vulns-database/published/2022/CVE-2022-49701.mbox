Subject: CVE-2022-49701: scsi: ibmvfc: Allocate/free queue resource only during probe/remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ibmvfc: Allocate/free queue resource only during probe/remove

Currently, the sub-queues and event pool resources are allocated/freed for
every CRQ connection event such as reset and LPM. This exposes the driver
to a couple issues. First the inefficiency of freeing and reallocating
memory that can simply be resued after being sanitized. Further, a system
under memory pressue runs the risk of allocation failures that could result
in a crippled driver. Finally, there is a race window where command
submission/compeletion can try to pull/return elements from/to an event
pool that is being deleted or already has been deleted due to the lack of
host state around freeing/allocating resources. The following is an example
of list corruption following a live partition migration (LPM):

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
