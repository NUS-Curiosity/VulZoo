Subject: CVE-2022-48768: tracing/histogram: Fix a potential memory leak for kstrdup()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/histogram: Fix a potential memory leak for kstrdup()

kfree() is missing on an error path to free the memory allocated by
kstrdup():

  p = param = kstrdup(data->params[i], GFP_KERNEL);

So it is better to free it via kfree(p).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48768 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
