Subject: CVE-2022-49561: netfilter: conntrack: re-fetch conntrack after insertion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: conntrack: re-fetch conntrack after insertion

In case the conntrack is clashing, insertion can free skb->_nfct and
set skb->_nfct to the already-confirmed entry.

This wasn't found before because the conntrack entry and the extension
space used to free'd after an rcu grace period, plus the race needs
events enabled to trigger.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49561 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
