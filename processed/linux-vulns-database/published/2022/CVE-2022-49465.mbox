Subject: CVE-2022-49465: blk-throttle: Set BIO_THROTTLED when bio has been throttled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-throttle: Set BIO_THROTTLED when bio has been throttled

1.In current process, all bio will set the BIO_THROTTLED flag
after __blk_throtl_bio().

2.If bio needs to be throttled, it will start the timer and
stop submit bio directly. Bio will submit in
blk_throtl_dispatch_work_fn() when the timer expires.But in
the current process, if bio is throttled. The BIO_THROTTLED
will be set to bio after timer start. If the bio has been
completed, it may cause use-after-free blow.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
