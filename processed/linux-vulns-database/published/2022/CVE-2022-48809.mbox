Subject: CVE-2022-48809: net: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix a memleak when uncloning an skb dst and its metadata

When uncloning an skb dst and its associated metadata, a new
dst+metadata is allocated and later replaces the old one in the skb.
This is helpful to have a non-shared dst+metadata attached to a specific
skb.

The issue is the uncloned dst+metadata is initialized with a refcount of
1, which is increased to 2 before attaching it to the skb. When
tun_dst_unclone returns, the dst+metadata is only referenced from a
single place (the skb) while its refcount is 2. Its refcount will never
drop to 0 (when the skb is consumed), leading to a memory leak.

Fix this by removing the call to dst_hold in tun_dst_unclone, as the
dst+metadata refcount is already 1.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48809 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
