Subject: CVE-2022-48771: drm/vmwgfx: Fix stale file descriptors on failed usercopy

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Fix stale file descriptors on failed usercopy

A failing usercopy of the fence_rep object will lead to a stale entry in
the file descriptor table as put_unused_fd() won't release it. This
enables userland to refer to a dangling 'file' object through that still
valid file descriptor, leading to all kinds of use-after-free
exploitation scenarios.

Fix this by deferring the call to fd_install() until after the usercopy
has succeeded.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48771 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
