Subject: CVE-2022-49288: ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prealloc proc writes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: pcm: Fix races among concurrent prealloc proc writes

We have no protection against concurrent PCM buffer preallocation
changes via proc files, and it may potentially lead to UAF or some
weird problem.  This patch applies the PCM open_mutex to the proc
write operation for avoiding the racy proc writes and the PCM stream
open (and further operations).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49288 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
