Subject: CVE-2022-49196: powerpc/pseries: Fix use after free in remove_phb_dynamic()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pseries: Fix use after free in remove_phb_dynamic()

In remove_phb_dynamic() we use &phb->io_resource, after we've called
device_unregister(&host_bridge->dev). But the unregister may have freed
phb, because pcibios_free_controller_deferred() is the release function
for the host_bridge.

If there are no outstanding references when we call device_unregister()
then phb will be freed out from under us.

This has gone mainly unnoticed, but with slub_debug and page_poison
enabled it can lead to a crash:

To avoid it, we can take a reference to the host_bridge->dev until we're
done using phb. Then when we drop the reference the phb will be freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49196 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
