Subject: CVE-2022-49085: drbd: Fix five use after free bugs in get_initial_state

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drbd: Fix five use after free bugs in get_initial_state

In get_initial_state, it calls notify_initial_state_done(skb,..) if
cb->args[5]==1. If genlmsg_put() failed in notify_initial_state_done(),
the skb will be freed by nlmsg_free(skb).
Then get_initial_state will goto out and the freed skb will be used by
return value skb->len, which is a uaf bug.

What's worse, the same problem goes even further: skb can also be
freed in the notify_*_state_change -> notify_*_state calls below.
Thus 4 additional uaf bugs happened.

My patch lets the problem callee functions: notify_initial_state_done
and notify_*_state_change return an error code if errors happen.
So that the error codes could be propagated and the uaf bugs can be avoid.

v2 reports a compilation warning. This v3 fixed this warning and built
successfully in my local environment with no additional warnings.
v2: https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1435218/

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49085 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
