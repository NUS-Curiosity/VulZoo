Subject: CVE-2022-49616: ASoC: rt7*-sdw: harden jack_detect_handler

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: rt7*-sdw: harden jack_detect_handler

Realtek headset codec drivers typically check if the card is
instantiated before proceeding with the jack detection.

The rt700, rt711 and rt711-sdca are however missing a check on the
card pointer, which can lead to NULL dereferences encountered in
driver bind/unbind tests.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49616 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
