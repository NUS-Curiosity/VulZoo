Subject: CVE-2022-49220: dax: make sure inodes are flushed before destroy cache

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dax: make sure inodes are flushed before destroy cache

A bug can be triggered by following command

$ modprobe nd_pmem && modprobe -r nd_pmem

[   10.060014] BUG dax_cache (Not tainted): Objects remaining in dax_cache on __kmem_cache_shutdown()
[   10.060938] Slab 0x0000000085b729ac objects=9 used=1 fp=0x000000004f5ae469 flags=0x200000000010200(slab|head|node)

[   10.064058]  __x64_sys_delete_module+0x265/0x300

This is caused by dax_fs_exit() not flushing inodes before destroy cache.
To fix this issue, call rcu_barrier() before destroy cache.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49220 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
