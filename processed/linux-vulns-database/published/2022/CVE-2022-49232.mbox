Subject: CVE-2022-49232: drm/amd/display: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in amdgpu_dm_connector_add_common_modes()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix a NULL pointer dereference in amdgpu_dm_connector_add_common_modes()

In amdgpu_dm_connector_add_common_modes(), amdgpu_dm_create_common_mode()
is assigned to mode and is passed to drm_mode_probed_add() directly after
that. drm_mode_probed_add() passes &mode->head to list_add_tail(), and
there is a dereference of it in list_add_tail() without recoveries, which
could lead to NULL pointer dereference on failure of
amdgpu_dm_create_common_mode().

Fix this by adding a NULL check of mode.

This bug was found by a static analyzer.

Builds with 'make allyesconfig' show no new warnings,
and our static analyzer no longer warns about this code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49232 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
