Subject: CVE-2022-49549: x86/MCE/AMD: Fix memory leak when threshold_create_bank() fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/MCE/AMD: Fix memory leak when threshold_create_bank() fails

In mce_threshold_create_device(), if threshold_create_bank() fails, the
previously allocated threshold banks array @bp will be leaked because
the call to mce_threshold_remove_device() will not free it.

This happens because mce_threshold_remove_device() fetches the pointer
through the threshold_banks per-CPU variable but bp is written there
only after the bank creation is successful, and not before, when
threshold_create_bank() fails.

Add a helper which unwinds all the bank creation work previously done
and pass into it the previously allocated threshold banks array for
freeing.

  [ bp: Massage. ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49549 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
