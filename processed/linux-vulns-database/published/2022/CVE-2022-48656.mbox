Subject: CVE-2022-48656: dmaengine: ti: k3-udma-private: Fix refcount leak bug in of_xudma_dev_get()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: ti: k3-udma-private: Fix refcount leak bug in of_xudma_dev_get()

We should call of_node_put() for the reference returned by
of_parse_phandle() in fail path or when it is not used anymore.
Here we only need to move the of_node_put() before the check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48656 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
