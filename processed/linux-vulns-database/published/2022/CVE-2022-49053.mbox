Subject: CVE-2022-49053: scsi: target: tcmu: Fix possible page UAF

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: tcmu: Fix possible page UAF

tcmu_try_get_data_page() looks up pages under cmdr_lock, but it does not
take refcount properly and just returns page pointer. When
tcmu_try_get_data_page() returns, the returned page may have been freed by
tcmu_blocks_release().

We need to get_page() under cmdr_lock to avoid concurrent
tcmu_blocks_release().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49053 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
