The problem is that the device passed to clear_caseopen() is the hwmon
device, not the platform device, and the platform data is not set in the
hwmon device. Store the pointer to sio_data in struct nct6775_data and
get if from there if needed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48750 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cfb7d12f2e4a4d694f49e9b4ebb352f7b67cdfbb
