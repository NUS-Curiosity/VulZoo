Subject: CVE-2022-49400: md: Don't set mddev private to NULL in raid0 pers->free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md: Don't set mddev private to NULL in raid0 pers->free

In normal stop process, it does like this:
   do_md_stop
      |
   __md_stop (pers->free(); mddev->private=NULL)
      |
   md_free (free mddev)
__md_stop sets mddev->private to NULL after pers->free. The raid device
will be stopped and mddev memory is free. But in reshape, it doesn't
free the mddev and mddev will still be used in new raid.

In reshape, it first sets mddev->private to new_pers and then runs
old_pers->free(). Now raid0 sets mddev->private to NULL in raid0_free.
The new raid can't work anymore. It will panic when dereference
mddev->private because of NULL pointer dereference.

It can panic like this:

Removing the code that sets mddev->private to NULL in raid0 can fix
problem.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
