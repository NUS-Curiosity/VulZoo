Subject: CVE-2022-49377: blk-mq: don't touch ->tagset in blk_mq_get_sq_hctx

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: don't touch ->tagset in blk_mq_get_sq_hctx

blk_mq_run_hw_queues() could be run when there isn't queued request and
after queue is cleaned up, at that time tagset is freed, because tagset
lifetime is covered by driver, and often freed after blk_cleanup_queue()
returns.

So don't touch ->tagset for figuring out current default hctx by the mapping
built in request queue, so use-after-free on tagset can be avoided. Meantime
this way should be fast than retrieving mapping from tagset.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49377 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
