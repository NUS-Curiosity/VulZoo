Subject: CVE-2022-49273: rtc: pl031: fix rtc features null pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtc: pl031: fix rtc features null pointer dereference

When there is no interrupt line, rtc alarm feature is disabled.

The clearing of the alarm feature bit was being done prior to allocations
of ldata->rtc device, resulting in a null pointer dereference.

Clear RTC_FEATURE_ALARM after the rtc device is allocated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49273 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
