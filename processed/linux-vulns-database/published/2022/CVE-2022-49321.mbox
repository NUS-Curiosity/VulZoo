Subject: CVE-2022-49321: xprtrdma: treat all calls not a bcall when bc_serv is NULL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xprtrdma: treat all calls not a bcall when bc_serv is NULL

When a rdma server returns a fault format reply, nfs v3 client may
treats it as a bcall when bc service is not exist.

The debug message at rpcrdma_bc_receive_call are,

[56579.837169] RPC:       rpcrdma_bc_receive_call: callback XID
00000001, length=20
[56579.837174] RPC:       rpcrdma_bc_receive_call: 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04

After that, rpcrdma_bc_receive_call will meets NULL pointer as,

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
