Subject: CVE-2022-49659: can: m_can: m_can_{read_fifo,echo_tx_event}(): shift timestamp to full 32 bits

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: m_can: m_can_{read_fifo,echo_tx_event}(): shift timestamp to full 32 bits

In commit 1be37d3b0414 ("can: m_can: fix periph RX path: use
rx-offload to ensure skbs are sent from softirq context") the RX path
for peripheral devices was switched to RX-offload.

Received CAN frames are pushed to RX-offload together with a
timestamp. RX-offload is designed to handle overflows of the timestamp
correctly, if 32 bit timestamps are provided.

The timestamps of m_can core are only 16 bits wide. So this patch
shifts them to full 32 bit before passing them to RX-offload.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49659 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
