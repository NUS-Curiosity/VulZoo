Subject: CVE-2022-49306: usb: dwc3: host: Stop setting the ACPI companion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: host: Stop setting the ACPI companion

It is no longer needed. The sysdev pointer is now used when
assigning the ACPI companions to the xHCI ports and USB
devices.

Assigning the ACPI companion here resulted in the
fwnode->secondary pointer to be replaced also for the parent
dwc3 device since the primary fwnode (the ACPI companion)
was shared. That was unintentional and it created potential
side effects like resource leaks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49306 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
