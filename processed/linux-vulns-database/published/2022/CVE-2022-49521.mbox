Subject: CVE-2022-49521: scsi: lpfc: Fix resource leak in lpfc_sli4_send_seq_to_ulp()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix resource leak in lpfc_sli4_send_seq_to_ulp()

If no handler is found in lpfc_complete_unsol_iocb() to match the rctl of a
received frame, the frame is dropped and resources are leaked.

Fix by returning resources when discarding an unhandled frame type.  Update
lpfc_fc_frame_check() handling of NOP basic link service.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49521 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
