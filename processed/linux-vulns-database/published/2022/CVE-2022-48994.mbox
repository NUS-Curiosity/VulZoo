Subject: CVE-2022-48994: ALSA: seq: Fix function prototype mismatch in snd_seq_expand_var_event

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: seq: Fix function prototype mismatch in snd_seq_expand_var_event

With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed.

seq_copy_in_user() and seq_copy_in_kernel() did not have prototypes
matching snd_seq_dump_func_t. Adjust this and remove the casts. There
are not resulting binary output differences.

This was found as a result of Clang's new -Wcast-function-type-strict
flag, which is more sensitive than the simpler -Wcast-function-type,
which only checks for type width mismatches.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48994 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
