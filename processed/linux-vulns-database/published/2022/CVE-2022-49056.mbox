Subject: CVE-2022-49056: io_uring: abort file assignment prior to assigning creds

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: abort file assignment prior to assigning creds

We need to either restore creds properly if we fail on the file
assignment, or just do the file assignment first instead. Let's do
the latter as it's simpler, should make no difference here for
file assignment.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49056 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 5.17.3 with commit 2c443b22756cf75dc594d4d32bf64505bf4ce84b and fixed in 5.17.4 with commit 262960775e0d2cdf97a3e33993e95e13175df4bb

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

	fs/io_uring.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
