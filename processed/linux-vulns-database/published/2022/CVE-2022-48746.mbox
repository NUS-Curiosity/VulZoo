Subject: CVE-2022-48746: net/mlx5e: Fix handling of wrong devices during bond netevent

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix handling of wrong devices during bond netevent

Current implementation of bond netevent handler only check if
the handled netdev is VF representor and it missing a check if
the VF representor is on the same phys device of the bond handling
the netevent.

Fix by adding the missing check and optimizing the check if
the netdev is VF representor so it will not access uninitialized
private data and crashes.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
