Subject: CVE-2022-48966: net: mvneta: Prevent out of bounds read in mvneta_config_rss()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mvneta: Prevent out of bounds read in mvneta_config_rss()

The pp->indir[0] value comes from the user.  It is passed to:

	if (cpu_online(pp->rxq_def))

inside the mvneta_percpu_elect() function.  It needs bounds checkeding
to ensure that it is not beyond the end of the cpu bitmap.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48966 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
