Subject: CVE-2022-49134: mlxsw: spectrum: Guard against invalid local ports

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum: Guard against invalid local ports

When processing events generated by the device's firmware, the driver
protects itself from events reported for non-existent local ports, but
not for the CPU port (local port 0), which exists, but does not have all
the fields as any local port.

This can result in a NULL pointer dereference when trying access
'struct mlxsw_sp_port' fields which are not initialized for CPU port.

Commit 63b08b1f6834 ("mlxsw: spectrum: Protect driver from buggy firmware")
already handled such issue by bailing early when processing a PUDE event
reported for the CPU port.

Generalize the approach by moving the check to a common function and
making use of it in all relevant places.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49134 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4cad27ba2e5a5843a7fab5aa30de2b8e8c3db3a8
