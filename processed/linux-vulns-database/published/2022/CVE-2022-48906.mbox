Subject: CVE-2022-48906: mptcp: Correctly set DATA_FIN timeout when number of retransmits is large

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: Correctly set DATA_FIN timeout when number of retransmits is large

Syzkaller with UBSAN uncovered a scenario where a large number of
DATA_FIN retransmits caused a shift-out-of-bounds in the DATA_FIN
timeout calculation:

================================================================================
UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in net/mptcp/protocol.c:470:29
shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'unsigned int'
CPU: 1 PID: 13059 Comm: kworker/1:0 Not tainted 5.17.0-rc2-00630-g5fbf21c90c60 #1
Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.13.0-1ubuntu1.1 04/01/2014
Workqueue: events mptcp_worker

================================================================================

This change limits the maximum timeout by limiting the size of the
shift, which keeps all intermediate values in-bounds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48906 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0c3f34beb459753f9f80d0cc14c1b50ab615c631
