Subject: CVE-2022-49021: net: phy: fix null-ptr-deref while probe() failed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: fix null-ptr-deref while probe() failed

I got a null-ptr-deref report as following when doing fault injection test:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000058
Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI
CPU: 1 PID: 253 Comm: 507-spi-dm9051 Tainted: G    B            N 6.1.0-rc3+
Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.13.0-1ubuntu1.1 04/01/2014
RIP: 0010:klist_put+0x2d/0xd0

//probe path:
phy_device_register()
  device_add()

phy_connect
  phy_attach_direct() //set device driver
    probe() //it's failed, driver is not bound
    device_bind_driver() // probe failed, it's not called

//remove path:
phy_device_remove()
  device_del()
    device_release_driver_internal()
      __device_release_driver() //dev->drv is not NULL
        klist_remove() <- knode_driver is not added yet, cause null-ptr-deref

In phy_attach_direct(), after setting the 'dev->driver', probe() fails,
device_bind_driver() is not called, so the knode_driver->n_klist is not
set, then it causes null-ptr-deref in __device_release_driver() while
deleting device. Fix this by setting dev->driver to NULL in the error
path in phy_attach_direct().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49021 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
