Subject: CVE-2022-49592: net: stmmac: fix dma queue left shift overflow issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: fix dma queue left shift overflow issue

When queue number is > 4, left shift overflows due to 32 bits
integer variable. Mask calculation is wrong for MTL_RXQ_DMA_MAP1.

If CONFIG_UBSAN is enabled, kernel dumps below warning:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
