Subject: CVE-2022-49410: tracing: Fix potential double free in create_var_ref()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix potential double free in create_var_ref()

In create_var_ref(), init_var_ref() is called to initialize the fields
of variable ref_field, which is allocated in the previous function call
to create_hist_field(). Function init_var_ref() allocates the
corresponding fields such as ref_field->system, but frees these fields
when the function encounters an error. The caller later calls
destroy_hist_field() to conduct error handling, which frees the fields
and the variable itself. This results in double free of the fields which
are already freed in the previous function.

Fix this by storing NULL to the corresponding fields when they are freed
in init_var_ref().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49410 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
