Subject: CVE-2022-49399: tty: goldfish: Use tty_port_destroy() to destroy port

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: goldfish: Use tty_port_destroy() to destroy port

In goldfish_tty_probe(), the port initialized through tty_port_init()
should be destroyed in error paths.In goldfish_tty_remove(), qtty->port
also should be destroyed or else might leak resources.

Fix the above by calling tty_port_destroy().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49399 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
