Subject: CVE-2022-48637: bnxt: prevent skb UAF after handing over to PTP worker

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt: prevent skb UAF after handing over to PTP worker

When reading the timestamp is required bnxt_tx_int() hands
over the ownership of the completed skb to the PTP worker.
The skb should not be used afterwards, as the worker may
run before the rest of our code and free the skb, leading
to a use-after-free.

Since dev_kfree_skb_any() accepts NULL make the loss of
ownership more obvious and set skb to NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48637 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
