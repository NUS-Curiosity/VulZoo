Subject: CVE-2022-48728: IB/hfi1: Fix AIP early init panic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/hfi1: Fix AIP early init panic

An early failure in hfi1_ipoib_setup_rn() can lead to the following panic:

The panic happens in hfi1_ipoib_txreq_deinit() because there is a NULL
deref when hfi1_ipoib_netdev_dtor() is called in this error case.

hfi1_ipoib_txreq_init() and hfi1_ipoib_rxq_init() are self unwinding so
fix by adjusting the error paths accordingly.

Other changes:
- hfi1_ipoib_free_rdma_netdev() is deleted including the free_netdev()
  since the netdev core code deletes calls free_netdev()
- The switch to the accelerated entrances is moved to the success path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48728 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
