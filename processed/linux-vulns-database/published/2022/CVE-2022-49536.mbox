Subject: CVE-2022-49536: scsi: lpfc: Fix SCSI I/O completion and abort handler deadlock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix SCSI I/O completion and abort handler deadlock

During stress I/O tests with 500+ vports, hard LOCKUP call traces are
observed.

CPU A:
 native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x192
 _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x32
 lpfc_handle_fcp_err+0x4c6
 lpfc_fcp_io_cmd_wqe_cmpl+0x964
 lpfc_sli4_fp_handle_cqe+0x266
 __lpfc_sli4_process_cq+0x105
 __lpfc_sli4_hba_process_cq+0x3c
 lpfc_cq_poll_hdler+0x16
 irq_poll_softirq+0x76
 __softirqentry_text_start+0xe4
 irq_exit+0xf7
 do_IRQ+0x7f

CPU B:
 native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x5b
 _raw_spin_lock+0x1c
 lpfc_abort_handler+0x13e
 scmd_eh_abort_handler+0x85
 process_one_work+0x1a7
 worker_thread+0x30
 kthread+0x112
 ret_from_fork+0x1f

Diagram of lockup:

CPUA                            CPUB
----                            ----
lpfc_cmd->buf_lock
                            phba->hbalock
                            lpfc_cmd->buf_lock
phba->hbalock

Fix by reordering the taking of the lpfc_cmd->buf_lock and phba->hbalock in
lpfc_abort_handler routine so that it tries to take the lpfc_cmd->buf_lock
first before phba->hbalock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49536 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
