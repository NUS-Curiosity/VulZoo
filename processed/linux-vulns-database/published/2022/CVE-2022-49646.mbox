Subject: CVE-2022-49646: wifi: mac80211: fix queue selection for mesh/OCB interfaces

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix queue selection for mesh/OCB interfaces

When using iTXQ, the code assumes that there is only one vif queue for
broadcast packets, using the BE queue. Allowing non-BE queue marking
violates that assumption and txq->ac == skb_queue_mapping is no longer
guaranteed. This can cause issues with queue handling in the driver and
also causes issues with the recent ATF change, resulting in an AQL
underflow warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49646 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
