Subject: CVE-2022-49615: ASoC: rt711-sdca: fix kernel NULL pointer dereference when IO error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: rt711-sdca: fix kernel NULL pointer dereference when IO error

The initial settings will be written before the codec probe function.
But, the rt711->component doesn't be assigned yet.
If IO error happened during initial settings operations, it will cause the kernel panic.
This patch changed component->dev to slave->dev to fix this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49615 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
