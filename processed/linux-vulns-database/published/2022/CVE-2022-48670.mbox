Subject: CVE-2022-48670: peci: cpu: Fix use-after-free in adev_release()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

peci: cpu: Fix use-after-free in adev_release()

When auxiliary_device_add() returns an error, auxiliary_device_uninit()
is called, which causes refcount for device to be decremented and
.release callback will be triggered.

Because adev_release() re-calls auxiliary_device_uninit(), it will cause
use-after-free:
[ 1269.455172] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 14267 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0x110/0x15
[ 1269.464007] refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48670 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c87f1f99e26ea4ae08cabe753ae98e5626bdba89
