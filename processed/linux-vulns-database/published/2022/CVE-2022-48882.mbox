Subject: CVE-2022-48882: net/mlx5e: Fix macsec possible null dereference when updating MAC security entity (SecY)

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix macsec possible null dereference when updating MAC security entity (SecY)

Upon updating MAC security entity (SecY) in hw offload path, the macsec
security association (SA) initialization routine is called. In case of
extended packet number (epn) is enabled the salt and ssci attributes are
retrieved using the MACsec driver rx_sa context which is unavailable when
updating a SecY property such as encoding-sa hence the null dereference.
Fix by using the provided SA to set those attributes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48882 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
