Subject: CVE-2022-49731: ata: libata-core: fix NULL pointer deref in ata_host_alloc_pinfo()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ata: libata-core: fix NULL pointer deref in ata_host_alloc_pinfo()

In an unlikely (and probably wrong?) case that the 'ppi' parameter of
ata_host_alloc_pinfo() points to an array starting with a NULL pointer,
there's going to be a kernel oops as the 'pi' local variable won't get
reassigned from the initial value of NULL. Initialize 'pi' instead to
'&ata_dummy_port_info' to fix the possible kernel oops for good...

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static
analysis tool.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49731 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
