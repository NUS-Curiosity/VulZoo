Subject: CVE-2022-48667: smb3: fix temporary data corruption in insert range

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb3: fix temporary data corruption in insert range

insert range doesn't discard the affected cached region
so can risk temporarily corrupting file data.

Also includes some minor cleanup (avoiding rereading
inode size repeatedly unnecessarily) to make it clearer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48667 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0cdde8460c304283d4ebe3f767a70215d1ab9d4e
