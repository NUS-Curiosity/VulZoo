Subject: CVE-2022-49188: remoteproc: qcom_q6v5_mss: Fix some leaks in q6v5_alloc_memory_region

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: qcom_q6v5_mss: Fix some leaks in q6v5_alloc_memory_region

The device_node pointer is returned by of_parse_phandle() or
of_get_child_by_name() with refcount incremented.
We should use of_node_put() on it when done.

This function only call of_node_put(node) when of_address_to_resource
succeeds, missing error cases.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49188 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
