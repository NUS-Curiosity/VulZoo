Subject: CVE-2022-48654: netfilter: nfnetlink_osf: fix possible bogus match in nf_osf_find()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nfnetlink_osf: fix possible bogus match in nf_osf_find()

nf_osf_find() incorrectly returns true on mismatch, this leads to
copying uninitialized memory area in nft_osf which can be used to leak
stale kernel stack data to userspace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48654 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
