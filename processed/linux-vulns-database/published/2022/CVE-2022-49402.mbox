Subject: CVE-2022-49402: ftrace: Clean up hash direct_functions on register failures

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Clean up hash direct_functions on register failures

We see the following GPF when register_ftrace_direct fails:

One way to trigger this is:
  1. load a livepatch that patches kernel function xxx;
  2. run bpftrace -e 'kfunc:xxx {}', this will fail (expected for now);
  3. repeat #2 => gpf.

This is because the entry is added to direct_functions, but not removed.
Fix this by remove the entry from direct_functions when
register_ftrace_direct fails.

Also remove the last trailing space from ftrace.c, so we don't have to
worry about it anymore.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49402 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
