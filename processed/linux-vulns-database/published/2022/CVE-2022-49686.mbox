Subject: CVE-2022-49686: usb: gadget: uvc: fix list double add in uvcg_video_pump

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: uvc: fix list double add in uvcg_video_pump

A panic can occur if the endpoint becomes disabled and the
uvcg_video_pump adds the request back to the req_free list after it has
already been queued to the endpoint. The endpoint complete will add the
request back to the req_free list. Invalidate the local request handle
once it's been queued.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d95ac8b920de1d39525fadc408ce675697626ca6
