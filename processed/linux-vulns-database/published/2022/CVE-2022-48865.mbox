Subject: CVE-2022-48865: tipc: fix kernel panic when enabling bearer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tipc: fix kernel panic when enabling bearer

When enabling a bearer on a node, a kernel panic is observed:

The node in question is receiving activate messages in another
thread after changing bearer status to allow message sending/
receiving in current thread:

Monitoring pointer in thread 2 is dereferenced before monitoring data
is allocated in thread 1. This causes kernel panic.

This commit fixes it by allocating the monitoring data before enabling
the bearer to receive messages.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48865 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
