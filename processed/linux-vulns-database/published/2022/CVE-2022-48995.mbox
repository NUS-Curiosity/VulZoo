Subject: CVE-2022-48995: Input: raydium_ts_i2c - fix memory leak in raydium_i2c_send()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: raydium_ts_i2c - fix memory leak in raydium_i2c_send()

There is a kmemleak when test the raydium_i2c_ts with bpf mock device:

After BANK_SWITCH command from i2c BUS, no matter success or error
happened, the tx_buf should be freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48995 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
