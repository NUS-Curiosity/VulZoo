Subject: CVE-2022-48999: ipv4: Handle attempt to delete multipath route when fib_info contains an nh reference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv4: Handle attempt to delete multipath route when fib_info contains an nh reference

Gwangun Jung reported a slab-out-of-bounds access in fib_nh_match:
    fib_nh_match+0xf98/0x1130 linux-6.0-rc7/net/ipv4/fib_semantics.c:961
    fib_table_delete+0x5f3/0xa40 linux-6.0-rc7/net/ipv4/fib_trie.c:1753
    inet_rtm_delroute+0x2b3/0x380 linux-6.0-rc7/net/ipv4/fib_frontend.c:874

Separate nexthop objects are mutually exclusive with the legacy
multipath spec. Fix fib_nh_match to return if the config for the
to be deleted route contains a multipath spec while the fib_info
is using a nexthop object.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48999 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
