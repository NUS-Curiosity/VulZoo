Subject: CVE-2022-49512: mtd: rawnand: denali: Use managed device resources

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: rawnand: denali: Use managed device resources

All of the resources used by this driver has managed interfaces, so use
them. Otherwise we will get the following splat:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
