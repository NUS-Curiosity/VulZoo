Subject: CVE-2022-49551: usb: isp1760: Fix out-of-bounds array access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: isp1760: Fix out-of-bounds array access

Running the driver through kasan gives an interesting splat:

  BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in isp1760_register+0x180/0x70c
  Read of size 20 at addr f1db2e64 by task swapper/0/1
  (...)
  isp1760_register from isp1760_plat_probe+0x1d8/0x220
  (...)

This happens because the loop reading the regmap fields for the
different ISP1760 variants look like this:

  for (i = 0; i < HC_FIELD_MAX; i++) { ... }

Meaning it expects the arrays to be at least HC_FIELD_MAX - 1 long.

However the arrays isp1760_hc_reg_fields[], isp1763_hc_reg_fields[],
isp1763_hc_volatile_ranges[] and isp1763_dc_volatile_ranges[] are
dynamically sized during compilation.

Fix this by putting an empty assignment to the [HC_FIELD_MAX]
and [DC_FIELD_MAX] array member at the end of each array.
This will make the array one member longer than it needs to be,
but avoids the risk of overwriting whatever is inside
[HC_FIELD_MAX - 1] and is simple and intuitive to read. Also
add comments explaining what is going on.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49551 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
