Subject: CVE-2022-49249: ASoC: codecs: wc938x: fix accessing array out of bounds for enum type

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: codecs: wc938x: fix accessing array out of bounds for enum type

Accessing enums using integer would result in array out of bounds access
on platforms like aarch64 where sizeof(long) is 8 compared to enum size
which is 4 bytes.

Fix this by using enumerated items instead of integers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49249 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
