Subject: CVE-2022-49161: ASoC: mediatek: Fix error handling in mt8183_da7219_max98357_dev_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: mediatek: Fix error handling in mt8183_da7219_max98357_dev_probe

The device_node pointer is returned by of_parse_phandle()  with refcount
incremented. We should use of_node_put() on it when done.

This function only calls of_node_put() in the regular path.
And it will cause refcount leak in error paths.
Fix this by calling of_node_put() in error handling too.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49161 to this issue.

	Fixed in 5.17.2 with commit 9b9f6227e8d0c7c46b6d9d7b8a5c4e0536049fcf

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9b9f6227e8d0c7c46b6d9d7b8a5c4e0536049fcf
