Subject: CVE-2022-49478: media: pvrusb2: fix array-index-out-of-bounds in pvr2_i2c_core_init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: pvrusb2: fix array-index-out-of-bounds in pvr2_i2c_core_init

Syzbot reported that -1 is used as array index. The problem was in
missing validation check.

hdw->unit_number is initialized with -1 and then if init table walk fails
this value remains unchanged. Since code blindly uses this member for
array indexing adding sanity check is the easiest fix for that.

hdw->workpoll initialization moved upper to prevent warning in
__flush_work.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49478 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
