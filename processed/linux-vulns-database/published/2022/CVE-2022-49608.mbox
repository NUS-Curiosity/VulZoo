Subject: CVE-2022-49608: pinctrl: ralink: Check for null return of devm_kcalloc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: ralink: Check for null return of devm_kcalloc

Because of the possible failure of the allocation, data->domains might
be NULL pointer and will cause the dereference of the NULL pointer
later.
Therefore, it might be better to check it and directly return -ENOMEM
without releasing data manually if fails, because the comment of the
devm_kmalloc() says "Memory allocated with this function is
automatically freed on driver detach.".

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49608 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
