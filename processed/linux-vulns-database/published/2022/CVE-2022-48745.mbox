Subject: CVE-2022-48745: net/mlx5: Use del_timer_sync in fw reset flow of halting poll

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Use del_timer_sync in fw reset flow of halting poll

Substitute del_timer() with del_timer_sync() in fw reset polling
deactivation flow, in order to prevent a race condition which occurs
when del_timer() is called and timer is deactivated while another
process is handling the timer interrupt. A situation that led to
the following call trace:
	RIP: 0010:run_timer_softirq+0x137/0x420
	<IRQ>
	recalibrate_cpu_khz+0x10/0x10
	ktime_get+0x3e/0xa0
	? sched_clock_cpu+0xb/0xc0
	__do_softirq+0xf5/0x2ea
	irq_exit_rcu+0xc1/0xf0
	sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x9e/0xc0
	asm_sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x12/0x20
	</IRQ>

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48745 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
