Subject: CVE-2022-49044: dm integrity: fix memory corruption when tag_size is less than digest size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm integrity: fix memory corruption when tag_size is less than digest size

It is possible to set up dm-integrity in such a way that the
"tag_size" parameter is less than the actual digest size. In this
situation, a part of the digest beyond tag_size is ignored.

In this case, dm-integrity would write beyond the end of the
ic->recalc_tags array and corrupt memory. The corruption happened in
integrity_recalc->integrity_sector_checksum->crypto_shash_final.

Fix this corruption by increasing the tags array so that it has enough
padding at the end to accomodate the loop in integrity_recalc() being
able to write a full digest size for the last member of the tags
array.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49044 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
