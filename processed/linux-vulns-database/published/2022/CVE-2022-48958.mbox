Subject: CVE-2022-48958: ethernet: aeroflex: fix potential skb leak in greth_init_rings()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ethernet: aeroflex: fix potential skb leak in greth_init_rings()

The greth_init_rings() function won't free the newly allocated skb when
dma_mapping_error() returns error, so add dev_kfree_skb() to fix it.

Compile tested only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-48958 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
