Subject: CVE-2022-49458: drm/msm: don't free the IRQ if it was not requested

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: don't free the IRQ if it was not requested

As msm_drm_uninit() is called from the msm_drm_init() error path,
additional care should be necessary as not to call the free_irq() for
the IRQ that was not requested before (because an error occured earlier
than the request_irq() call).

This fixed the issue reported with the following backtrace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
