Subject: CVE-2022-48802: fs/proc: task_mmu.c: don't read mapcount for migration entry

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/proc: task_mmu.c: don't read mapcount for migration entry

The syzbot reported the below BUG:

The reproducer was trying to read /proc/$PID/smaps when calling
MADV_FREE at the mean time.  MADV_FREE may split THPs if it is called
for partial THP.  It may trigger the below race:

           CPU A                         CPU B
           -----                         -----
  smaps walk:                      MADV_FREE:
  page_mapcount()
    PageCompound()
                                   split_huge_page()
    page = compound_head(page)
    PageDoubleMap(page)

When calling PageDoubleMap() this page is not a tail page of THP anymore
so the BUG is triggered.

This could be fixed by elevated refcount of the page before calling
mapcount, but that would prevent it from counting migration entries, and
it seems overkilling because the race just could happen when PMD is
split so all PTE entries of tail pages are actually migration entries,
and smaps_account() does treat migration entries as mapcount == 1 as
Kirill pointed out.

Add a new parameter for smaps_account() to tell this entry is migration
entry then skip calling page_mapcount().  Don't skip getting mapcount
for device private entries since they do track references with mapcount.

Pagemap also has the similar issue although it was not reported.  Fixed
it as well.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
