Subject: CVE-2022-49393: misc: fastrpc: fix list iterator in fastrpc_req_mem_unmap_impl

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: fastrpc: fix list iterator in fastrpc_req_mem_unmap_impl

This is another instance of incorrect use of list iterator and
checking it for NULL.

The list iterator value 'map' will *always* be set and non-NULL
by list_for_each_entry(), so it is incorrect to assume that the
iterator value will be NULL if the list is empty (in this case, the
check 'if (!map) {' will always be false and never exit as expected).

To fix the bug, use a new variable 'iter' as the list iterator,
while use the original variable 'map' as a dedicated pointer to
point to the found element.

Without this patch, Kernel crashes with below trace:

Unable to handle kernel access to user memory outside uaccess routines
 at virtual address 0000ffff7fb03750

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2d12905aad462383f4e7a5fdb024d2b7ae2d10cf
