Subject: CVE-2022-49186: clk: visconti: prevent array overflow in visconti_clk_register_gates()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: visconti: prevent array overflow in visconti_clk_register_gates()

This code was using -1 to represent that there was no reset function.
Unfortunately, the -1 was stored in u8 so the if (clks[i].rs_id >= 0)
condition was always true.  This lead to an out of bounds access in
visconti_clk_register_gates().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49186 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
