Subject: CVE-2022-49425: f2fs: fix dereference of stale list iterator after loop body

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix dereference of stale list iterator after loop body

The list iterator variable will be a bogus pointer if no break was hit.
Dereferencing it (cur->page in this case) could load an out-of-bounds/undefined
value making it unsafe to use that in the comparision to determine if the
specific element was found.

Since 'cur->page' *can* be out-ouf-bounds it cannot be guaranteed that
by chance (or intention of an attacker) it matches the value of 'page'
even though the correct element was not found.

This is fixed by using a separate list iterator variable for the loop
and only setting the original variable if a suitable element was found.
Then determing if the element was found is simply checking if the
variable is set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49425 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
