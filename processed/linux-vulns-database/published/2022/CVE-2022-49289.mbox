Subject: CVE-2022-49289: uaccess: fix integer overflow on access_ok()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uaccess: fix integer overflow on access_ok()

Three architectures check the end of a user access against the
address limit without taking a possible overflow into account.
Passing a negative length or another overflow in here returns
success when it should not.

Use the most common correct implementation here, which optimizes
for a constant 'size' argument, and turns the common case into a
single comparison.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49289 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
