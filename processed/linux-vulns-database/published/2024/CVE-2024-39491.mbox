Subject: CVE-2024-39491: ALSA: hda: cs35l56: Fix lifetime of cs_dsp instance

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: cs35l56: Fix lifetime of cs_dsp instance

The cs_dsp instance is initialized in the driver probe() so it
should be freed in the driver remove(). Also fix a missing call
to cs_dsp_remove() in the error path of cs35l56_hda_common_probe().

The call to cs_dsp_remove() was being done in the component unbind
callback cs35l56_hda_unbind(). This meant that if the driver was
unbound and then re-bound it would be using an uninitialized cs_dsp
instance.

It is best to initialize the cs_dsp instance in probe() so that it
can return an error if it fails. The component binding API doesn't
have any error handling so there's no way to handle a failure if
cs_dsp was initialized in the bind.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39491 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
