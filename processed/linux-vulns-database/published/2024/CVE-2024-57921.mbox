Subject: CVE-2024-57921: drm/amdgpu: Add a lock when accessing the buddy trim function

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Add a lock when accessing the buddy trim function

When running YouTube videos and Steam games simultaneously,
the tester found a system hang / race condition issue with
the multi-display configuration setting. Adding a lock to
the buddy allocator's trim function would be the solution.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
