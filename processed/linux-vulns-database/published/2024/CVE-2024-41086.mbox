Subject: CVE-2024-41086: bcachefs: Fix sb_field_downgrade validation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bcachefs: Fix sb_field_downgrade validation

- bch2_sb_downgrade_validate() wasn't checking for a downgrade entry
  extending past the end of the superblock section

- for_each_downgrade_entry() is used in to_text() and needs to work on
  malformed input; it also was missing a check for a field extending
  past the end of the section

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41086 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
