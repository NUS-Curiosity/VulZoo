Subject: CVE-2024-49891: scsi: lpfc: Validate hdwq pointers before dereferencing in reset/errata paths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Validate hdwq pointers before dereferencing in reset/errata paths

When the HBA is undergoing a reset or is handling an errata event, NULL ptr
dereference crashes may occur in routines such as
lpfc_sli_flush_io_rings(), lpfc_dev_loss_tmo_callbk(), or
lpfc_abort_handler().

Add NULL ptr checks before dereferencing hdwq pointers that may have been
freed due to operations colliding with a reset or errata event handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49891 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
