Subject: CVE-2024-47675: bpf: Fix use-after-free in bpf_uprobe_multi_link_attach()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix use-after-free in bpf_uprobe_multi_link_attach()

If bpf_link_prime() fails, bpf_uprobe_multi_link_attach() goes to the
error_free label and frees the array of bpf_uprobe's without calling
bpf_uprobe_unregister().

This leaks bpf_uprobe->uprobe and worse, this frees bpf_uprobe->consumer
without removing it from the uprobe->consumers list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47675 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
