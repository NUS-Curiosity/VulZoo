Subject: CVE-2024-44966: binfmt_flat: Fix corruption when not offsetting data start

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binfmt_flat: Fix corruption when not offsetting data start

Commit 04d82a6d0881 ("binfmt_flat: allow not offsetting data start")
introduced a RISC-V specific variant of the FLAT format which does
not allocate any space for the (obsolete) array of shared library
pointers. However, it did not disable the code which initializes the
array, resulting in the corruption of sizeof(long) bytes before the DATA
segment, generally the end of the TEXT segment.

Introduce MAX_SHARED_LIBS_UPDATE which depends on the state of
CONFIG_BINFMT_FLAT_NO_DATA_START_OFFSET to guard the initialization of
the shared library pointer region so that it will only be initialized
if space is reserved for it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44966 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
