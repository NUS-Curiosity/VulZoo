Subject: CVE-2024-35915: nfc: nci: Fix uninit-value in nci_dev_up and nci_ntf_packet

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: nci: Fix uninit-value in nci_dev_up and nci_ntf_packet

syzbot reported the following uninit-value access issue [1][2]:

nci_rx_work() parses and processes received packet. When the payload
length is zero, each message type handler reads uninitialized payload
and KMSAN detects this issue. The receipt of a packet with a zero-size
payload is considered unexpected, and therefore, such packets should be
silently discarded.

This patch resolved this issue by checking payload size before calling
each message type handler codes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35915 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
