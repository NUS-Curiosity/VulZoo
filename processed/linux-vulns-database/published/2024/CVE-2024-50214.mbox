Subject: CVE-2024-50214: drm/connector: hdmi: Fix memory leak in drm_display_mode_from_cea_vic()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/connector: hdmi: Fix memory leak in drm_display_mode_from_cea_vic()

modprobe drm_connector_test and then rmmod drm_connector_test,
the following memory leak occurs.

The `mode` allocated in drm_mode_duplicate() called by
drm_display_mode_from_cea_vic() is not freed, which cause the memory leak:

	unreferenced object 0xffffff80cb0ee400 (size 128):

Free `mode` by using drm_kunit_display_mode_from_cea_vic()
to fix it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/df2b00685cd33cd85be8910c7d6d22c4ebbf18bb
