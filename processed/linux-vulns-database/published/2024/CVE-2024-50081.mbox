Subject: CVE-2024-50081: blk-mq: setup queue ->tag_set before initializing hctx

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-mq: setup queue ->tag_set before initializing hctx

Commit 7b815817aa58 ("blk-mq: add helper for checking if one CPU is mapped to specified hctx")
needs to check queue mapping via tag set in hctx's cpuhp handler.

However, q->tag_set may not be setup yet when the cpuhp handler is
enabled, then kernel oops is triggered.

Fix the issue by setup queue tag_set before initializing hctx.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50081 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
