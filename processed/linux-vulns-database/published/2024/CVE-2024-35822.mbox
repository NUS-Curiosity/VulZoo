Subject: CVE-2024-35822: usb: udc: remove warning when queue disabled ep

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: udc: remove warning when queue disabled ep

It is possible trigger below warning message from mass storage function,

WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 3839 at drivers/usb/gadget/udc/core.c:294 usb_ep_queue+0x7c/0x104
pc : usb_ep_queue+0x7c/0x104
lr : fsg_main_thread+0x494/0x1b3c

Root cause is mass storage function try to queue request from main thread,
but other thread may already disable ep when function disable.

As there is no function failure in the driver, in order to avoid effort
to fix warning, change WARN_ON_ONCE() in usb_ep_queue() to pr_debug().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35822 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
