Subject: CVE-2024-27393: xen-netfront: Add missing skb_mark_for_recycle

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen-netfront: Add missing skb_mark_for_recycle

Notice that skb_mark_for_recycle() is introduced later than fixes tag in
commit 6a5bcd84e886 ("page_pool: Allow drivers to hint on SKB recycling").

It is believed that fixes tag were missing a call to page_pool_release_page()
between v5.9 to v5.14, after which is should have used skb_mark_for_recycle().
Since v6.6 the call page_pool_release_page() were removed (in
commit 535b9c61bdef ("net: page_pool: hide page_pool_release_page()")
and remaining callers converted (in commit 6bfef2ec0172 ("Merge branch
'net-page_pool-remove-page_pool_release_page'")).

This leak became visible in v6.8 via commit dba1b8a7ab68 ("mm/page_pool: catch
page_pool memory leaks").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27393 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
