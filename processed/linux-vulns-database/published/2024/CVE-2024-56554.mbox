Subject: CVE-2024-56554: binder: fix freeze UAF in binder_release_work()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix freeze UAF in binder_release_work()

When a binder reference is cleaned up, any freeze work queued in the
associated process should also be removed. Otherwise, the reference is
freed while its ref->freeze.work is still queued in proc->work leading
to a use-after-free issue as shown by the following KASAN report:

This commit fixes the issue by ensuring any queued freeze work is removed
when cleaning up a binder reference.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fe39e0ea2d0ba7f508ff453c4c9a44a95ec0de29
