Subject: CVE-2024-58053: rxrpc: Fix handling of received connection abort

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Fix handling of received connection abort

Fix the handling of a connection abort that we've received.  Though the
abort is at the connection level, it needs propagating to the calls on that
connection.  Whilst the propagation bit is performed, the calls aren't then
woken up to go and process their termination, and as no further input is
forthcoming, they just hang.

Also add some tracing for the logging of connection aborts.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58053 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
