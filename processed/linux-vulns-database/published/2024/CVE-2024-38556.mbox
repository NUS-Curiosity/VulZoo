Subject: CVE-2024-38556: net/mlx5: Add a timeout to acquire the command queue semaphore

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Add a timeout to acquire the command queue semaphore

Prevent forced completion handling on an entry that has not yet been
assigned an index, causing an out of bounds access on idx = -22.
Instead of waiting indefinitely for the sem, blocking flow now waits for
index to be allocated or a sem acquisition timeout before beginning the
timer for FW completion.

Kernel log example:
mlx5_core 0000:06:00.0: wait_func_handle_exec_timeout:1128:(pid 185911): cmd[-22]: CREATE_UCTX(0xa04) No done completion

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38556 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
