Subject: CVE-2024-53114: x86/CPU/AMD: Clear virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE on Zen4 client

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/CPU/AMD: Clear virtualized VMLOAD/VMSAVE on Zen4 client

A number of Zen4 client SoCs advertise the ability to use virtualized
VMLOAD/VMSAVE, but using these instructions is reported to be a cause
of a random host reboot.

These instructions aren't intended to be advertised on Zen4 client
so clear the capability.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53114 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.11.10 with commit 00c713f84f477a85e524f34aad8fbd11a1c051f0
	Fixed in 6.12 with commit a5ca1dc46a6b610dd4627d8b633d6c84f9724ef0

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/x86/kernel/cpu/amd.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/00c713f84f477a85e524f34aad8fbd11a1c051f0
