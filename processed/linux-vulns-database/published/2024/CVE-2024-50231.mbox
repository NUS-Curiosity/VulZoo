Subject: CVE-2024-50231: iio: gts-helper: Fix memory leaks in iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: gts-helper: Fix memory leaks in iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table()

modprobe iio-test-gts and rmmod it, then the following memory leak
occurs:

It includes 5*5 times "size 64" memory leaks, which correspond to 5 times
test_init_iio_gain_scale() calls with gts_test_gains size 10 (10*size(int))
and gts_test_itimes size 5. It also includes 5*1 times "size 16"
memory leak, which correspond to one time __test_init_iio_gain_scale()
call with gts_test_gains_gain_low size 3 (3*size(int)) and gts_test_itimes
size 5.

The reason is that the per_time_gains[i] is not freed which is allocated in
the "gts->num_itime" for loop in iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50231 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/38d6e8be234d87b0eedca50309e25051888b39d1
