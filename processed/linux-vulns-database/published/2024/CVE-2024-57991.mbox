Subject: CVE-2024-57991: wifi: rtw89: chan: fix soft lockup in rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw89: chan: fix soft lockup in rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles()

During rtw89_entity_recalc_mgnt_roles(), there is a normalizing process
which will re-order the list if an entry with target pattern is found.
And once one is found, should have aborted the list_for_each_entry. But,
`break` just aborted the inner for-loop. The outer list_for_each_entry
still continues. Normally, only the first entry will match the target
pattern, and the re-ordering will change nothing, so there won't be
soft lockup. However, in some special cases, soft lockup would happen.

Fix it by `goto fill` to break from the list_for_each_entry.

The following is a sample of kernel log for this problem.

watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#1 stuck for 26s! [wpa_supplicant:2055]
[...]
RIP: 0010:rtw89_entity_recalc ([...] chan.c:392 chan.c:479) rtw89_core

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
