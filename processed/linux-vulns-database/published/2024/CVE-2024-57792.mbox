Subject: CVE-2024-57792: power: supply: gpio-charger: Fix set charge current limits

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: gpio-charger: Fix set charge current limits

Fix set charge current limits for devices which allow to set the lowest
charge current limit to be greater zero. If requested charge current limit
is below lowest limit, the index equals current_limit_map_size which leads
to accessing memory beyond allocated memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57792 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
