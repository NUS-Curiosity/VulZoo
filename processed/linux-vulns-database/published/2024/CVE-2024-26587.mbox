Subject: CVE-2024-26587: net: netdevsim: don't try to destroy PHC on VFs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: netdevsim: don't try to destroy PHC on VFs

PHC gets initialized in nsim_init_netdevsim(), which
is only called if (nsim_dev_port_is_pf()).

Create a counterpart of nsim_init_netdevsim() and
move the mock_phc_destroy() there.

This fixes a crash trying to destroy netdevsim with
VFs instantiated, as caught by running the devlink.sh test:

    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000b8

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/08aca65997fb6f233066883b1f1e653bcb1f26ca
