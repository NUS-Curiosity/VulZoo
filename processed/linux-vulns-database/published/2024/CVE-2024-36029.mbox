Subject: CVE-2024-36029: mmc: sdhci-msm: pervent access to suspended controller

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: sdhci-msm: pervent access to suspended controller

Generic sdhci code registers LED device and uses host->runtime_suspended
flag to protect access to it. The sdhci-msm driver doesn't set this flag,
which causes a crash when LED is accessed while controller is runtime
suspended. Fix this by setting the flag correctly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36029 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
