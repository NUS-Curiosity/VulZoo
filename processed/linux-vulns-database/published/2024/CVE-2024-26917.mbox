Subject: CVE-2024-26917: scsi: Revert "scsi: fcoe: Fix potential deadlock on &fip->ctlr_lock"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: Revert "scsi: fcoe: Fix potential deadlock on &fip->ctlr_lock"

This reverts commit 1a1975551943f681772720f639ff42fbaa746212.

This commit causes interrupts to be lost for FCoE devices, since it changed
sping locks from "bh" to "irqsave".

Instead, a work queue should be used, and will be addressed in a separate
commit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26917 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
