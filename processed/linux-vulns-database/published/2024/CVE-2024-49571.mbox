Subject: CVE-2024-49571: net/smc: check iparea_offset and ipv6_prefixes_cnt when receiving proposal msg

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: check iparea_offset and ipv6_prefixes_cnt when receiving proposal msg

When receiving proposal msg in server, the field iparea_offset
and the field ipv6_prefixes_cnt in proposal msg are from the
remote client and can not be fully trusted. Especially the
field iparea_offset, once exceed the max value, there has the
chance to access wrong address, and crash may happen.

This patch checks iparea_offset and ipv6_prefixes_cnt before using them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49571 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
