Subject: CVE-2024-35883: spi: mchp-pci1xxx: Fix a possible null pointer dereference in pci1xxx_spi_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: mchp-pci1xxx: Fix a possible null pointer dereference in pci1xxx_spi_probe

In function pci1xxxx_spi_probe, there is a potential null pointer that
may be caused by a failed memory allocation by the function devm_kzalloc.
Hence, a null pointer check needs to be added to prevent null pointer
dereferencing later in the code.

To fix this issue, spi_bus->spi_int[iter] should be checked. The memory
allocated by devm_kzalloc will be automatically released, so just directly
return -ENOMEM without worrying about memory leaks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35883 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b31a226097cf8cc3c9de5e855d97757fdb2bf06
