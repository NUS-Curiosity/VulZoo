Subject: CVE-2024-41027: Fix userfaultfd_api to return EINVAL as expected

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Fix userfaultfd_api to return EINVAL as expected

Currently if we request a feature that is not set in the Kernel config we
fail silently and return all the available features.  However, the man
page indicates we should return an EINVAL.

We need to fix this issue since we can end up with a Kernel warning should
a program request the feature UFFD_FEATURE_WP_UNPOPULATED on a kernel with
the config not set with this feature.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
