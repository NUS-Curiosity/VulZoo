Subject: CVE-2024-57890: RDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/uverbs: Prevent integer overflow issue

In the expression "cmd.wqe_size * cmd.wr_count", both variables are u32
values that come from the user so the multiplication can lead to integer
wrapping.  Then we pass the result to uverbs_request_next_ptr() which also
could potentially wrap.  The "cmd.sge_count * sizeof(struct ib_uverbs_sge)"
multiplication can also overflow on 32bit systems although it's fine on
64bit systems.

This patch does two things.  First, I've re-arranged the condition in
uverbs_request_next_ptr() so that the use controlled variable "len" is on
one side of the comparison by itself without any math.  Then I've modified
all the callers to use size_mul() for the multiplications.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57890 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
