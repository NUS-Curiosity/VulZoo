Subject: CVE-2024-56569: ftrace: Fix regression with module command in stack_trace_filter

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Fix regression with module command in stack_trace_filter

When executing the following command:

    # echo "write*:mod:ext3" > /sys/kernel/tracing/stack_trace_filter

The current mod command causes a null pointer dereference. While commit
0f17976568b3f ("ftrace: Fix regression with module command in stack_trace_filter")
has addressed part of the issue, it left a corner case unhandled, which still
results in a kernel crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56569 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
