Subject: CVE-2024-42089: ASoC: fsl-asoc-card: set priv->pdev before using it

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: fsl-asoc-card: set priv->pdev before using it

priv->pdev pointer was set after being used in
fsl_asoc_card_audmux_init().
Move this assignment at the start of the probe function, so
sub-functions can correctly use pdev through priv.

fsl_asoc_card_audmux_init() dereferences priv->pdev to get access to the
dev struct, used with dev_err macros.
As priv is zero-initialised, there would be a NULL pointer dereference.
Note that if priv->dev is dereferenced before assignment but never used,
for example if there is no error to be printed, the driver won't crash
probably due to compiler optimisations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42089 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
