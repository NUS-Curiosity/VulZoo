Subject: CVE-2024-49970: drm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN401

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN401

'stream_enc_regs' array is an array of dcn10_stream_enc_registers
structures. The array is initialized with four elements, corresponding
to the four calls to stream_enc_regs() in the array initializer. This
means that valid indices for this array are 0, 1, 2, and 3.

The error message 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5 below, is indicating that
there is an attempt to access this array with an index of 5, which is
out of bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior

Here, eng_id is used as an index to access the stream_enc_regs array. If
eng_id is 5, this would result in an out-of-bounds access on the
stream_enc_regs array.

Thus fixing Buffer overflow error in dcn401_stream_encoder_create

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/resource/dcn401/dcn401_resource.c:1209 dcn401_stream_encoder_create() error: buffer overflow 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49970 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
