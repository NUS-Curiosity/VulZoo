Subject: CVE-2024-26665: tunnels: fix out of bounds access when building IPv6 PMTU error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tunnels: fix out of bounds access when building IPv6 PMTU error

If the ICMPv6 error is built from a non-linear skb we get the following
splat,

  BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in do_csum+0x220/0x240
  Read of size 4 at addr ffff88811d402c80 by task netperf/820
  CPU: 0 PID: 820 Comm: netperf Not tainted 6.8.0-rc1+ #543
  ...
   kasan_report+0xd8/0x110
   do_csum+0x220/0x240
   csum_partial+0xc/0x20
   skb_tunnel_check_pmtu+0xeb9/0x3280
   vxlan_xmit_one+0x14c2/0x4080

   __dev_queue_xmit+0x7cd/0x32a0
   br_dev_queue_push_xmit+0x39d/0x6a0

Use skb_checksum instead of csum_partial who cannot deal with non-linear
SKBs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26665 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
