Subject: CVE-2024-40901: scsi: mpt3sas: Avoid test/set_bit() operating in non-allocated memory

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpt3sas: Avoid test/set_bit() operating in non-allocated memory

There is a potential out-of-bounds access when using test_bit() on a single
word. The test_bit() and set_bit() functions operate on long values, and
when testing or setting a single word, they can exceed the word
boundary. KASAN detects this issue and produces a dump:

	 BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in _scsih_add_device.constprop.0 (./arch/x86/include/asm/bitops.h:60 ./include/asm-generic/bitops/instrumented-atomic.h:29 drivers/scsi/mpt3sas/mpt3sas_scsih.c:7331) mpt3sas

	 Write of size 8 at addr ffff8881d26e3c60 by task kworker/u1536:2/2965

For full log, please look at [1].

Make the allocation at least the size of sizeof(unsigned long) so that
set_bit() and test_bit() have sufficient room for read/write operations
without overwriting unallocated memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40901 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
