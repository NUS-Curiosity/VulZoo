Subject: CVE-2024-56558: nfsd: make sure exp active before svc_export_show

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: make sure exp active before svc_export_show

The function `e_show` was called with protection from RCU. This only
ensures that `exp` will not be freed. Therefore, the reference count for
`exp` can drop to zero, which will trigger a refcount use-after-free
warning when `exp_get` is called. To resolve this issue, use
`cache_get_rcu` to ensure that `exp` remains active.

------------[ cut here ]------------
refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
