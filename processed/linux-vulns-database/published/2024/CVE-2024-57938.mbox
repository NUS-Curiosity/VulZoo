Subject: CVE-2024-57938: net/sctp: Prevent autoclose integer overflow in sctp_association_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sctp: Prevent autoclose integer overflow in sctp_association_init()

While by default max_autoclose equals to INT_MAX / HZ, one may set
net.sctp.max_autoclose to UINT_MAX. There is code in
sctp_association_init() that can consequently trigger overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57938 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
