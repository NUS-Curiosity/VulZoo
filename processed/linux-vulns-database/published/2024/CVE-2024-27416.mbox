Subject: CVE-2024-27416: Bluetooth: hci_event: Fix handling of HCI_EV_IO_CAPA_REQUEST

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_event: Fix handling of HCI_EV_IO_CAPA_REQUEST

If we received HCI_EV_IO_CAPA_REQUEST while
HCI_OP_READ_REMOTE_EXT_FEATURES is yet to be responded assume the remote
does support SSP since otherwise this event shouldn't be generated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27416 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
