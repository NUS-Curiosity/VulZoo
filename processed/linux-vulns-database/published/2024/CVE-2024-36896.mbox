Subject: CVE-2024-36896: USB: core: Fix access violation during port device removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: core: Fix access violation during port device removal

Testing with KASAN and syzkaller revealed a bug in port.c:disable_store():
usb_hub_to_struct_hub() can return NULL if the hub that the port belongs to
is concurrently removed, but the function does not check for this
possibility before dereferencing the returned value.

It turns out that the first dereference is unnecessary, since hub->intfdev
is the parent of the port device, so it can be changed easily.  Adding a
check for hub == NULL prevents further problems.

The same bug exists in the disable_show() routine, and it can be fixed the
same way.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36896 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
