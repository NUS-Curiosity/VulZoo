Subject: CVE-2024-42078: nfsd: initialise nfsd_info.mutex early.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: initialise nfsd_info.mutex early.

nfsd_info.mutex can be dereferenced by svc_pool_stats_start()
immediately after the new netns is created.  Currently this can
trigger an oops.

Move the initialisation earlier before it can possibly be dereferenced.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42078 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7e8b94045bc77ce4f085ddfb9eb04e5760e66169
