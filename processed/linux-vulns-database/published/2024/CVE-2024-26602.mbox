Subject: CVE-2024-26602: sched/membarrier: reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/membarrier: reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier

On some systems, sys_membarrier can be very expensive, causing overall
slowdowns for everything.  So put a lock on the path in order to
serialize the accesses to prevent the ability for this to be called at
too high of a frequency and saturate the machine.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26602 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
