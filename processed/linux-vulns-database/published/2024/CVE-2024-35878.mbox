Subject: CVE-2024-35878: of: module: prevent NULL pointer dereference in vsnprintf()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

of: module: prevent NULL pointer dereference in vsnprintf()

In of_modalias(), we can get passed the str and len parameters which would
cause a kernel oops in vsnprintf() since it only allows passing a NULL ptr
when the length is also 0. Also, we need to filter out the negative values
of the len parameter as these will result in a really huge buffer since
snprintf() takes size_t parameter while ours is ssize_t...

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the Svace static
analysis tool.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35878 to this issue.

===========================

	Fixed in 6.6.26 with commit e4a449368a2c
	Fixed in 6.8.5 with commit 544561dc56f7

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
