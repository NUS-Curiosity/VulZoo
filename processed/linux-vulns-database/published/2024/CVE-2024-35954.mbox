Subject: CVE-2024-35954: scsi: sg: Avoid sg device teardown race

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: sg: Avoid sg device teardown race

sg_remove_sfp_usercontext() must not use sg_device_destroy() after calling
scsi_device_put().

sg_device_destroy() is accessing the parent scsi_device request_queue which
will already be set to NULL when the preceding call to scsi_device_put()
removed the last reference to the parent scsi_device.

The resulting NULL pointer exception will then crash the kernel.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35954 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
