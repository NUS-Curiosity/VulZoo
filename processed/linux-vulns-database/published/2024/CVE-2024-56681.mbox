Subject: CVE-2024-56681: crypto: bcm - add error check in the ahash_hmac_init function

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: bcm - add error check in the ahash_hmac_init function

The ahash_init functions may return fails. The ahash_hmac_init should
not return ok when ahash_init returns error. For an example, ahash_init
will return -ENOMEM when allocation memory is error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56681 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
