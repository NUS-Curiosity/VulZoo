Subject: CVE-2024-49988: ksmbd: add refcnt to ksmbd_conn struct

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: add refcnt to ksmbd_conn struct

When sending an oplock break request, opinfo->conn is used,
But freed ->conn can be used on multichannel.
This patch add a reference count to the ksmbd_conn struct
so that it can be freed when it is no longer used.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49988 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
