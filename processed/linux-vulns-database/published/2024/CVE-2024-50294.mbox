Subject: CVE-2024-50294: rxrpc: Fix missing locking causing hanging calls

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Fix missing locking causing hanging calls

If a call gets aborted (e.g. because kafs saw a signal) between it being
queued for connection and the I/O thread picking up the call, the abort
will be prioritised over the connection and it will be removed from
local->new_client_calls by rxrpc_disconnect_client_call() without a lock
being held.  This may cause other calls on the list to disappear if a race
occurs.

Fix this by taking the client_call_lock when removing a call from whatever
list its ->wait_link happens to be on.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50294 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
