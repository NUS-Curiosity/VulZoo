Subject: CVE-2024-35790: usb: typec: altmodes/displayport: create sysfs nodes as driver's default device attribute group

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: altmodes/displayport: create sysfs nodes as driver's default device attribute group

The DisplayPort driver's sysfs nodes may be present to the userspace before
typec_altmode_set_drvdata() completes in dp_altmode_probe. This means that
a sysfs read can trigger a NULL pointer error by deferencing dp->hpd in
hpd_show or dp->lock in pin_assignment_show, as dev_get_drvdata() returns
NULL in those cases.

Remove manual sysfs node creation in favor of adding attribute group as
default for devices bound to the driver. The ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS() macro is
not used here otherwise the path to the sysfs nodes is no longer compliant
with the ABI.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35790 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
