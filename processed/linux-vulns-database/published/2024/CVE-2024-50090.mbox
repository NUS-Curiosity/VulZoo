Subject: CVE-2024-50090: drm/xe/oa: Fix overflow in oa batch buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/oa: Fix overflow in oa batch buffer

By default xe_bb_create_job() appends a MI_BATCH_BUFFER_END to batch
buffer, this is not a problem if batch buffer is only used once but
oa reuses the batch buffer for the same metric and at each call
it appends a MI_BATCH_BUFFER_END, printing the warning below and then
overflowing.

[  381.072016] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[  381.072019] xe 0000:00:02.0: [drm] Assertion `bb->len * 4 + bb_prefetch(q->gt) <= size` failed!
               platform: LUNARLAKE subplatform: 1
               graphics: Xe2_LPG / Xe2_HPG 20.04 step B0
               media: Xe2_LPM / Xe2_HPM 20.00 step B0
               tile: 0 VRAM 0 B
               GT: 0 type 1

So here checking if batch buffer already have MI_BATCH_BUFFER_END if
not append it.

v2:
- simply fix, suggestion from Ashutosh

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bcb5be3421705e682b0b32073ad627056d6bc2a2
