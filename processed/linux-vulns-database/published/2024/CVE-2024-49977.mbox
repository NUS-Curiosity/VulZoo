Subject: CVE-2024-49977: net: stmmac: Fix zero-division error when disabling tc cbs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: Fix zero-division error when disabling tc cbs

The commit b8c43360f6e4 ("net: stmmac: No need to calculate speed divider
when offload is disabled") allows the "port_transmit_rate_kbps" to be
set to a value of 0, which is then passed to the "div_s64" function when
tc-cbs is disabled. This leads to a zero-division error.

When tc-cbs is disabled, the idleslope, sendslope, and credit values the
credit values are not required to be configured. Therefore, adding a return
statement after setting the txQ mode to DCB when tc-cbs is disabled would
prevent a zero-division error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49977 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
