Subject: CVE-2024-50144: drm/xe: fix unbalanced rpm put() with fence_fini()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: fix unbalanced rpm put() with fence_fini()

Currently we can call fence_fini() twice if something goes wrong when
sending the GuC CT for the tlb request, since we signal the fence and
return an error, leading to the caller also calling fini() on the error
path in the case of stack version of the flow, which leads to an extra
rpm put() which might later cause device to enter suspend when it
shouldn't. It looks like we can just drop the fini() call since the
fence signaller side will already call this for us.

There are known mysterious splats with device going to sleep even with
an rpm ref, and this could be one candidate.

v2 (Matt B):
  - Prefer warning if we detect double fini()

(cherry picked from commit cfcbc0520d5055825f0647ab922b655688605183)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50144 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
