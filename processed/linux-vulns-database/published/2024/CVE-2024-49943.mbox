Subject: CVE-2024-49943: drm/xe/guc_submit: add missing locking in wedged_fini

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/guc_submit: add missing locking in wedged_fini

Any non-wedged queue can have a zero refcount here and can be running
concurrently with an async queue destroy, therefore dereferencing the
queue ptr to check wedge status after the lookup can trigger UAF if
queue is not wedged.  Fix this by keeping the submission_state lock held
around the check to postpone the free and make the check safe, before
dropping again around the put() to avoid the deadlock.

(cherry picked from commit d28af0b6b9580b9f90c265a7da0315b0ad20bbfd)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49943 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d88f9bab7e62dd0dbe983fa70cf040042a60cc84
