Subject: CVE-2024-49874: i3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i3c: master: svc: Fix use after free vulnerability in svc_i3c_master Driver Due to Race Condition

In the svc_i3c_master_probe function, &master->hj_work is bound with
svc_i3c_master_hj_work, &master->ibi_work is bound with
svc_i3c_master_ibi_work. And svc_i3c_master_ibi_work  can start the
hj_work, svc_i3c_master_irq_handler can start the ibi_work.

If we remove the module which will call svc_i3c_master_remove to
make cleanup, it will free master->base through i3c_master_unregister
while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations
that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

CPU0                                         CPU1

                                    | svc_i3c_master_hj_work
svc_i3c_master_remove               |
i3c_master_unregister(&master->base)|
device_unregister(&master->dev)     |
device_release                      |
//free master->base                 |
                                    | i3c_master_do_daa(&master->base)
                                    | //use master->base

Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with the
cleanup in svc_i3c_master_remove.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49874 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
