Subject: CVE-2024-46800: sch/netem: fix use after free in netem_dequeue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sch/netem: fix use after free in netem_dequeue

If netem_dequeue() enqueues packet to inner qdisc and that qdisc
returns __NET_XMIT_STOLEN. The packet is dropped but
qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() is not called to update the parent's
q.qlen, leading to the similar use-after-free as Commit
e04991a48dbaf382 ("netem: fix return value if duplicate enqueue
fails")

Commands to trigger KASAN UaF:

ip link add type dummy
ip link set lo up
ip link set dummy0 up
tc qdisc add dev lo parent root handle 1: drr
tc filter add dev lo parent 1: basic classid 1:1
tc class add dev lo classid 1:1 drr
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2: netem
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 2: handle 3: drr
tc filter add dev lo parent 3: basic classid 3:1 action mirred egress
redirect dev dummy0
tc class add dev lo classid 3:1 drr
ping -c1 -W0.01 localhost # Trigger bug
tc class del dev lo classid 1:1
tc class add dev lo classid 1:1 drr
ping -c1 -W0.01 localhost # UaF

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46800 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
