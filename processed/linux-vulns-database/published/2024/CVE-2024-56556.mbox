Subject: CVE-2024-56556: binder: fix node UAF in binder_add_freeze_work()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: fix node UAF in binder_add_freeze_work()

In binder_add_freeze_work() we iterate over the proc->nodes with the
proc->inner_lock held. However, this lock is temporarily dropped in
order to acquire the node->lock first (lock nesting order). This can
race with binder_node_release() and trigger a use-after-free:

  ==================================================================

Fix the race by taking a temporary reference on the node before
releasing the proc->inner lock. This ensures the node remains alive
while in use.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56556 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/38fbefeb2c140b581ed7de8117a5c90d6dd89c22
