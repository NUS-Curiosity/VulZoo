Subject: CVE-2024-43820: dm-raid: Fix WARN_ON_ONCE check for sync_thread in raid_resume

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-raid: Fix WARN_ON_ONCE check for sync_thread in raid_resume

rm-raid devices will occasionally trigger the following warning when
being resumed after a table load because DM_RECOVERY_RUNNING is set:

WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 5660 at drivers/md/dm-raid.c:4105 raid_resume+0xee/0x100 [dm_raid]

The failing check is:
WARN_ON_ONCE(test_bit(MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING, &mddev->recovery));

This check is designed to make sure that the sync thread isn't
registered, but md_check_recovery can set MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING without
the sync_thread ever getting registered. Instead of checking if
MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING is set, check if sync_thread is non-NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43820 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a5c15a78c0e1631b7df822b56e8b6424e4d1ca3e
