Subject: CVE-2024-50287: media: v4l2-tpg: prevent the risk of a division by zero

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: v4l2-tpg: prevent the risk of a division by zero

As reported by Coverity, the logic at tpg_precalculate_line()
blindly rescales the buffer even when scaled_witdh is equal to
zero. If this ever happens, this will cause a division by zero.

Instead, add a WARN_ON_ONCE() to trigger such cases and return
without doing any precalculation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50287 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
