Subject: CVE-2024-46737: nvmet-tcp: fix kernel crash if commands allocation fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet-tcp: fix kernel crash if commands allocation fails

If the commands allocation fails in nvmet_tcp_alloc_cmds()
the kernel crashes in nvmet_tcp_release_queue_work() because of
a NULL pointer dereference.

  nvmet: failed to install queue 0 cntlid 1 ret 6
  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at
         virtual address 0000000000000008

Fix the bug by setting queue->nr_cmds to zero in case
nvmet_tcp_alloc_cmd() fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46737 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
