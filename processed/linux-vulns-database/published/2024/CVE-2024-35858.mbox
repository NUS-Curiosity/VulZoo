Subject: CVE-2024-35858: net: bcmasp: fix memory leak when bringing down interface

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bcmasp: fix memory leak when bringing down interface

When bringing down the TX rings we flush the rings but forget to
reclaimed the flushed packets. This leads to a memory leak since we
do not free the dma mapped buffers. This also leads to tx control
block corruption when bringing down the interface for power
management.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35858 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
