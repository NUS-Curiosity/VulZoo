Subject: CVE-2024-41081: ila: block BH in ila_output()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ila: block BH in ila_output()

As explained in commit 1378817486d6 ("tipc: block BH
before using dst_cache"), net/core/dst_cache.c
helpers need to be called with BH disabled.

ila_output() is called from lwtunnel_output()
possibly from process context, and under rcu_read_lock().

We might be interrupted by a softirq, re-enter ila_output()
and corrupt dst_cache data structures.

Fix the race by using local_bh_disable().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41081 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
