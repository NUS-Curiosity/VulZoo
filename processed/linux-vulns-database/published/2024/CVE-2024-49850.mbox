Subject: CVE-2024-49850: bpf: correctly handle malformed BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL relos

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: correctly handle malformed BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL relos

In case of malformed relocation record of kind BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL
referencing a non-existing BTF type, function bpf_core_calc_relo_insn
would cause a null pointer deference.

Fix this by adding a proper check upper in call stack, as malformed
relocation records could be passed from user space.

Simplest reproducer is a program:

    r0 = 0
    exit

With a single relocation record:

    .insn_off = 0,          /* patch first instruction */
    .type_id = 100500,      /* this type id does not exist */
    .access_str_off = 6,    /* offset of string "0" */
    .kind = BPF_CORE_TYPE_ID_LOCAL,

See the link for original reproducer or next commit for a test case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49850 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
