Subject: CVE-2024-49930: wifi: ath11k: fix array out-of-bound access in SoC stats

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: fix array out-of-bound access in SoC stats

Currently, the ath11k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error array is defined with a
maximum size of DP_REO_DST_RING_MAX. However, the ath11k_dp_process_rx()
function access ath11k_soc_dp_stats::hal_reo_error using the REO
destination SRNG ring ID, which is incorrect. SRNG ring ID differ from
normal ring ID, and this usage leads to out-of-bounds array access. To fix
this issue, modify ath11k_dp_process_rx() to use the normal ring ID
directly instead of the SRNG ring ID to avoid out-of-bounds array access.

Tested-on: QCN9074 hw1.0 PCI WLAN.HK.2.7.0.1-01744-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49930 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
