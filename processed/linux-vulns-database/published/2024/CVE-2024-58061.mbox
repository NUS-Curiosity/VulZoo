Subject: CVE-2024-58061: wifi: mac80211: prohibit deactivating all links

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: prohibit deactivating all links

In the internal API this calls this is a WARN_ON, but that
should remain since internally we want to know about bugs
that may cause this. Prevent deactivating all links in the
debugfs write directly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58061 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
