Subject: CVE-2024-42268: net/mlx5: Fix missing lock on sync reset reload

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix missing lock on sync reset reload

On sync reset reload work, when remote host updates devlink on reload
actions performed on that host, it misses taking devlink lock before
calling devlink_remote_reload_actions_performed() which results in
triggering lock assert like the following:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
