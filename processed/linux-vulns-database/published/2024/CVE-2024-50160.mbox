Subject: CVE-2024-50160: ALSA: hda/cs8409: Fix possible NULL dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda/cs8409: Fix possible NULL dereference

If snd_hda_gen_add_kctl fails to allocate memory and returns NULL, then
NULL pointer dereference will occur in the next line.

Since dolphin_fixups function is a hda_fixup function which is not supposed
to return any errors, add simple check before dereference, ignore the fail.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50160 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
