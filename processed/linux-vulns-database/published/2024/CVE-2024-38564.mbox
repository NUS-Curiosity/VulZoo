Subject: CVE-2024-38564: bpf: Add BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB attach type enforcement in BPF_LINK_CREATE

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Add BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB attach type enforcement in BPF_LINK_CREATE

bpf_prog_attach uses attach_type_to_prog_type to enforce proper
attach type for BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SKB. link_create uses
bpf_prog_get and relies on bpf_prog_attach_check_attach_type
to properly verify prog_type <> attach_type association.

Add missing attach_type enforcement for the link_create case.
Otherwise, it's currently possible to attach cgroup_skb prog
types to other cgroup hooks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38564 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
