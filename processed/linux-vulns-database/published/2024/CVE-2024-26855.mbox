Subject: CVE-2024-26855: net: ice: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in ice_bridge_setlink()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ice: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in ice_bridge_setlink()

The function ice_bridge_setlink() may encounter a NULL pointer dereference
if nlmsg_find_attr() returns NULL and br_spec is dereferenced subsequently
in nla_for_each_nested(). To address this issue, add a check to ensure that
br_spec is not NULL before proceeding with the nested attribute iteration.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26855 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
