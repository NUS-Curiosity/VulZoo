Subject: CVE-2024-40970: Avoid hw_desc array overrun in dw-axi-dmac

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Avoid hw_desc array overrun in dw-axi-dmac

I have a use case where nr_buffers = 3 and in which each descriptor is composed by 3
segments, resulting in the DMA channel descs_allocated to be 9. Since axi_desc_put()
handles the hw_desc considering the descs_allocated, this scenario would result in a
kernel panic (hw_desc array will be overrun).

To fix this, the proposal is to add a new member to the axi_dma_desc structure,
where we keep the number of allocated hw_descs (axi_desc_alloc()) and use it in
axi_desc_put() to handle the hw_desc array correctly.

Additionally I propose to remove the axi_chan_start_first_queued() call after completing
the transfer, since it was identified that unbalance can occur (started descriptors can
be interrupted and transfer ignored due to DMA channel not being enabled).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40970 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
