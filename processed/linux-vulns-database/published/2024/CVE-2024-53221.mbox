Subject: CVE-2024-53221: f2fs: fix null-ptr-deref in f2fs_submit_page_bio()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix null-ptr-deref in f2fs_submit_page_bio()

There's issue as follows when concurrently installing the f2fs.ko
module and mounting the f2fs file system:
KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000020-0x0000000000000027]
RIP: 0010:__bio_alloc+0x2fb/0x6c0 [f2fs]
Call Trace:

Above issue happens as the biset of the f2fs file system is not
initialized before register "f2fs_fs_type".
To address above issue just register "f2fs_fs_type" at the last in
init_f2fs_fs(). Ensure that all f2fs file system resources are
initialized.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53221 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
