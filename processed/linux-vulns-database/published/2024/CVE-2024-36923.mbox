Subject: CVE-2024-36923: fs/9p: fix uninitialized values during inode evict

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/9p: fix uninitialized values during inode evict

If an iget fails due to not being able to retrieve information
from the server then the inode structure is only partially
initialized.  When the inode gets evicted, references to
uninitialized structures (like fscache cookies) were being
made.

This patch checks for a bad_inode before doing anything other
than clearing the inode from the cache.  Since the inode is
bad, it shouldn't have any state associated with it that needs
to be written back (and there really isn't a way to complete
those anyways).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36923 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
