Subject: CVE-2024-47408: net/smc: check smcd_v2_ext_offset when receiving proposal msg

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: check smcd_v2_ext_offset when receiving proposal msg

When receiving proposal msg in server, the field smcd_v2_ext_offset in
proposal msg is from the remote client and can not be fully trusted.
Once the value of smcd_v2_ext_offset exceed the max value, there has
the chance to access wrong address, and crash may happen.

This patch checks the value of smcd_v2_ext_offset before using it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47408 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
