Subject: CVE-2024-46794: x86/tdx: Fix data leak in mmio_read()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/tdx: Fix data leak in mmio_read()

The mmio_read() function makes a TDVMCALL to retrieve MMIO data for an
address from the VMM.

Sean noticed that mmio_read() unintentionally exposes the value of an
initialized variable (val) on the stack to the VMM.

This variable is only needed as an output value. It did not need to be
passed to the VMM in the first place.

Do not send the original value of *val to the VMM.

[ dhansen: clarify what 'val' is used for. ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46794 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
