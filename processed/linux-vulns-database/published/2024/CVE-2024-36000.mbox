Subject: CVE-2024-36000: mm/hugetlb: fix missing hugetlb_lock for resv uncharge

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: fix missing hugetlb_lock for resv uncharge

There is a recent report on UFFDIO_COPY over hugetlb:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/000000000000ee06de0616177560@google.com/

350:	lockdep_assert_held(&hugetlb_lock);

Should be an issue in hugetlb but triggered in an userfault context, where
it goes into the unlikely path where two threads modifying the resv map
together.  Mike has a fix in that path for resv uncharge but it looks like
the locking criteria was overlooked: hugetlb_cgroup_uncharge_folio_rsvd()
will update the cgroup pointer, so it requires to be called with the lock
held.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36000 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
