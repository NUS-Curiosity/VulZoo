Subject: CVE-2024-47686: ep93xx: clock: Fix off by one in ep93xx_div_recalc_rate()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ep93xx: clock: Fix off by one in ep93xx_div_recalc_rate()

The psc->div[] array has psc->num_div elements.  These values come from
when we call clk_hw_register_div().  It's adc_divisors and
ARRAY_SIZE(adc_divisors)) and so on.  So this condition needs to be >=
instead of > to prevent an out of bounds read.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47686 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
