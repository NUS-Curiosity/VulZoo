Subject: CVE-2024-50260: sock_map: fix a NULL pointer dereference in sock_map_link_update_prog()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sock_map: fix a NULL pointer dereference in sock_map_link_update_prog()

The following race condition could trigger a NULL pointer dereference:

sock_map_link_detach():		sock_map_link_update_prog():
   mutex_lock(&sockmap_mutex);
   ...
   sockmap_link->map = NULL;
   mutex_unlock(&sockmap_mutex);
   				   mutex_lock(&sockmap_mutex);
				   ...
				   sock_map_prog_link_lookup(sockmap_link->map);
				   mutex_unlock(&sockmap_mutex);
   <continue>

Fix it by adding a NULL pointer check. In this specific case, it makes
no sense to update a link which is being released.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50260 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9afe35fdda16e09d5bd3c49a68ba8c680dd678bd
