Subject: CVE-2024-42143: orangefs: fix out-of-bounds fsid access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

orangefs: fix out-of-bounds fsid access

Arnd Bergmann sent a patch to fsdevel, he says:

"orangefs_statfs() copies two consecutive fields of the superblock into
the statfs structure, which triggers a warning from the string fortification
helpers"

Jan Kara suggested an alternate way to do the patch to make it more readable.

I ran both ideas through xfstests and both seem fine. This patch
is based on Jan Kara's suggestion.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42143 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
