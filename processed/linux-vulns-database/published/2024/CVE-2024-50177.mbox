Subject: CVE-2024-50177: drm/amd/display: fix a UBSAN warning in DML2.1

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: fix a UBSAN warning in DML2.1

When programming phantom pipe, since cursor_width is explicity set to 0,
this causes calculation logic to trigger overflow for an unsigned int
triggering the kernel's UBSAN check as below:

[   40.962845] UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in /tmp/amd.EfpumTkO/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dml2/dml21/src/dml2_core/dml2_core_dcn4_calcs.c:3312:34

Fix this by adding a guard for checking cursor width before triggering
the size calculation.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/27bc3da5eae57e3af8f5648b4498ffde48781434
