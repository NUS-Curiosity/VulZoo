Subject: CVE-2024-56531: ALSA: caiaq: Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnection

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: caiaq: Use snd_card_free_when_closed() at disconnection

The USB disconnect callback is supposed to be short and not too-long
waiting.  OTOH, the current code uses snd_card_free() at
disconnection, but this waits for the close of all used fds, hence it
can take long.  It eventually blocks the upper layer USB ioctls, which
may trigger a soft lockup.

An easy workaround is to replace snd_card_free() with
snd_card_free_when_closed().  This variant returns immediately while
the release of resources is done asynchronously by the card device
release at the last close.

This patch also splits the code to the disconnect and the free phases;
the former is called immediately at the USB disconnect callback while
the latter is called from the card destructor.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56531 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
