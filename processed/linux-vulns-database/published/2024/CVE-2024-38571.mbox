Subject: CVE-2024-38571: thermal/drivers/tsens: Fix null pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal/drivers/tsens: Fix null pointer dereference

compute_intercept_slope() is called from calibrate_8960() (in tsens-8960.c)
as compute_intercept_slope(priv, p1, NULL, ONE_PT_CALIB) which lead to null
pointer dereference (if DEBUG or DYNAMIC_DEBUG set).
Fix this bug by adding null pointer check.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38571 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
