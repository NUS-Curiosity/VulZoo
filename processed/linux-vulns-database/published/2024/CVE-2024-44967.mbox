Subject: CVE-2024-44967: drm/mgag200: Bind I2C lifetime to DRM device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mgag200: Bind I2C lifetime to DRM device

Managed cleanup with devm_add_action_or_reset() will release the I2C
adapter when the underlying Linux device goes away. But the connector
still refers to it, so this cleanup leaves behind a stale pointer
in struct drm_connector.ddc.

Bind the lifetime of the I2C adapter to the connector's lifetime by
using DRM's managed release. When the DRM device goes away (after
the Linux device) DRM will first clean up the connector and then
clean up the I2C adapter.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44967 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
