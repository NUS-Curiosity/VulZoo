Subject: CVE-2024-47746: fuse: use exclusive lock when FUSE_I_CACHE_IO_MODE is set

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fuse: use exclusive lock when FUSE_I_CACHE_IO_MODE is set

This may be a typo. The comment has said shared locks are
not allowed when this bit is set. If using shared lock, the
wait in `fuse_file_cached_io_open` may be forever.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47746 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
