Subject: CVE-2024-57981: usb: xhci: Fix NULL pointer dereference on certain command aborts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Fix NULL pointer dereference on certain command aborts

If a command is queued to the final usable TRB of a ring segment, the
enqueue pointer is advanced to the subsequent link TRB and no further.
If the command is later aborted, when the abort completion is handled
the dequeue pointer is advanced to the first TRB of the next segment.

If no further commands are queued, xhci_handle_stopped_cmd_ring() sees
the ring pointers unequal and assumes that there is a pending command,
so it calls xhci_mod_cmd_timer() which crashes if cur_cmd was NULL.

Don't attempt timer setup if cur_cmd is NULL. The subsequent doorbell
ring likely is unnecessary too, but it's harmless. Leave it alone.

This is probably Bug 219532, but no confirmation has been received.

The issue has been independently reproduced and confirmed fixed using
a USB MCU programmed to NAK the Status stage of SET_ADDRESS forever.
Everything continued working normally after several prevented crashes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57981 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
