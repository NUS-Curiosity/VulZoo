Subject: CVE-2024-46741: misc: fastrpc: Fix double free of 'buf' in error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: fastrpc: Fix double free of 'buf' in error path

smatch warning:
drivers/misc/fastrpc.c:1926 fastrpc_req_mmap() error: double free of 'buf'

In fastrpc_req_mmap() error path, the fastrpc buffer is freed in
fastrpc_req_munmap_impl() if unmap is successful.

But in the end, there is an unconditional call to fastrpc_buf_free().
So the above case triggers the double free of fastrpc buf.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46741 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
