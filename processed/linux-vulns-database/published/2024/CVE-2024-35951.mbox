Subject: CVE-2024-35951: drm/panfrost: Fix the error path in panfrost_mmu_map_fault_addr()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panfrost: Fix the error path in panfrost_mmu_map_fault_addr()

Subject: [PATCH] drm/panfrost: Fix the error path in
 panfrost_mmu_map_fault_addr()

If some the pages or sgt allocation failed, we shouldn't release the
pages ref we got earlier, otherwise we will end up with unbalanced
get/put_pages() calls. We should instead leave everything in place
and let the BO release function deal with extra cleanup when the object
is destroyed, or let the fault handler try again next time it's called.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35951 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
