Subject: CVE-2024-36025: scsi: qla2xxx: Fix off by one in qla_edif_app_getstats()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix off by one in qla_edif_app_getstats()

The app_reply->elem[] array is allocated earlier in this function and it
has app_req.num_ports elements.  Thus this > comparison needs to be >= to
prevent memory corruption.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36025 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
