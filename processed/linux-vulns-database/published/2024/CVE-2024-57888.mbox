Subject: CVE-2024-57888: workqueue: Do not warn when cancelling WQ_MEM_RECLAIM work from !WQ_MEM_RECLAIM worker

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

workqueue: Do not warn when cancelling WQ_MEM_RECLAIM work from !WQ_MEM_RECLAIM worker

After commit
746ae46c1113 ("drm/sched: Mark scheduler work queues with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM")
amdgpu started seeing the following warning:

 [ ] workqueue: WQ_MEM_RECLAIM sdma0:drm_sched_run_job_work [gpu_sched] is flushing !WQ_MEM_RECLAIM events:amdgpu_device_delay_enable_gfx_off [amdgpu]

The intent of the verifcation done in check_flush_depedency is to ensure
forward progress during memory reclaim, by flagging cases when either a
memory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a
context not marked as memory reclaim safe.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the
cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is
either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore
cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the
helper know of the calling context.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1fd2a57dcb4de3cb40844a29c71b5d7b46a84334
