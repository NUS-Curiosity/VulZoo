Subject: CVE-2024-47677: exfat: resolve memory leak from exfat_create_upcase_table()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

exfat: resolve memory leak from exfat_create_upcase_table()

If exfat_load_upcase_table reaches end and returns -EINVAL,
allocated memory doesn't get freed and while
exfat_load_default_upcase_table allocates more memory, leading to a
memory leak.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
