Subject: CVE-2024-53197: ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential out-of-bound accesses for Extigy and Mbox devices

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix potential out-of-bound accesses for Extigy and Mbox devices

A bogus device can provide a bNumConfigurations value that exceeds the
initial value used in usb_get_configuration for allocating dev->config.

This can lead to out-of-bounds accesses later, e.g. in
usb_destroy_configuration.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53197 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
