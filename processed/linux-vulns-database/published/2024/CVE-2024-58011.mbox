Subject: CVE-2024-58011: platform/x86: int3472: Check for adev == NULL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: int3472: Check for adev == NULL

Not all devices have an ACPI companion fwnode, so adev might be NULL. This
can e.g. (theoretically) happen when a user manually binds one of
the int3472 drivers to another i2c/platform device through sysfs.

Add a check for adev not being set and return -ENODEV in that case to
avoid a possible NULL pointer deref in skl_int3472_get_acpi_buffer().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58011 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
