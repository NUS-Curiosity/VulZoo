Subject: CVE-2024-49955: ACPI: battery: Fix possible crash when unregistering a battery hook

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: battery: Fix possible crash when unregistering a battery hook

When a battery hook returns an error when adding a new battery, then
the battery hook is automatically unregistered.
However the battery hook provider cannot know that, so it will later
call battery_hook_unregister() on the already unregistered battery
hook, resulting in a crash.

Fix this by using the list head to mark already unregistered battery
hooks as already being unregistered so that they can be ignored by
battery_hook_unregister().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49955 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
