Subject: CVE-2024-35887: ax25: fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ax25: fix use-after-free bugs caused by ax25_ds_del_timer

When the ax25 device is detaching, the ax25_dev_device_down()
calls ax25_ds_del_timer() to cleanup the slave_timer. When
the timer handler is running, the ax25_ds_del_timer() that
calls del_timer() in it will return directly. As a result,
the use-after-free bugs could happen, one of the scenarios
is shown below:

      (Thread 1)          |      (Thread 2)
                          | ax25_ds_timeout()
ax25_dev_device_down()    |
  ax25_ds_del_timer()     |
    del_timer()           |
  ax25_dev_put() //FREE   |
                          |  ax25_dev-> //USE

In order to mitigate bugs, when the device is detaching, use
timer_shutdown_sync() to stop the timer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35887 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/74204bf9050f7627aead9875fe4e07ba125cb19b
