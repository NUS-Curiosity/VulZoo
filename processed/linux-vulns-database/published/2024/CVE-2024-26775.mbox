Subject: CVE-2024-26775: aoe: avoid potential deadlock at set_capacity

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aoe: avoid potential deadlock at set_capacity

Move set_capacity() outside of the section procected by (&d->lock).
To avoid possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario:

        CPU0                    CPU1
        ----                    ----
[1] lock(&bdev->bd_size_lock);
                                local_irq_disable();
                            [2] lock(&d->lock);
                            [3] lock(&bdev->bd_size_lock);
   <Interrupt>
[4]  lock(&d->lock);

  *** DEADLOCK ***

Where [1](&bdev->bd_size_lock) hold by zram_add()->set_capacity().
[2]lock(&d->lock) hold by aoeblk_gdalloc(). And aoeblk_gdalloc()
is trying to acquire [3](&bdev->bd_size_lock) at set_capacity() call.
In this situation an attempt to acquire [4]lock(&d->lock) from
aoecmd_cfg_rsp() will lead to deadlock.

So the simplest solution is breaking lock dependency
[2](&d->lock) -> [3](&bdev->bd_size_lock) by moving set_capacity()
outside.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26775 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
