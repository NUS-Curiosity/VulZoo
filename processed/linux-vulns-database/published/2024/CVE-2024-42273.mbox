Subject: CVE-2024-42273: f2fs: assign CURSEG_ALL_DATA_ATGC if blkaddr is valid

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: assign CURSEG_ALL_DATA_ATGC if blkaddr is valid

mkdir /mnt/test/comp
f2fs_io setflags compression /mnt/test/comp
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/test/comp/testfile bs=16k count=1
truncate --size 13 /mnt/test/comp/testfile

In the above scenario, we can get a BUG_ON.
 kernel BUG at fs/f2fs/segment.c:3589!
 Call Trace:

  wb_writeback+0x192/0x310
  wb_workfn+0x30d/0x400

The reason is we gave CURSEG_ALL_DATA_ATGC to COMPR_ADDR where the
page was set the gcing flag by set_cluster_dirty().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42273 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
