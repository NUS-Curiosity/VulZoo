Subject: CVE-2024-44973: mm, slub: do not call do_slab_free for kfence object

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm, slub: do not call do_slab_free for kfence object

In 782f8906f805 the freeing of kfence objects was moved from deep
inside do_slab_free to the wrapper functions outside. This is a nice
change, but unfortunately it missed one spot in __kmem_cache_free_bulk.

This results in a crash like this:

BUG skbuff_head_cache (Tainted: G S  B       E     ): Padding overwritten. 0xffff88907fea0f00-0xffff88907fea0fff @offset=3840

slab_err (mm/slub.c:1129)
free_to_partial_list (mm/slub.c:? mm/slub.c:4036)
slab_pad_check (mm/slub.c:864 mm/slub.c:1290)
check_slab (mm/slub.c:?)
free_to_partial_list (mm/slub.c:3171 mm/slub.c:4036)
kmem_cache_alloc_bulk (mm/slub.c:? mm/slub.c:4495 mm/slub.c:4586 mm/slub.c:4635)
napi_build_skb (net/core/skbuff.c:348 net/core/skbuff.c:527 net/core/skbuff.c:549)

All the other callers to do_slab_free appear to be ok.

Add a kfence_free check in __kmem_cache_free_bulk to avoid the crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44973 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b35cd7f1e969aaa63e6716d82480f6b8a3230949
