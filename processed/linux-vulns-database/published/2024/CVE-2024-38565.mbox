Subject: CVE-2024-38565: wifi: ar5523: enable proper endpoint verification

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ar5523: enable proper endpoint verification

Syzkaller reports [1] hitting a warning about an endpoint in use
not having an expected type to it.

Fix the issue by checking for the existence of all proper
endpoints with their according types intact.

Sadly, this patch has not been tested on real hardware.

[1] Syzkaller report:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
