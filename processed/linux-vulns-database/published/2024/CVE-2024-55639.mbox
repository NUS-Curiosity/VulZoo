Subject: CVE-2024-55639: net: renesas: rswitch: avoid use-after-put for a device tree node

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: renesas: rswitch: avoid use-after-put for a device tree node

The device tree node saved in the rswitch_device structure is used at
several driver locations. So passing this node to of_node_put() after
the first use is wrong.

Move of_node_put() for this node to exit paths.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-55639 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
