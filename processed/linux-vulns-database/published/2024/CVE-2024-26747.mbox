Subject: CVE-2024-26747: usb: roles: fix NULL pointer issue when put module's reference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: roles: fix NULL pointer issue when put module's reference

In current design, usb role class driver will get usb_role_switch parent's
module reference after the user get usb_role_switch device and put the
reference after the user put the usb_role_switch device. However, the
parent device of usb_role_switch may be removed before the user put the
usb_role_switch. If so, then, NULL pointer issue will be met when the user
put the parent module's reference.

This will save the module pointer in structure of usb_role_switch. Then,
we don't need to find module by iterating long relations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26747 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
