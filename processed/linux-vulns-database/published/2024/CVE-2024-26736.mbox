Subject: CVE-2024-26736: afs: Increase buffer size in afs_update_volume_status()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

afs: Increase buffer size in afs_update_volume_status()

The max length of volume->vid value is 20 characters.
So increase idbuf[] size up to 24 to avoid overflow.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

[DH: Actually, it's 20 + NUL, so increase it to 24 and use snprintf()]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26736 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
