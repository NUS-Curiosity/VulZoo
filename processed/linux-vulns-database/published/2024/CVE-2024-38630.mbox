Subject: CVE-2024-38630: watchdog: cpu5wdt.c: Fix use-after-free bug caused by cpu5wdt_trigger

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

watchdog: cpu5wdt.c: Fix use-after-free bug caused by cpu5wdt_trigger

When the cpu5wdt module is removing, the origin code uses del_timer() to
de-activate the timer. If the timer handler is running, del_timer() could
not stop it and will return directly. If the port region is released by
release_region() and then the timer handler cpu5wdt_trigger() calls outb()
to write into the region that is released, the use-after-free bug will
happen.

Change del_timer() to timer_shutdown_sync() in order that the timer handler
could be finished before the port region is released.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38630 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
