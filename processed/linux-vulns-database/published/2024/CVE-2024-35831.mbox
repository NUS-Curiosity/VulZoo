Subject: CVE-2024-35831: io_uring: Fix release of pinned pages when __io_uaddr_map fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: Fix release of pinned pages when __io_uaddr_map fails

Looking at the error path of __io_uaddr_map, if we fail after pinning
the pages for any reasons, ret will be set to -EINVAL and the error
handler won't properly release the pinned pages.

I didn't manage to trigger it without forcing a failure, but it can
happen in real life when memory is heavily fragmented.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35831 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
