Subject: CVE-2024-56573: efi/libstub: Free correct pointer on failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi/libstub: Free correct pointer on failure

cmdline_ptr is an out parameter, which is not allocated by the function
itself, and likely points into the caller's stack.

cmdline refers to the pool allocation that should be freed when cleaning
up after a failure, so pass this instead to free_pool().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56573 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
