Subject: CVE-2024-44931: gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: prevent potential speculation leaks in gpio_device_get_desc()

Userspace may trigger a speculative read of an address outside the gpio
descriptor array.
Users can do that by calling gpio_ioctl() with an offset out of range.
Offset is copied from user and then used as an array index to get
the gpio descriptor without sanitization in gpio_device_get_desc().

This change ensures that the offset is sanitized by using
array_index_nospec() to mitigate any possibility of speculative
information leaks.

This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis
Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44931 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
