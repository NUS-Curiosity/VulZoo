Subject: CVE-2024-56545: HID: hyperv: streamline driver probe to avoid devres issues

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: hyperv: streamline driver probe to avoid devres issues

It was found that unloading 'hid_hyperv' module results in a devres
complaint:

 ...
 hv_vmbus: unregistering driver hid_hyperv
 ------------[ cut here ]------------
 WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 3983 at drivers/base/devres.c:691 devres_release_group+0x1f2/0x2c0

  ...

And the issue seems to be that the corresponding devres group is not
allocated. Normally, devres_open_group() is called from
__hid_device_probe() but Hyper-V HID driver overrides 'hid_dev->driver'
with 'mousevsc_hid_driver' stub and basically re-implements
__hid_device_probe() by calling hid_parse() and hid_hw_start() but not
devres_open_group(). hid_device_probe() does not call __hid_device_probe()
for it. Later, when the driver is removed, hid_device_remove() calls
devres_release_group() as it doesn't check whether hdev->driver was
initially overridden or not.

The issue seems to be related to the commit 62c68e7cee33 ("HID: ensure
timely release of driver-allocated resources") but the commit itself seems
to be correct.

Fix the issue by dropping the 'hid_dev->driver' override and using
hid_register_driver()/hid_unregister_driver() instead. Alternatively, it
would have been possible to rely on the default handling but
HID_CONNECT_DEFAULT implies HID_CONNECT_HIDRAW and it doesn't seem to work
for mousevsc as-is.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56545 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
