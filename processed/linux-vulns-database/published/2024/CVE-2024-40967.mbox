Subject: CVE-2024-40967: serial: imx: Introduce timeout when waiting on transmitter empty

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: imx: Introduce timeout when waiting on transmitter empty

By waiting at most 1 second for USR2_TXDC to be set, we avoid a potential
deadlock.

In case of the timeout, there is not much we can do, so we simply ignore
the transmitter state and optimistically try to continue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40967 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
