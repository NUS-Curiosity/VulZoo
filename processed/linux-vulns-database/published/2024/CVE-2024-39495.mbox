Subject: CVE-2024-39495: greybus: Fix use-after-free bug in gb_interface_release due to race condition.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

greybus: Fix use-after-free bug in gb_interface_release due to race condition.

In gb_interface_create, &intf->mode_switch_completion is bound with
gb_interface_mode_switch_work. Then it will be started by
gb_interface_request_mode_switch. Here is the relevant code.
if (!queue_work(system_long_wq, &intf->mode_switch_work)) {
	...
}

If we call gb_interface_release to make cleanup, there may be an
unfinished work. This function will call kfree to free the object
"intf". However, if gb_interface_mode_switch_work is scheduled to
run after kfree, it may cause use-after-free error as
gb_interface_mode_switch_work will use the object "intf".
The possible execution flow that may lead to the issue is as follows:

CPU0                            CPU1

                            |   gb_interface_create
                            |   gb_interface_request_mode_switch
gb_interface_release        |
kfree(intf) (free)          |
                            |   gb_interface_mode_switch_work
                            |   mutex_lock(&intf->mutex) (use)

Fix it by canceling the work before kfree.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39495 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
