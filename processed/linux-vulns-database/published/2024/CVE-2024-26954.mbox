Subject: CVE-2024-26954: ksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in smb_strndup_from_utf16()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in smb_strndup_from_utf16()

If ->NameOffset of smb2_create_req is smaller than Buffer offset of
smb2_create_req, slab-out-of-bounds read can happen from smb2_open.
This patch set the minimum value of the name offset to the buffer offset
to validate name length of smb2_create_req().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26954 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
