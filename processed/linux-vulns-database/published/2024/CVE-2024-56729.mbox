Subject: CVE-2024-56729: smb: Initialize cfid->tcon before performing network ops

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: Initialize cfid->tcon before performing network ops

Avoid leaking a tcon ref when a lease break races with opening the
cached directory. Processing the leak break might take a reference to
the tcon in cached_dir_lease_break() and then fail to release the ref in
cached_dir_offload_close, since cfid->tcon is still NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56729 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
