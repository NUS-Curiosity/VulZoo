Subject: CVE-2024-46707: KVM: arm64: Make ICC_*SGI*_EL1 undef in the absence of a vGICv3

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: Make ICC_*SGI*_EL1 undef in the absence of a vGICv3

On a system with a GICv3, if a guest hasn't been configured with
GICv3 and that the host is not capable of GICv2 emulation,
a write to any of the ICC_*SGI*_EL1 registers is trapped to EL2.

We therefore try to emulate the SGI access, only to hit a NULL
pointer as no private interrupt is allocated (no GIC, remember?).

The obvious fix is to give the guest what it deserves, in the
shape of a UNDEF exception.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46707 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
