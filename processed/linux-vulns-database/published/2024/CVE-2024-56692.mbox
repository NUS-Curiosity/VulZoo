Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to do sanity check on node blkaddr in truncate_node()

syzbot reports a f2fs bug as below:

The root cause is: on a fuzzed image, blkaddr in nat entry may be
corrupted, then it will cause system panic when using it in
f2fs_invalidate_blocks(), to avoid this, let's add sanity check on
nat blkaddr in truncate_node().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56692 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
