Subject: CVE-2024-26850: mm/debug_vm_pgtable: fix BUG_ON with pud advanced test

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/debug_vm_pgtable: fix BUG_ON with pud advanced test

Architectures like powerpc add debug checks to ensure we find only devmap
PUD pte entries.  These debug checks are only done with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM. 
This patch marks the ptes used for PUD advanced test devmap pte entries so
that we don't hit on debug checks on architecture like ppc64 as below.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
