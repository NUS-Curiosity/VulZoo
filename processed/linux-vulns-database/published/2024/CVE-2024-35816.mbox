Subject: CVE-2024-35816: firewire: ohci: prevent leak of left-over IRQ on unbind

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firewire: ohci: prevent leak of left-over IRQ on unbind

Commit 5a95f1ded28691e6 ("firewire: ohci: use devres for requested IRQ")
also removed the call to free_irq() in pci_remove(), leading to a
leftover irq of devm_request_irq() at pci_disable_msi() in pci_remove()
when unbinding the driver from the device

remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'irq/136', leaking at
least 'firewire_ohci'

remove irq with devm_free_irq() before pci_disable_msi()
also remove it in fail_msi: of pci_probe() as this would lead to
an identical leak

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35816 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
