Subject: CVE-2024-53081: media: ar0521: don't overflow when checking PLL values

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: ar0521: don't overflow when checking PLL values

The PLL checks are comparing 64 bit integers with 32 bit
ones, as reported by Coverity. Depending on the values of
the variables, this may underflow.

Fix it ensuring that both sides of the expression are u64.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53081 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
