Subject: CVE-2024-57906: iio: adc: ti-ads8688: fix information leak in triggered buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: ti-ads8688: fix information leak in triggered buffer

The 'buffer' local array is used to push data to user space from a
triggered buffer, but it does not set values for inactive channels, as
it only uses iio_for_each_active_channel() to assign new values.

Initialize the array to zero before using it to avoid pushing
uninitialized information to userspace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57906 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
