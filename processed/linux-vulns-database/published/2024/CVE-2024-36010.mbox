Subject: CVE-2024-36010: igb: Fix string truncation warnings in igb_set_fw_version

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igb: Fix string truncation warnings in igb_set_fw_version

Commit 1978d3ead82c ("intel: fix string truncation warnings")
fixes '-Wformat-truncation=' warnings in igb_main.c by using kasprintf.

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c:3092:53: warning：‘%d’ directive output may be truncated writing between 1 and 5 bytes into a region of size between 1 and 13 [-Wformat-truncation=]
 3092 |                                  "%d.%d, 0x%08x, %d.%d.%d",
      |                                                     ^~

 3092 |                                  "%d.%d, 0x%08x, %d.%d.%d",

drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c:3090:25: note：‘snprintf’ output between 23 and 43 bytes into a destination of size 32

kasprintf() returns a pointer to dynamically allocated memory
which can be NULL upon failure.

Fix this warning by using a larger space for adapter->fw_version,
and then fall back and continue to use snprintf.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36010 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb.h
	drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
