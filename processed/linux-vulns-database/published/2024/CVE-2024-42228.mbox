Subject: CVE-2024-42228: drm/amdgpu: Using uninitialized value *size when calling amdgpu_vce_cs_reloc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Using uninitialized value *size when calling amdgpu_vce_cs_reloc

Initialize the size before calling amdgpu_vce_cs_reloc, such as case 0x03000001.
V2: To really improve the handling we would actually
   need to have a separate value of 0xffffffff.(Christian)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42228 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
