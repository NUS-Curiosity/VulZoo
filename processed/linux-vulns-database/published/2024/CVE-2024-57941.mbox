Subject: CVE-2024-57941: netfs: Fix the (non-)cancellation of copy when cache is temporarily disabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Fix the (non-)cancellation of copy when cache is temporarily disabled

When the caching for a cookie is temporarily disabled (e.g. due to a DIO
write on that file), future copying to the cache for that file is disabled
until all fds open on that file are closed.  However, if netfslib is using
the deprecated PG_private_2 method (such as is currently used by ceph), and
decides it wants to copy to the cache, netfs_advance_write() will just bail
at the first check seeing that the cache stream is unavailable, and
indicate that it dealt with all the content.

This means that we have no subrequests to provide notifications to drive
the state machine or even to pin the request and the request just gets
discarded, leaving the folios with PG_private_2 set.

Fix this by jumping directly to cancel the request if the cache is not
available.  That way, we don't remove mark3 from the folio_queue list and
netfs_pgpriv2_cancel() will clean up the folios.

This was found by running the generic/013 xfstest against ceph with an
active cache and the "-o fsc" option passed to ceph.  That would usually
hang

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57941 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ba37bdfe59fb43e80dd79290340a21864ba4b61e
