Subject: CVE-2024-54683: netfilter: IDLETIMER: Fix for possible ABBA deadlock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: IDLETIMER: Fix for possible ABBA deadlock

Deletion of the last rule referencing a given idletimer may happen at
the same time as a read of its file in sysfs:

| ======================================================
| WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
| 6.12.0-rc7-01692-g5e9a28f41134-dirty #594 Not tainted
| ------------------------------------------------------
| iptables/3303 is trying to acquire lock:
| ffff8881057e04b8 (kn->active#48){++++}-{0:0}, at: __kernfs_remove+0x20
|
| but task is already holding lock:
| ffffffffa0249068 (list_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: idletimer_tg_destroy_v]
|
| which lock already depends on the new lock.

A simple reproducer is:

| #!/bin/bash
|
| while true; do
|         iptables -A INPUT -i foo -j IDLETIMER --timeout 10 --label "testme"
|         iptables -D INPUT -i foo -j IDLETIMER --timeout 10 --label "testme"
| done &
| while true; do
|         cat /sys/class/xt_idletimer/timers/testme >/dev/null
| done

Avoid this by freeing list_mutex right after deleting the element from
the list, then continuing with the teardown.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-54683 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8c2c8445cda8f59c38dec7dc10509bcb23ae26a0
