Subject: CVE-2024-46714: drm/amd/display: Skip wbscl_set_scaler_filter if filter is null

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Skip wbscl_set_scaler_filter if filter is null

Callers can pass null in filter (i.e. from returned from the function
wbscl_get_filter_coeffs_16p) and a null check is added to ensure that is
not the case.

This fixes 4 NULL_RETURNS issues reported by Coverity.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46714 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
