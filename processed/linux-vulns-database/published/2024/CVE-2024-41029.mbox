Subject: CVE-2024-41029: nvmem: core: limit cell sysfs permissions to main attribute ones

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmem: core: limit cell sysfs permissions to main attribute ones

The cell sysfs attribute should not provide more access to the nvmem
data than the main attribute itself.
For example if nvme_config::root_only was set, the cell attribute
would still provide read access to everybody.

Mask out permissions not available on the main attribute.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41029 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.8 with commit 0331c611949f and fixed in 6.9.10 with commit aa066afaaac3
	Issue introduced in 6.8 with commit 0331c611949f and fixed in 6.10 with commit 6bef98bafd82

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
