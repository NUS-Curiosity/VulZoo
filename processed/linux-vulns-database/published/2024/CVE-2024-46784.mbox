Subject: CVE-2024-46784: net: mana: Fix error handling in mana_create_txq/rxq's NAPI cleanup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Currently napi_disable() gets called during rxq and txq cleanup,
even before napi is enabled and hrtimer is initialized. It causes
kernel panic.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
