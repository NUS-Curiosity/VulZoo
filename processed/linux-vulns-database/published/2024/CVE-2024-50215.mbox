Subject: CVE-2024-50215: nvmet-auth: assign dh_key to NULL after kfree_sensitive

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet-auth: assign dh_key to NULL after kfree_sensitive

ctrl->dh_key might be used across multiple calls to nvmet_setup_dhgroup()
for the same controller. So it's better to nullify it after release on
error path in order to avoid double free later in nvmet_destroy_auth().

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Svace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50215 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
