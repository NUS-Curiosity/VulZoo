Subject: CVE-2024-53069: firmware: qcom: scm: fix a NULL-pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: qcom: scm: fix a NULL-pointer dereference

Some SCM calls can be invoked with __scm being NULL (the driver may not
have been and will not be probed as there's no SCM entry in device-tree).
Make sure we don't dereference a NULL pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53069 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
