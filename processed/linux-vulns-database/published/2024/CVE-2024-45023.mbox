Subject: CVE-2024-45023: md/raid1: Fix data corruption for degraded array with slow disk

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid1: Fix data corruption for degraded array with slow disk

read_balance() will avoid reading from slow disks as much as possible,
however, if valid data only lands in slow disks, and a new normal disk
is still in recovery, unrecovered data can be read:

raid1_read_request
 read_balance
  raid1_should_read_first
  -> return false
  choose_best_rdev
  -> normal disk is not recovered, return -1
  choose_bb_rdev
  -> missing the checking of recovery, return the normal disk
 -> read unrecovered data

Root cause is that the checking of recovery is missing in
choose_bb_rdev(). Hence add such checking to fix the problem.

Also fix similar problem in choose_slow_rdev().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-45023 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
