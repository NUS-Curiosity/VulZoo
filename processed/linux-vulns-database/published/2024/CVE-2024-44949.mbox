Subject: CVE-2024-44949: parisc: fix a possible DMA corruption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

parisc: fix a possible DMA corruption

ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN was defined as 16 - this is too small - it may be
possible that two unrelated 16-byte allocations share a cache line. If
one of these allocations is written using DMA and the other is written
using cached write, the value that was written with DMA may be
corrupted.

This commit changes ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN to be 128 on PA20 and 32 on PA1.1 -
that's the largest possible cache line size.

As different parisc microarchitectures have different cache line size, we
define arch_slab_minalign(), cache_line_size() and
dma_get_cache_alignment() so that the kernel may tune slab cache
parameters dynamically, based on the detected cache line size.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44949 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	arch/parisc/Kconfig
	arch/parisc/include/asm/cache.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
