Subject: CVE-2024-26835: netfilter: nf_tables: set dormant flag on hook register failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: set dormant flag on hook register failure

We need to set the dormant flag again if we fail to register
the hooks.

During memory pressure hook registration can fail and we end up
with a table marked as active but no registered hooks.

On table/base chain deletion, nf_tables will attempt to unregister
the hook again which yields a warn splat from the nftables core.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26835 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
