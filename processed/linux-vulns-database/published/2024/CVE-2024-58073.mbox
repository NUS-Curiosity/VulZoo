Subject: CVE-2024-58073: drm/msm/dpu: check dpu_plane_atomic_print_state() for valid sspp

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: check dpu_plane_atomic_print_state() for valid sspp

Similar to the r_pipe sspp protect, add a check to protect
the pipe state prints to avoid NULL ptr dereference for cases when
the state is dumped without a corresponding atomic_check() where the
pipe->sspp is assigned.

Patchwork: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/628404/

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58073 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/008af2074e4b91d34440102501b710c235a3b245
