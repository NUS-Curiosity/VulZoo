Subject: CVE-2024-35838: wifi: mac80211: fix potential sta-link leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix potential sta-link leak

When a station is allocated, links are added but not
set to valid yet (e.g. during connection to an AP MLD),
we might remove the station without ever marking links
valid, and leak them. Fix that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35838 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
