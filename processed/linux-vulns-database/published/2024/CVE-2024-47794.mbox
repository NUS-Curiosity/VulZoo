Subject: CVE-2024-47794: bpf: Prevent tailcall infinite loop caused by freplace

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Prevent tailcall infinite loop caused by freplace

There is a potential infinite loop issue that can occur when using a
combination of tail calls and freplace.

In an upcoming selftest, the attach target for entry_freplace of
tailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the tail call in
entry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an infinite loop:

entry_tc -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc.

The problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to
zero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism
to never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.

To fix this issue, the solution is twofold:

1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a
   prog_array map.
2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map
   with an freplace program.

This ensures that:

* If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program,
  it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map.
* If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its
  subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.

Moreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return
-EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a
prog_array map.

Additionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a
tab for proper formatting.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47794 to this issue.

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-47794
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	include/linux/bpf.h
	kernel/bpf/arraymap.c
	kernel/bpf/core.c
	kernel/bpf/syscall.c
	kernel/bpf/trampoline.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/987aa730bad3e1ef66d9f30182294daa78f6387d
