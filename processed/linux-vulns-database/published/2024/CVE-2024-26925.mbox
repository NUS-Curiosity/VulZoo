Subject: CVE-2024-26925: netfilter: nf_tables: release mutex after nft_gc_seq_end from abort path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: release mutex after nft_gc_seq_end from abort path

The commit mutex should not be released during the critical section
between nft_gc_seq_begin() and nft_gc_seq_end(), otherwise, async GC
worker could collect expired objects and get the released commit lock
within the same GC sequence.

nf_tables_module_autoload() temporarily releases the mutex to load
module dependencies, then it goes back to replay the transaction again.
Move it at the end of the abort phase after nft_gc_seq_end() is called.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26925 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
