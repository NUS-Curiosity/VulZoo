Subject: CVE-2024-50266: clk: qcom: videocc-sm8350: use HW_CTRL_TRIGGER for vcodec GDSCs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: qcom: videocc-sm8350: use HW_CTRL_TRIGGER for vcodec GDSCs

A recent change in the venus driver results in a stuck clock on the
Lenovo ThinkPad X13s, for example, when streaming video in firefox:

	video_cc_mvs0_clk status stuck at 'off'
	WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 2885 at drivers/clk/qcom/clk-branch.c:87 clk_branch_wait+0x144/0x15c
	...
	Call trace:
	 clk_branch_wait+0x144/0x15c
	 clk_branch2_enable+0x30/0x40
	 clk_core_enable+0xd8/0x29c
	 clk_enable+0x2c/0x4c
	 vcodec_clks_enable.isra.0+0x94/0xd8 [venus_core]

	 v4l2_m2m_ioctl_streamon+0x30/0x80 [v4l2_mem2mem]
	 v4l_streamon+0x24/0x30 [videodev]

using the out-of-tree sm8350/sc8280xp venus support. [1]

Update also the sm8350/sc8280xp GDSC definitions so that the hw control
mode can be changed at runtime as the venus driver now requires.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50266 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d055f6f2bdfb8b9c9bc071f748c16bd3afb2db0f
