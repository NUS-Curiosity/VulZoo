Subject: CVE-2024-35903: x86/bpf: Fix IP after emitting call depth accounting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/bpf: Fix IP after emitting call depth accounting

Adjust the IP passed to `emit_patch` so it calculates the correct offset
for the CALL instruction if `x86_call_depth_emit_accounting` emits code.
Otherwise we will skip some instructions and most likely crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35903 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
