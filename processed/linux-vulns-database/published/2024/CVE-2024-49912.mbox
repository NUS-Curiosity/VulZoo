Subject: CVE-2024-49912: drm/amd/display: Handle null 'stream_status' in 'planes_changed_for_existing_stream'

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Handle null 'stream_status' in 'planes_changed_for_existing_stream'

This commit adds a null check for 'stream_status' in the function
'planes_changed_for_existing_stream'. Previously, the code assumed
'stream_status' could be null, but did not handle the case where it was
actually null. This could lead to a null pointer dereference.

Reported by smatch:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc_resource.c:3784 planes_changed_for_existing_stream() error: we previously assumed 'stream_status' could be null (see line 3774)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49912 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
