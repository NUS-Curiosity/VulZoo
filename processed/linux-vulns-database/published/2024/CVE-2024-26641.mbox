Subject: CVE-2024-26641: ip6_tunnel: make sure to pull inner header in __ip6_tnl_rcv()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ip6_tunnel: make sure to pull inner header in __ip6_tnl_rcv()

syzbot found __ip6_tnl_rcv() could access unitiliazed data [1].

Call pskb_inet_may_pull() to fix this, and initialize ipv6h
variable after this call as it can change skb->head.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
