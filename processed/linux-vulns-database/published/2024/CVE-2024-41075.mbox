Subject: CVE-2024-41075: cachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachefiles: add consistency check for copen/cread

This prevents malicious processes from completing random copen/cread
requests and crashing the system. Added checks are listed below:

  * Generic, copen can only complete open requests, and cread can only
    complete read requests.
  * For copen, ondemand_id must not be 0, because this indicates that the
    request has not been read by the daemon.
  * For cread, the object corresponding to fd and req should be the same.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41075 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
