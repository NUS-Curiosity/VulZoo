Subject: CVE-2024-26652: net: pds_core: Fix possible double free in error handling path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: pds_core: Fix possible double free in error handling path

When auxiliary_device_add() returns error and then calls
auxiliary_device_uninit(), Callback function pdsc_auxbus_dev_release
calls kfree(padev) to free memory. We shouldn't call kfree(padev)
again in the error handling path.

Fix this by cleaning up the redundant kfree() and putting
the error handling back to where the errors happened.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26652 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
