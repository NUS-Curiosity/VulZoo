Subject: CVE-2024-35888: erspan: make sure erspan_base_hdr is present in skb->head

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erspan: make sure erspan_base_hdr is present in skb->head

syzbot reported a problem in ip6erspan_rcv() [1]

Issue is that ip6erspan_rcv() (and erspan_rcv()) no longer make
sure erspan_base_hdr is present in skb linear part (skb->head)
before getting @ver field from it.

Add the missing pskb_may_pull() calls.

v2: Reload iph pointer in erspan_rcv() after pskb_may_pull()
    because skb->head might have changed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
