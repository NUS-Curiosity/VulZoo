Subject: CVE-2024-50199: mm/swapfile: skip HugeTLB pages for unuse_vma

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/swapfile: skip HugeTLB pages for unuse_vma

I got a bad pud error and lost a 1GB HugeTLB when calling swapoff.  The
problem can be reproduced by the following steps:

 1. Allocate an anonymous 1GB HugeTLB and some other anonymous memory.
 2. Swapout the above anonymous memory.
 3. run swapoff and we will get a bad pud error in kernel message:

  mm/pgtable-generic.c:42: bad pud 00000000743d215d(84000001400000e7)

We can tell that pud_clear_bad is called by pud_none_or_clear_bad in
unuse_pud_range() by ftrace.  And therefore the HugeTLB pages will never
be freed because we lost it from page table.  We can skip HugeTLB pages
for unuse_vma to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50199 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
