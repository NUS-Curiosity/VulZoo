Subject: CVE-2024-47748: vhost_vdpa: assign irq bypass producer token correctly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vhost_vdpa: assign irq bypass producer token correctly

We used to call irq_bypass_unregister_producer() in
vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which is problematic as we don't know if the
token pointer is still valid or not.

Actually, we use the eventfd_ctx as the token so the life cycle of the
token should be bound to the VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL instead of
vhost_vdpa_setup_vq_irq() which could be called by set_status().

Fixing this by setting up irq bypass producer's token when handling
VHOST_SET_VRING_CALL and un-registering the producer before calling
vhost_vring_ioctl() to prevent a possible use after free as eventfd
could have been released in vhost_vring_ioctl(). And such registering
and unregistering will only be done if DRIVER_OK is set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47748 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
