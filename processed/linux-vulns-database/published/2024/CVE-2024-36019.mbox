Subject: CVE-2024-36019: regmap: maple: Fix cache corruption in regcache_maple_drop()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

regmap: maple: Fix cache corruption in regcache_maple_drop()

When keeping the upper end of a cache block entry, the entry[] array
must be indexed by the offset from the base register of the block,
i.e. max - mas.index.

The code was indexing entry[] by only the register address, leading
to an out-of-bounds access that copied some part of the kernel
memory over the cache contents.

This bug was not detected by the regmap KUnit test because it only
tests with a block of registers starting at 0, so mas.index == 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36019 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
