Subject: CVE-2024-39473: ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Fix input format query of process modules without base extension

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Fix input format query of process modules without base extension

If a process module does not have base config extension then the same
format applies to all of it's inputs and the process->base_config_ext is
NULL, causing NULL dereference when specifically crafted topology and
sequences used.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39473 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
