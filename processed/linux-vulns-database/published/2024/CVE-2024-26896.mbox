Subject: CVE-2024-26896: wifi: wfx: fix memory leak when starting AP

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: wfx: fix memory leak when starting AP

Kmemleak reported this error:

However, since the kernel is build optimized, it seems the stack is not
accurate. It appears the issue is related to wfx_set_mfp_ap(). The issue
is obvious in this function: memory allocated by ieee80211_beacon_get()
is never released. Fixing this leak makes kmemleak happy.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26896 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
