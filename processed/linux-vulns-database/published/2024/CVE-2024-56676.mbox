Subject: CVE-2024-56676: thermal: testing: Initialize some variables annoteded with _free()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: testing: Initialize some variables annoteded with _free()

Variables annotated with __free() need to be initialized if the function
can return before they get updated for the first time or the attempt to
free the memory pointed to by them upon function return may crash the
kernel.

Fix this issue in some places in the thermal testing code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56676 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
