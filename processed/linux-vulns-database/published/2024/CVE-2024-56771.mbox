Subject: CVE-2024-56771: mtd: spinand: winbond: Fix 512GW, 01GW, 01JW and 02JW ECC information

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: spinand: winbond: Fix 512GW, 01GW, 01JW and 02JW ECC information

These four chips:
* W25N512GW
* W25N01GW
* W25N01JW
* W25N02JW
all require a single bit of ECC strength and thus feature an on-die
Hamming-like ECC engine. There is no point in filling a ->get_status()
callback for them because the main ECC status bytes are located in
standard places, and retrieving the number of bitflips in case of
corrected chunk is both useless and unsupported (if there are bitflips,
then there is 1 at most, so no need to query the chip for that).

Without this change, a kernel warning triggers every time a bit flips.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56771 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/234d5f75c3ae911b52c5e4442b8a87fbbd129836
