Subject: CVE-2024-56369: drm/modes: Avoid divide by zero harder in drm_mode_vrefresh()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/modes: Avoid divide by zero harder in drm_mode_vrefresh()

drm_mode_vrefresh() is trying to avoid divide by zero
by checking whether htotal or vtotal are zero. But we may
still end up with a div-by-zero of vtotal*htotal*...

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56369 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
