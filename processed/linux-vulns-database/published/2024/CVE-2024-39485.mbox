Subject: CVE-2024-39485: media: v4l: async: Properly re-initialise notifier entry in unregister

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: v4l: async: Properly re-initialise notifier entry in unregister

The notifier_entry of a notifier is not re-initialised after unregistering
the notifier. This leads to dangling pointers being left there so use
list_del_init() to return the notifier_entry an empty list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39485 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
