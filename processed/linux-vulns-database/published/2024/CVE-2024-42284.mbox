Subject: CVE-2024-42284: tipc: Return non-zero value from tipc_udp_addr2str() on error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tipc: Return non-zero value from tipc_udp_addr2str() on error

tipc_udp_addr2str() should return non-zero value if the UDP media
address is invalid. Otherwise, a buffer overflow access can occur in
tipc_media_addr_printf(). Fix this by returning 1 on an invalid UDP
media address.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42284 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
