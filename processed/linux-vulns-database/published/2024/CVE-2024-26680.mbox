Subject: CVE-2024-26680: net: atlantic: Fix DMA mapping for PTP hwts ring

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: atlantic: Fix DMA mapping for PTP hwts ring

Function aq_ring_hwts_rx_alloc() maps extra AQ_CFG_RXDS_DEF bytes
for PTP HWTS ring but then generic aq_ring_free() does not take this
into account.
Create and use a specific function to free HWTS ring to fix this
issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
