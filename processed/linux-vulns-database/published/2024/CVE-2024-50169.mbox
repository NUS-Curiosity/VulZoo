Subject: CVE-2024-50169: vsock: Update rx_bytes on read_skb()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Update rx_bytes on read_skb()

Make sure virtio_transport_inc_rx_pkt() and virtio_transport_dec_rx_pkt()
calls are balanced (i.e. virtio_vsock_sock::rx_bytes doesn't lie) after
vsock_transport::read_skb().

While here, also inform the peer that we've freed up space and it has more
credit.

Failing to update rx_bytes after packet is dequeued leads to a warning on
SOCK_STREAM recv():

[  233.396654] rx_queue is empty, but rx_bytes is non-zero
[  233.396702] WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 40601 at net/vmw_vsock/virtio_transport_common.c:589

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50169 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
