Subject: CVE-2024-45020: bpf: Fix a kernel verifier crash in stacksafe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix a kernel verifier crash in stacksafe()

Daniel Hodges reported a kernel verifier crash when playing with sched-ext.
Further investigation shows that the crash is due to invalid memory access
in stacksafe(). More specifically, it is the following code:

    if (exact != NOT_EXACT &&
        old->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] !=
        cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE])
            return false;

The 'i' iterates old->allocated_stack.
If cur->allocated_stack < old->allocated_stack the out-of-bound
access will happen.

To fix the issue add 'i >= cur->allocated_stack' check such that if
the condition is true, stacksafe() should fail. Otherwise,
cur->stack[spi].slot_type[i % BPF_REG_SIZE] memory access is legal.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-45020 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7cad3174cc79519bf5f6c4441780264416822c08
