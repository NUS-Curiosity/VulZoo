Subject: CVE-2024-50176: remoteproc: k3-r5: Fix error handling when power-up failed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: k3-r5: Fix error handling when power-up failed

By simply bailing out, the driver was violating its rule and internal
assumptions that either both or no rproc should be initialized. E.g.,
this could cause the first core to be available but not the second one,
leading to crashes on its shutdown later on while trying to dereference
that second instance.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50176 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
