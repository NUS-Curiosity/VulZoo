Subject: CVE-2024-50253: bpf: Check the validity of nr_words in bpf_iter_bits_new()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Check the validity of nr_words in bpf_iter_bits_new()

Check the validity of nr_words in bpf_iter_bits_new(). Without this
check, when multiplication overflow occurs for nr_bits (e.g., when
nr_words = 0x0400-0001, nr_bits becomes 64), stack corruption may occur
due to bpf_probe_read_kernel_common(..., nr_bytes = 0x2000-0008).

Fix it by limiting the maximum value of nr_words to 511. The value is
derived from the current implementation of BPF memory allocator. To
ensure compatibility if the BPF memory allocator's size limitation
changes in the future, use the helper bpf_mem_alloc_check_size() to
check whether nr_bytes is too larger. And return -E2BIG instead of
-ENOMEM for oversized nr_bytes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50253 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c9539e09c67880ecd88b51188c346a2cc078b06c
