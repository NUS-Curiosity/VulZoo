Subject: CVE-2024-36954: tipc: fix a possible memleak in tipc_buf_append

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tipc: fix a possible memleak in tipc_buf_append

__skb_linearize() doesn't free the skb when it fails, so move
'*buf = NULL' after __skb_linearize(), so that the skb can be
freed on the err path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36954 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
