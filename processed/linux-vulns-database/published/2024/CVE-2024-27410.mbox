Subject: CVE-2024-27410: wifi: nl80211: reject iftype change with mesh ID change

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: nl80211: reject iftype change with mesh ID change

It's currently possible to change the mesh ID when the
interface isn't yet in mesh mode, at the same time as
changing it into mesh mode. This leads to an overwrite
of data in the wdev->u union for the interface type it
currently has, causing cfg80211_change_iface() to do
wrong things when switching.

We could probably allow setting an interface to mesh
while setting the mesh ID at the same time by doing a
different order of operations here, but realistically
there's no userspace that's going to do this, so just
disallow changes in iftype when setting mesh ID.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27410 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
