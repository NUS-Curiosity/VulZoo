Subject: CVE-2024-44996: vsock: fix recursive ->recvmsg calls

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: fix recursive ->recvmsg calls

After a vsock socket has been added to a BPF sockmap, its prot->recvmsg
has been replaced with vsock_bpf_recvmsg(). Thus the following
recursiion could happen:

vsock_bpf_recvmsg()
 -> __vsock_recvmsg()
  -> vsock_connectible_recvmsg()
   -> prot->recvmsg()
    -> vsock_bpf_recvmsg() again

We need to fix it by calling the original ->recvmsg() without any BPF
sockmap logic in __vsock_recvmsg().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44996 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
