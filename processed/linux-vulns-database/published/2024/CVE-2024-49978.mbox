Subject: CVE-2024-49978: gso: fix udp gso fraglist segmentation after pull from frag_list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gso: fix udp gso fraglist segmentation after pull from frag_list

Detect gso fraglist skbs with corrupted geometry (see below) and
pass these to skb_segment instead of skb_segment_list, as the first
can segment them correctly.

Valid SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs
- consist of two or more segments
- the head_skb holds the protocol headers plus first gso_size
- one or more frag_list skbs hold exactly one segment
- all but the last must be gso_size

Optional datapath hooks such as NAT and BPF (bpf_skb_pull_data) can
modify these skbs, breaking these invariants.

In extreme cases they pull all data into skb linear. For UDP, this
causes a NULL ptr deref in __udpv4_gso_segment_list_csum at
udp_hdr(seg->next)->dest.

Detect invalid geometry due to pull, by checking head_skb size.
Don't just drop, as this may blackhole a destination. Convert to be
able to pass to regular skb_segment.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49978 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
