Subject: CVE-2024-50026: scsi: wd33c93: Don't use stale scsi_pointer value

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: wd33c93: Don't use stale scsi_pointer value

A regression was introduced with commit dbb2da557a6a ("scsi: wd33c93:
Move the SCSI pointer to private command data") which results in an oops
in wd33c93_intr(). That commit added the scsi_pointer variable and
initialized it from hostdata->connected. However, during selection,
hostdata->connected is not yet valid. Fix this by getting the current
scsi_pointer from hostdata->selecting.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50026 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
