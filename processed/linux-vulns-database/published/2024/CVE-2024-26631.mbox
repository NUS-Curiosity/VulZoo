Subject: CVE-2024-26631: ipv6: mcast: fix data-race in ipv6_mc_down / mld_ifc_work

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: mcast: fix data-race in ipv6_mc_down / mld_ifc_work

idev->mc_ifc_count can be written over without proper locking.

Originally found by syzbot [1], fix this issue by encapsulating calls
to mld_ifc_stop_work() (and mld_gq_stop_work() for good measure) with
mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock() accordingly as these functions
should only be called with mc_lock per their declarations.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
