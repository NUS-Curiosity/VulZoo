Subject: CVE-2024-56557: iio: adc: ad7923: Fix buffer overflow for tx_buf and ring_xfer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: ad7923: Fix buffer overflow for tx_buf and ring_xfer

The AD7923 was updated to support devices with 8 channels, but the size
of tx_buf and ring_xfer was not increased accordingly, leading to a
potential buffer overflow in ad7923_update_scan_mode().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56557 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
