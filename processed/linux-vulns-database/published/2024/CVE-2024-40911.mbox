Subject: CVE-2024-40911: wifi: cfg80211: Lock wiphy in cfg80211_get_station

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: Lock wiphy in cfg80211_get_station

Wiphy should be locked before calling rdev_get_station() (see lockdep
assert in ieee80211_get_station()).

This fixes the following kernel NULL dereference:

 Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000050

This happens because STA has time to disconnect and reconnect before
batadv_v_elp_throughput_metric_update() delayed work gets scheduled. In
this situation, ath10k_sta_state() can be in the middle of resetting
arsta data when the work queue get chance to be scheduled and ends up
accessing it. Locking wiphy prevents that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40911 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
