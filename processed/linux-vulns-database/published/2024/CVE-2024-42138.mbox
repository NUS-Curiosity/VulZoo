Subject: CVE-2024-42138: mlxsw: core_linecards: Fix double memory deallocation in case of invalid INI file

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: core_linecards: Fix double memory deallocation in case of invalid INI file

In case of invalid INI file mlxsw_linecard_types_init() deallocates memory
but doesn't reset pointer to NULL and returns 0. In case of any error
occurred after mlxsw_linecard_types_init() call, mlxsw_linecards_init()
calls mlxsw_linecard_types_fini() which performs memory deallocation again.

Add pointer reset to NULL.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42138 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
