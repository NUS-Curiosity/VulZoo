Subject: CVE-2024-50258: net: fix crash when config small gso_max_size/gso_ipv4_max_size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fix crash when config small gso_max_size/gso_ipv4_max_size

Config a small gso_max_size/gso_ipv4_max_size will lead to an underflow
in sk_dst_gso_max_size(), which may trigger a BUG_ON crash,
because sk->sk_gso_max_size would be much bigger than device limits.
Call Trace:
tcp_write_xmit
    tso_segs = tcp_init_tso_segs(skb, mss_now);
        tcp_set_skb_tso_segs
            tcp_skb_pcount_set
                // skb->len = 524288, mss_now = 8
                // u16 tso_segs = 524288/8 = 65535 -> 0
                tso_segs = DIV_ROUND_UP(skb->len, mss_now)
    BUG_ON(!tso_segs)
Add check for the minimum value of gso_max_size and gso_ipv4_max_size.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50258 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
