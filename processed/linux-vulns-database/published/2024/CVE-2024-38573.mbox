Subject: CVE-2024-38573: cppc_cpufreq: Fix possible null pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cppc_cpufreq: Fix possible null pointer dereference

cppc_cpufreq_get_rate() and hisi_cppc_cpufreq_get_rate() can be called from
different places with various parameters. So cpufreq_cpu_get() can return
null as 'policy' in some circumstances.
Fix this bug by adding null return check.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38573 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
