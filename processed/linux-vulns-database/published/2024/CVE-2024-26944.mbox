Subject: CVE-2024-26944: btrfs: zoned: fix use-after-free in do_zone_finish()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: zoned: fix use-after-free in do_zone_finish()

Shinichiro reported the following use-after-free triggered by the device
replace operation in fstests btrfs/070.

 BTRFS info (device nullb1): scrub: finished on devid 1 with status: 0

This UAF happens because we're accessing stale zone information of a
already removed btrfs_device in do_zone_finish().

The sequence of events is as follows:

btrfs_dev_replace_start
  btrfs_scrub_dev
   btrfs_dev_replace_finishing
    btrfs_dev_replace_update_device_in_mapping_tree <-- devices replaced
    btrfs_rm_dev_replace_free_srcdev
     btrfs_free_device                              <-- device freed

cleaner_kthread
 btrfs_delete_unused_bgs
  btrfs_zone_finish
   do_zone_finish              <-- refers the freed device

The reason for this is that we're using a cached pointer to the chunk_map
from the block group, but on device replace this cached pointer can
contain stale device entries.

The staleness comes from the fact, that btrfs_block_group::physical_map is
not a pointer to a btrfs_chunk_map but a memory copy of it.

Also take the fs_info::dev_replace::rwsem to prevent
btrfs_dev_replace_update_device_in_mapping_tree() from changing the device
underneath us again.

Note: btrfs_dev_replace_update_device_in_mapping_tree() is holding
fs_info::mapping_tree_lock, but as this is a spinning read/write lock we
cannot take it as the call to blkdev_zone_mgmt() requires a memory
allocation which may not sleep.
But btrfs_dev_replace_update_device_in_mapping_tree() is always called with
the fs_info::dev_replace::rwsem held in write mode.

Many thanks to Shinichiro for analyzing the bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26944 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
