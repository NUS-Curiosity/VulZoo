Subject: CVE-2024-56584: io_uring/tctx: work around xa_store() allocation error issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/tctx: work around xa_store() allocation error issue

syzbot triggered the following WARN_ON:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 16 at io_uring/tctx.c:51 __io_uring_free+0xfa/0x140 io_uring/tctx.c:51

which is the

WARN_ON_ONCE(!xa_empty(&tctx->xa));

sanity check in __io_uring_free() when a io_uring_task is going through
its final put. The syzbot test case includes injecting memory allocation
failures, and it very much looks like xa_store() can fail one of its
memory allocations and end up with ->head being non-NULL even though no
entries exist in the xarray.

Until this issue gets sorted out, work around it by attempting to
iterate entries in our xarray, and WARN_ON_ONCE() if one is found.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56584 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
