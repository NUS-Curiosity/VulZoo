Subject: CVE-2024-42140: riscv: kexec: Avoid deadlock in kexec crash path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: kexec: Avoid deadlock in kexec crash path

If the kexec crash code is called in the interrupt context, the
machine_kexec_mask_interrupts() function will trigger a deadlock while
trying to acquire the irqdesc spinlock and then deactivate irqchip in
irq_set_irqchip_state() function.

Unlike arm64, riscv only requires irq_eoi handler to complete EOI and
keeping irq_set_irqchip_state() will only leave this possible deadlock
without any use. So we simply remove it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42140 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
