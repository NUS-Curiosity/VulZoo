Subject: CVE-2024-26582: net: tls: fix use-after-free with partial reads and async decrypt

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: tls: fix use-after-free with partial reads and async decrypt

tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb,
so the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger
a use-after-free in process_rx_list when we try to read from the
partially-read skb.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26582 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
