Subject: CVE-2024-57993: HID: hid-thrustmaster: Fix warning in thrustmaster_probe by adding endpoint check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: hid-thrustmaster: Fix warning in thrustmaster_probe by adding endpoint check

syzbot has found a type mismatch between a USB pipe and the transfer
endpoint, which is triggered by the hid-thrustmaster driver[1].
There is a number of similar, already fixed issues [2].
In this case as in others, implementing check for endpoint type fixes the issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
