Subject: CVE-2024-53084: drm/imagination: Break an object reference loop

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/imagination: Break an object reference loop

When remaining resources are being cleaned up on driver close,
outstanding VM mappings may result in resources being leaked, due
to an object reference loop, as shown below, with each object (or
set of objects) referencing the object below it:

    PVR GEM Object
    GPU scheduler "finished" fence
    GPU scheduler “scheduled” fence
    PVR driver “done” fence
    PVR Context
    PVR VM Context
    PVR VM Mappings
    PVR GEM Object

The reference that the PVR VM Context has on the VM mappings is a
soft one, in the sense that the freeing of outstanding VM mappings
is done as part of VM context destruction; no reference counts are
involved, as is the case for all the other references in the loop.

To break the reference loop during cleanup, free the outstanding
VM mappings before destroying the PVR Context associated with the
VM context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53084 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cb86db12b290ed07d05df00d99fa150bb123e80e
