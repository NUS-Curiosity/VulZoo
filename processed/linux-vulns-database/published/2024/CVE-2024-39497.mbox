Subject: CVE-2024-39497: drm/shmem-helper: Fix BUG_ON() on mmap(PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE)

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/shmem-helper: Fix BUG_ON() on mmap(PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE)

Lack of check for copy-on-write (COW) mapping in drm_gem_shmem_mmap
allows users to call mmap with PROT_WRITE and MAP_PRIVATE flag
causing a kernel panic due to BUG_ON in vmf_insert_pfn_prot:
BUG_ON((vma->vm_flags & VM_PFNMAP) && is_cow_mapping(vma->vm_flags));

Return -EINVAL early if COW mapping is detected.

This bug affects all drm drivers using default shmem helpers.
It can be reproduced by this simple example:
void *ptr = mmap(0, size, PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, mmap_offset);
ptr[0] = 0;

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39497 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
