Subject: CVE-2024-27058: tmpfs: fix race on handling dquot rbtree

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tmpfs: fix race on handling dquot rbtree

A syzkaller reproducer found a race while attempting to remove dquot
information from the rb tree.

Fetching the rb_tree root node must also be protected by the
dqopt->dqio_sem, otherwise, giving the right timing, shmem_release_dquot()
will trigger a warning because it couldn't find a node in the tree, when
the real reason was the root node changing before the search starts:

Thread 1				Thread 2
- shmem_release_dquot()			- shmem_{acquire,release}_dquot()

- fetch ROOT				- Fetch ROOT

					- acquire dqio_sem
- wait dqio_sem

					- do something, triger a tree rebalance
					- release dqio_sem

- acquire dqio_sem
- start searching for the node, but
  from the wrong location, missing
  the node, and triggering a warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27058 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
