Subject: CVE-2024-50152: smb: client: fix possible double free in smb2_set_ea()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix possible double free in smb2_set_ea()

Clang static checker(scan-build) warningï¼š
fs/smb/client/smb2ops.c:1304:2: Attempt to free released memory.
 1304 |         kfree(ea);
      |         ^~~~~~~~~

There is a double free in such case:
'ea is initialized to NULL' -> 'first successful memory allocation for
ea' -> 'something failed, goto sea_exit' -> 'first memory release for ea'
-> 'goto replay_again' -> 'second goto sea_exit before allocate memory
for ea' -> 'second memory release for ea resulted in double free'.

Re-initialie 'ea' to NULL near to the replay_again label, it can fix this
double free problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50152 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
