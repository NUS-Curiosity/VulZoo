Subject: CVE-2024-26988: init/main.c: Fix potential static_command_line memory overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

init/main.c: Fix potential static_command_line memory overflow

We allocate memory of size 'xlen + strlen(boot_command_line) + 1' for
static_command_line, but the strings copied into static_command_line are
extra_command_line and command_line, rather than extra_command_line and
boot_command_line.

When strlen(command_line) > strlen(boot_command_line), static_command_line
will overflow.

This patch just recovers strlen(command_line) which was miss-consolidated
with strlen(boot_command_line) in the commit f5c7310ac73e ("init/main: add
checks for the return value of memblock_alloc*()")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26988 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
