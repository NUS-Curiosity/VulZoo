Subject: CVE-2024-27011: netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak in map from abort path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak in map from abort path

The delete set command does not rely on the transaction object for
element removal, therefore, a combination of delete element + delete set
from the abort path could result in restoring twice the refcount of the
mapping.

Check for inactive element in the next generation for the delete element
command in the abort path, skip restoring state if next generation bit
has been already cleared. This is similar to the activate logic using
the set walk iterator.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a1bd2a38a1c6388fc8556816dc203c3e9dc52237
