Subject: CVE-2024-44976: ata: pata_macio: Fix DMA table overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ata: pata_macio: Fix DMA table overflow

Kolbjørn and Jonáš reported that their 32-bit PowerMacs were crashing
in pata-macio since commit 09fe2bfa6b83 ("ata: pata_macio: Fix
max_segment_size with PAGE_SIZE == 64K").

For example:

  kernel BUG at drivers/ata/pata_macio.c:544!
  Oops: Exception in kernel mode, sig: 5 [#1]

That commit increased max_segment_size to 64KB, with the justification
that the SCSI core was already using that size when PAGE_SIZE == 64KB,
and that there was existing logic to split over-sized requests.

However with a sufficiently large request, the splitting logic causes
each sg to be split into two commands in the DMA table, leading to
overflow of the DMA table, triggering the BUG_ON().

With default settings the bug doesn't trigger, because the request size
is limited by max_sectors_kb == 1280, however max_sectors_kb can be
increased, and apparently some distros do that by default using udev
rules.

Fix the bug for 4KB kernels by reverting to the old max_segment_size.

For 64KB kernels the sg_tablesize needs to be halved, to allow for the
possibility that each sg will be split into two.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44976 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/709e4c8f78e156ab332297bdd87527ec3da4e2d4
