Subject: CVE-2024-26926: binder: check offset alignment in binder_get_object()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binder: check offset alignment in binder_get_object()

Commit 6d98eb95b450 ("binder: avoid potential data leakage when copying
txn") introduced changes to how binder objects are copied. In doing so,
it unintentionally removed an offset alignment check done through calls
to binder_alloc_copy_from_buffer() -> check_buffer().

These calls were replaced in binder_get_object() with copy_from_user(),
so now an explicit offset alignment check is needed here. This avoids
later complications when unwinding the objects gets harder.

It is worth noting this check existed prior to commit 7a67a39320df
("binder: add function to copy binder object from buffer"), likely
removed due to redundancy at the time.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26926 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
