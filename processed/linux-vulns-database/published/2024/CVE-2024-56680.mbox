Subject: CVE-2024-56680: media: intel/ipu6: do not handle interrupts when device is disabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: intel/ipu6: do not handle interrupts when device is disabled

Some IPU6 devices have shared interrupts. We need to handle properly
case when interrupt is triggered from other device on shared irq line
and IPU6 itself disabled. In such case we get 0xffffffff from
ISR_STATUS register and handle all irq's cases, for what we are not
not prepared and usually hang the whole system.

To avoid the issue use pm_runtime_get_if_active() to check if
the device is enabled and prevent suspending it when we handle irq
until the end of irq. Additionally use synchronize_irq() in suspend

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56680 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
