Subject: CVE-2024-50078: Bluetooth: Call iso_exit() on module unload

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Call iso_exit() on module unload

If iso_init() has been called, iso_exit() must be called on module
unload. Without that, the struct proto that iso_init() registered with
proto_register() becomes invalid, which could cause unpredictable
problems later. In my case, with CONFIG_LIST_HARDENED and
CONFIG_BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION enabled, loading the module again usually
triggers this BUG():

  list_add corruption. next->prev should be prev (ffffffffb5355fd0),
    but was 0000000000000068. (next=ffffffffc0a010d0).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
