Subject: CVE-2024-46871: drm/amd/display: Correct the defined value for AMDGPU_DMUB_NOTIFICATION_MAX

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Correct the defined value for AMDGPU_DMUB_NOTIFICATION_MAX

[Why & How]
It actually exposes '6' types in enum dmub_notification_type. Not 5. Using smaller
number to create array dmub_callback & dmub_thread_offload has potential to access
item out of array bound. Fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46871 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
