Subject: CVE-2024-53226: RDMA/hns: Fix NULL pointer derefernce in hns_roce_map_mr_sg()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/hns: Fix NULL pointer derefernce in hns_roce_map_mr_sg()

ib_map_mr_sg() allows ULPs to specify NULL as the sg_offset argument.
The driver needs to check whether it is a NULL pointer before
dereferencing it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53226 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
