Subject: CVE-2024-27392: nvme: host: fix double-free of struct nvme_id_ns in ns_update_nuse()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme: host: fix double-free of struct nvme_id_ns in ns_update_nuse()

When nvme_identify_ns() fails, it frees the pointer to the struct
nvme_id_ns before it returns. However, ns_update_nuse() calls kfree()
for the pointer even when nvme_identify_ns() fails. This results in
KASAN double-free, which was observed with blktests nvme/045 with
proposed patches [1] on the kernel v6.8-rc7. Fix the double-free by
skipping kfree() when nvme_identify_ns() fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27392 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.8 with commit a1a825ab6a60 and fixed in 6.8.2 with commit 534f9dc7fe49

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/534f9dc7fe495b3f9cc84363898ac50c5a25fccb
