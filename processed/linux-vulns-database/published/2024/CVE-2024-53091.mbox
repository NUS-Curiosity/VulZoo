Subject: CVE-2024-53091: bpf: Add sk_is_inet and IS_ICSK check in tls_sw_has_ctx_tx/rx

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Add sk_is_inet and IS_ICSK check in tls_sw_has_ctx_tx/rx

As the introduction of the support for vsock and unix sockets in sockmap,
tls_sw_has_ctx_tx/rx cannot presume the socket passed in must be IS_ICSK.
vsock and af_unix sockets have vsock_sock and unix_sock instead of
inet_connection_sock. For these sockets, tls_get_ctx may return an invalid
pointer and cause page fault in function tls_sw_ctx_rx.

BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000000040030
Workqueue: vsock-loopback vsock_loopback_work
RIP: 0010:sk_psock_strp_data_ready+0x23/0x60

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a078a480ff3f43d74d8a024ae10c3c7daf6db149
