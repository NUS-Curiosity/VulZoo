Subject: CVE-2024-26882: net: ip_tunnel: make sure to pull inner header in ip_tunnel_rcv()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ip_tunnel: make sure to pull inner header in ip_tunnel_rcv()

Apply the same fix than ones found in :

8d975c15c0cd ("ip6_tunnel: make sure to pull inner header in __ip6_tnl_rcv()")
1ca1ba465e55 ("geneve: make sure to pull inner header in geneve_rx()")

We have to save skb->network_header in a temporary variable
in order to be able to recompute the network_header pointer
after a pskb_inet_may_pull() call.

pskb_inet_may_pull() makes sure the needed headers are in skb->head.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
