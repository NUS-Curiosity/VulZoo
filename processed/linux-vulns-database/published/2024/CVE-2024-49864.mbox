Subject: CVE-2024-49864: rxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rxrpc: Fix a race between socket set up and I/O thread creation

In rxrpc_open_socket(), it sets up the socket and then sets up the I/O
thread that will handle it.  This is a problem, however, as there's a gap
between the two phases in which a packet may come into rxrpc_encap_rcv()
from the UDP packet but we oops when trying to wake the not-yet created I/O
thread.

As a quick fix, just make rxrpc_encap_rcv() discard the packet if there's
no I/O thread yet.

A better, but more intrusive fix would perhaps be to rearrange things such
that the socket creation is done by the I/O thread.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49864 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
