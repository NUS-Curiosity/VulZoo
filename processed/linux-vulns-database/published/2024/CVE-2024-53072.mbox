Subject: CVE-2024-53072: platform/x86/amd/pmc: Detect when STB is not available

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86/amd/pmc: Detect when STB is not available

Loading the amd_pmc module as:

    amd_pmc enable_stb=1

...can result in the following messages in the kernel ring buffer:

    amd_pmc AMDI0009:00: SMU cmd failed. err: 0xff
    ioremap on RAM at 0x0000000000000000 - 0x0000000000ffffff
    WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 2151 at arch/x86/mm/ioremap.c:217 __ioremap_caller+0x2cd/0x340

Further debugging reveals that this occurs when the requests for
S2D_PHYS_ADDR_LOW and S2D_PHYS_ADDR_HIGH return a value of 0,
indicating that the STB is inaccessible. To prevent the ioremap
warning and provide clarity to the user, handle the invalid address
and display an error message.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53072 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
