Subject: CVE-2024-53193: clk: clk-loongson2: Fix memory corruption bug in struct loongson2_clk_provider

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: clk-loongson2: Fix memory corruption bug in struct loongson2_clk_provider

Some heap space is allocated for the flexible structure `struct
clk_hw_onecell_data` and its flexible-array member `hws` through
the composite structure `struct loongson2_clk_provider` in function
`loongson2_clk_probe()`, as shown below:

289         struct loongson2_clk_provider *clp;
	...
296         for (p = data; p->name; p++)
297                 clks_num++;
298
299         clp = devm_kzalloc(dev, struct_size(clp, clk_data.hws, clks_num),
300                            GFP_KERNEL);

Then some data is written into the flexible array:

350                 clp->clk_data.hws[p->id] = hw;

This corrupts `clk_lock`, which is the spinlock variable immediately
following the `clk_data` member in `struct loongson2_clk_provider`:

struct loongson2_clk_provider {
	void __iomem *base;
	struct device *dev;
	struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;
	spinlock_t clk_lock;	/* protect access to DIV registers */
};

The problem is that the flexible structure is currently placed in the
middle of `struct loongson2_clk_provider` instead of at the end.

Fix this by moving `struct clk_hw_onecell_data clk_data;` to the end of
`struct loongson2_clk_provider`. Also, add a code comment to help
prevent this from happening again in case new members are added to the
structure in the future.

This change also fixes the following -Wflex-array-member-not-at-end
warning:

drivers/clk/clk-loongson2.c:32:36: warning: structure containing a flexible array member is not at the end of another structure [-Wflex-array-member-not-at-end]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53193 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/76918202615f2ba7deda14901d9fff528a180099
