Subject: CVE-2024-26716: usb: core: Prevent null pointer dereference in update_port_device_state

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: core: Prevent null pointer dereference in update_port_device_state

Currently, the function update_port_device_state gets the usb_hub from
udev->parent by calling usb_hub_to_struct_hub.
However, in case the actconfig or the maxchild is 0, the usb_hub would
be NULL and upon further accessing to get port_dev would result in null
pointer dereference.

Fix this by introducing an if check after the usb_hub is populated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26716 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
