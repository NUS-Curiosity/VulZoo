Subject: CVE-2024-27070: f2fs: fix to avoid use-after-free issue in f2fs_filemap_fault

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid use-after-free issue in f2fs_filemap_fault

syzbot reports a f2fs bug as below:

BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in f2fs_filemap_fault+0xd1/0x2c0 fs/f2fs/file.c:49

The root cause is: in f2fs_filemap_fault(), vmf->vma may be not alive after
filemap_fault(), so it may cause use-after-free issue when accessing
vmf->vma->vm_flags in trace_f2fs_filemap_fault(). So it needs to keep vm_flags
in separated temporary variable for tracepoint use.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27070 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8186e16a766d709a08f188d2f4e84098f364bea1
