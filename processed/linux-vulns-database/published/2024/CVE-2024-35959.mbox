Subject: CVE-2024-35959: net/mlx5e: Fix mlx5e_priv_init() cleanup flow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix mlx5e_priv_init() cleanup flow

When mlx5e_priv_init() fails, the cleanup flow calls mlx5e_selq_cleanup which
calls mlx5e_selq_apply() that assures that the `priv->state_lock` is held using
lockdep_is_held().

Acquire the state_lock in mlx5e_selq_cleanup().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
