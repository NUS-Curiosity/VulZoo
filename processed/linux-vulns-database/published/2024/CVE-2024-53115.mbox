Subject: CVE-2024-53115: drm/vmwgfx: avoid null_ptr_deref in vmw_framebuffer_surface_create_handle

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: avoid null_ptr_deref in vmw_framebuffer_surface_create_handle

The 'vmw_user_object_buffer' function may return NULL with incorrect
inputs. To avoid possible null pointer dereference, add a check whether
the 'bo' is NULL in the vmw_framebuffer_surface_create_handle.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53115 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
