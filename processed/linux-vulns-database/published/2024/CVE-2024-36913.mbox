Subject: CVE-2024-36913: Drivers: hv: vmbus: Leak pages if set_memory_encrypted() fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Drivers: hv: vmbus: Leak pages if set_memory_encrypted() fails

In CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause
set_memory_encrypted() or set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an
error is returned and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to
take care to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)
memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional or security
issues.

VMBus code could free decrypted pages if set_memory_encrypted()/decrypted()
fails. Leak the pages if this happens.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36913 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
