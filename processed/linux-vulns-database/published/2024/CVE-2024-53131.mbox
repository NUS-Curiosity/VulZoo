Subject: CVE-2024-53131: nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_touch_buffer tracepoint

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref in block_touch_buffer tracepoint

Patch series "nilfs2: fix null-ptr-deref bugs on block tracepoints".

This series fixes null pointer dereference bugs that occur when using
nilfs2 and two block-related tracepoints.


This patch (of 2):

It has been reported that when using "block:block_touch_buffer"
tracepoint, touch_buffer() called from __nilfs_get_folio_block() causes a
NULL pointer dereference, or a general protection fault when KASAN is
enabled.

This happens because since the tracepoint was added in touch_buffer(), it
references the dev_t member bh->b_bdev->bd_dev regardless of whether the
buffer head has a pointer to a block_device structure.  In the current
implementation, the block_device structure is set after the function
returns to the caller.

Here, touch_buffer() is used to mark the folio/page that owns the buffer
head as accessed, but the common search helper for folio/page used by the
caller function was optimized to mark the folio/page as accessed when it
was reimplemented a long time ago, eliminating the need to call
touch_buffer() here in the first place.

So this solves the issue by eliminating the touch_buffer() call itself.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53131 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
