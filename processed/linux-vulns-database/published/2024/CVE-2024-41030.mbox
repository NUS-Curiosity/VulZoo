Subject: CVE-2024-41030: ksmbd: discard write access to the directory open

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: discard write access to the directory open

may_open() does not allow a directory to be opened with the write access.
However, some writing flags set by client result in adding write access
on server, making ksmbd incompatible with FUSE file system. Simply, let's
discard the write access when opening a directory.

list_add corruption. next is NULL.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
