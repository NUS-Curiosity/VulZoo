Subject: CVE-2024-39472: xfs: fix log recovery buffer allocation for the legacy h_size fixup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: fix log recovery buffer allocation for the legacy h_size fixup

Commit a70f9fe52daa ("xfs: detect and handle invalid iclog size set by
mkfs") added a fixup for incorrect h_size values used for the initial
umount record in old xfsprogs versions.  Later commit 0c771b99d6c9
("xfs: clean up calculation of LR header blocks") cleaned up the log
reover buffer calculation, but stoped using the fixed up h_size value
to size the log recovery buffer, which can lead to an out of bounds
access when the incorrect h_size does not come from the old mkfs
tool, but a fuzzer.

Fix this by open coding xlog_logrec_hblks and taking the fixed h_size
into account for this calculation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39472 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
