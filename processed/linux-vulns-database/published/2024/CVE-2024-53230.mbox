Subject: CVE-2024-53230: cpufreq: CPPC: Fix possible null-ptr-deref for cppc_get_cpu_cost()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: CPPC: Fix possible null-ptr-deref for cppc_get_cpu_cost()

cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() may return NULL if the cpu is not in
policy->cpus cpu mask and it will cause null pointer dereference,
so check NULL for cppc_get_cpu_cost().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53230 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
