Subject: CVE-2024-36481: tracing/probes: fix error check in parse_btf_field()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/probes: fix error check in parse_btf_field()

btf_find_struct_member() might return NULL or an error via the
ERR_PTR() macro. However, its caller in parse_btf_field() only checks
for the NULL condition. Fix this by using IS_ERR() and returning the
error up the stack.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36481 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
