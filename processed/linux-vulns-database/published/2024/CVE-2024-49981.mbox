Subject: CVE-2024-49981: media: venus: fix use after free bug in venus_remove due to race condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: venus: fix use after free bug in venus_remove due to race condition

in venus_probe, core->work is bound with venus_sys_error_handler, which is
used to handle error. The code use core->sys_err_done to make sync work.
The core->work is started in venus_event_notify.

If we call venus_remove, there might be an unfished work. The possible
sequence is as follows:

CPU0                  CPU1

                     |venus_sys_error_handler
venus_remove         |
hfi_destroy	 		 |
venus_hfi_destroy	 |
kfree(hdev);	     |
                     |hfi_reinit
					 |venus_hfi_queues_reinit
                     |//use hdev

Fix it by canceling the work in venus_remove.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49981 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
