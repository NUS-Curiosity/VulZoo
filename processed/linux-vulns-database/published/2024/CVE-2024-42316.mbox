Subject: CVE-2024-42316: mm/mglru: fix div-by-zero in vmpressure_calc_level()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/mglru: fix div-by-zero in vmpressure_calc_level()

evict_folios() uses a second pass to reclaim folios that have gone through
page writeback and become clean before it finishes the first pass, since
folio_rotate_reclaimable() cannot handle those folios due to the
isolation.

The second pass tries to avoid potential double counting by deducting
scan_control->nr_scanned.  However, this can result in underflow of
nr_scanned, under a condition where shrink_folio_list() does not increment
nr_scanned, i.e., when folio_trylock() fails.

The underflow can cause the divisor, i.e., scale=scanned+reclaimed in
vmpressure_calc_level(), to become zero, resulting in the following crash:

  [exception RIP: vmpressure_work_fn+101]
  process_one_work at ffffffffa3313f2b

Since scan_control->nr_scanned has no established semantics, the potential
double counting has minimal risks.  Therefore, fix the problem by not
deducting scan_control->nr_scanned in evict_folios().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42316 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
