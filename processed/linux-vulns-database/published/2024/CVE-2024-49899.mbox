Subject: CVE-2024-49899: drm/amd/display: Initialize denominators' default to 1

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Initialize denominators' default to 1

[WHAT & HOW]
Variables used as denominators and maybe not assigned to other values,
should not be 0. Change their default to 1 so they are never 0.

This fixes 10 DIVIDE_BY_ZERO issues reported by Coverity.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49899 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
