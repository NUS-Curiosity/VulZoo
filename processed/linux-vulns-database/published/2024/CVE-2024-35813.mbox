Subject: CVE-2024-35813: mmc: core: Avoid negative index with array access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: core: Avoid negative index with array access

Commit 4d0c8d0aef63 ("mmc: core: Use mrq.sbc in close-ended ffu") assigns
prev_idata = idatas[i - 1], but doesn't check that the iterator i is
greater than zero. Let's fix this by adding a check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35813 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
