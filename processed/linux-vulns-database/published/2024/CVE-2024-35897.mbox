Subject: CVE-2024-35897: netfilter: nf_tables: discard table flag update with pending basechain deletion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: discard table flag update with pending basechain deletion

Hook unregistration is deferred to the commit phase, same occurs with
hook updates triggered by the table dormant flag. When both commands are
combined, this results in deleting a basechain while leaving its hook
still registered in the core.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35897 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
