Subject: CVE-2024-50198: iio: light: veml6030: fix IIO device retrieval from embedded device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: light: veml6030: fix IIO device retrieval from embedded device

The dev pointer that is received as an argument in the
in_illuminance_period_available_show function references the device
embedded in the IIO device, not in the i2c client.

dev_to_iio_dev() must be used to accessthe right data. The current
implementation leads to a segmentation fault on every attempt to read
the attribute because indio_dev gets a NULL assignment.

This bug has been present since the first appearance of the driver,
apparently since the last version (V6) before getting applied. A
constant attribute was used until then, and the last modifications might
have not been tested again.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50198 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
