Subject: CVE-2024-38587: speakup: Fix sizeof() vs ARRAY_SIZE() bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

speakup: Fix sizeof() vs ARRAY_SIZE() bug

The "buf" pointer is an array of u16 values.  This code should be
using ARRAY_SIZE() (which is 256) instead of sizeof() (which is 512),
otherwise it can the still got out of bounds.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
