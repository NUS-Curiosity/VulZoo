Subject: CVE-2024-35786: drm/nouveau: fix stale locked mutex in nouveau_gem_ioctl_pushbuf

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau: fix stale locked mutex in nouveau_gem_ioctl_pushbuf

If VM_BIND is enabled on the client the legacy submission ioctl can't be
used, however if a client tries to do so regardless it will return an
error. In this case the clients mutex remained unlocked leading to a
deadlock inside nouveau_drm_postclose or any other nouveau ioctl call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35786 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
