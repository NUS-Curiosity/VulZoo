Subject: CVE-2024-42079: gfs2: Fix NULL pointer dereference in gfs2_log_flush

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gfs2: Fix NULL pointer dereference in gfs2_log_flush

In gfs2_jindex_free(), set sdp->sd_jdesc to NULL under the log flush
lock to provide exclusion against gfs2_log_flush().

In gfs2_log_flush(), check if sdp->sd_jdesc is non-NULL before
dereferencing it.  Otherwise, we could run into a NULL pointer
dereference when outstanding glock work races with an unmount
(glock_work_func -> run_queue -> do_xmote -> inode_go_sync ->
gfs2_log_flush).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42079 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
