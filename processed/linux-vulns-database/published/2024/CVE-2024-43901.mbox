Subject: CVE-2024-43901: drm/amd/display: Fix NULL pointer dereference for DTN log in DCN401

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix NULL pointer dereference for DTN log in DCN401

When users run the command:

cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/amdgpu_dm_dtn_log

The following NULL pointer dereference happens:

This error happens when the color log tries to read the gamut remap
information from DCN401 which is not initialized in the dcn401_dpp_funcs
which leads to a null pointer dereference. This commit addresses this
issue by adding a proper guard to access the gamut_remap callback in
case the specific ASIC did not implement this function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43901 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1e68b7ce6bc6073579fe8713ec6b85aa9cd2e351
