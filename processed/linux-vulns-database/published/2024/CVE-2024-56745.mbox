Subject: CVE-2024-56745: PCI: Fix reset_method_store() memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: Fix reset_method_store() memory leak

In reset_method_store(), a string is allocated via kstrndup() and assigned
to the local "options". options is then used in with strsep() to find
spaces:

  while ((name = strsep(&options, " ")) != NULL) {

If there are no remaining spaces, then options is set to NULL by strsep(),
so the subsequent kfree(options) doesn't free the memory allocated via
kstrndup().

Fix by using a separate tmp_options to iterate with strsep() so options is
preserved.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56745 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
