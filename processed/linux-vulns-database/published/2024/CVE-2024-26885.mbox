Subject: CVE-2024-26885: bpf: Fix DEVMAP_HASH overflow check on 32-bit arches

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix DEVMAP_HASH overflow check on 32-bit arches

The devmap code allocates a number hash buckets equal to the next power
of two of the max_entries value provided when creating the map. When
rounding up to the next power of two, the 32-bit variable storing the
number of buckets can overflow, and the code checks for overflow by
checking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However, on 32-bit
arches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through, because it
ends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the
size of an unsigned long is four bytes, this is undefined behaviour, so
there is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at
the end.

Syzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a
DEVMAP_HASH with max_entries > 0x80000000 and then trying to update it.
Fix this by moving the overflow check to before the rounding up
operation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26885 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
