Subject: CVE-2024-26708: mptcp: really cope with fastopen race

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: really cope with fastopen race

Fastopen and PM-trigger subflow shutdown can race, as reported by
syzkaller.

In my first attempt to close such race, I missed the fact that
the subflow status can change again before the subflow_state_change
callback is invoked.

Address the issue additionally copying with all the states directly
reachable from TCP_FIN_WAIT1.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26708 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
