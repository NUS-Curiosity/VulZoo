Subject: CVE-2024-36925: swiotlb: initialise restricted pool list_head when SWIOTLB_DYNAMIC=y

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

swiotlb: initialise restricted pool list_head when SWIOTLB_DYNAMIC=y

Using restricted DMA pools (CONFIG_DMA_RESTRICTED_POOL=y) in conjunction
with dynamic SWIOTLB (CONFIG_SWIOTLB_DYNAMIC=y) leads to the following
crash when initialising the restricted pools at boot-time:

  | Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000008
  | Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
  | pc : rmem_swiotlb_device_init+0xfc/0x1ec
  | lr : rmem_swiotlb_device_init+0xf0/0x1ec
  | Call trace:
  |  rmem_swiotlb_device_init+0xfc/0x1ec
  |  of_reserved_mem_device_init_by_idx+0x18c/0x238
  |  of_dma_configure_id+0x31c/0x33c
  |  platform_dma_configure+0x34/0x80

faddr2line reveals that the crash is in the list validation code:

  include/linux/list.h:83
  include/linux/rculist.h:79
  include/linux/rculist.h:106
  kernel/dma/swiotlb.c:306
  kernel/dma/swiotlb.c:1695

because add_mem_pool() is trying to list_add_rcu() to a NULL
'mem->pools'.

Fix the crash by initialising the 'mem->pools' list_head in
rmem_swiotlb_device_init() before calling add_mem_pool().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36925 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
