Subject: CVE-2024-50111: LoongArch: Enable IRQ if do_ale() triggered in irq-enabled context

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Enable IRQ if do_ale() triggered in irq-enabled context

Unaligned access exception can be triggered in irq-enabled context such
as user mode, in this case do_ale() may call get_user() which may cause
sleep. Then we will get:

 BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at arch/loongarch/kernel/access-helper.h:7

So enable IRQ if unaligned access exception is triggered in irq-enabled
context to fix it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8915ed160dbd32b5ef5864df9a9fc11db83a77bb
