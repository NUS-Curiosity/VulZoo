Subject: CVE-2024-26702: iio: magnetometer: rm3100: add boundary check for the value read from RM3100_REG_TMRC

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: magnetometer: rm3100: add boundary check for the value read from RM3100_REG_TMRC

Recently, we encounter kernel crash in function rm3100_common_probe
caused by out of bound access of array rm3100_samp_rates (because of
underlying hardware failures). Add boundary check to prevent out of
bound access.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26702 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
