Subject: CVE-2024-27432: net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix PPE hanging issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: mtk_eth_soc: fix PPE hanging issue

A patch to resolve an issue was found in MediaTek's GPL-licensed SDK:
In the mtk_ppe_stop() function, the PPE scan mode is not disabled before
disabling the PPE. This can potentially lead to a hang during the process
of disabling the PPE.

Without this patch, the PPE may experience a hang during the reboot test.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27432 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
