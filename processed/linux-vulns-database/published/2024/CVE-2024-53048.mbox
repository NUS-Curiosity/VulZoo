Subject: CVE-2024-53048: ice: fix crash on probe for DPLL enabled E810 LOM

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix crash on probe for DPLL enabled E810 LOM

The E810 Lan On Motherboard (LOM) design is vendor specific. Intel
provides the reference design, but it is up to vendor on the final
product design. For some cases, like Linux DPLL support, the static
values defined in the driver does not reflect the actual LOM design.
Current implementation of dpll pins is causing the crash on probe
of the ice driver for such DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs:

WARNING: (...) at drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c:495 dpll_pin_get+0x2c4/0x330
...
Call Trace:

 ice_dpll_get_pins.isra.0+0x52/0xe0 [ice]
...

The number of dpll pins enabled by LOM vendor is greater than expected
and defined in the driver for Intel designed NICs, which causes the crash.

Prevent the crash and allow generic pin initialization within Linux DPLL
subsystem for DPLL enabled E810 LOM designs.

Newly designed solution for described issue will be based on "per HW
design" pin initialization. It requires pin information dynamically
acquired from the firmware and is already in progress, planned for
next-tree only.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53048 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
