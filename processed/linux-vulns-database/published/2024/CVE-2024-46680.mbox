Subject: CVE-2024-46680: Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Fix random crash seen while removing driver

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Fix random crash seen while removing driver

This fixes the random kernel crash seen while removing the driver, when
running the load/unload test over multiple iterations.

1) modprobe btnxpuart
2) hciconfig hci0 reset
3) hciconfig (check hci0 interface up with valid BD address)
4) modprobe -r btnxpuart
Repeat steps 1 to 4

The ps_wakeup() call in btnxpuart_close() schedules the psdata->work(),
which gets scheduled after module is removed, causing a kernel crash.

This hidden issue got highlighted after enabling Power Save by default
in 4183a7be7700 (Bluetooth: btnxpuart: Enable Power Save feature on
startup)

The new ps_cleanup() deasserts UART break immediately while closing
serdev device, cancels any scheduled ps_work and destroys the ps_lock
mutex.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
