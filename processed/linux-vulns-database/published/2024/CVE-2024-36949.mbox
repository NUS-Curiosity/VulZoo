Subject: CVE-2024-36949: amd/amdkfd: sync all devices to wait all processes being evicted

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

amd/amdkfd: sync all devices to wait all processes being evicted

If there are more than one device doing reset in parallel, the first
device will call kfd_suspend_all_processes() to evict all processes
on all devices, this call takes time to finish. other device will
start reset and recover without waiting. if the process has not been
evicted before doing recover, it will be restored, then caused page
fault.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36949 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
