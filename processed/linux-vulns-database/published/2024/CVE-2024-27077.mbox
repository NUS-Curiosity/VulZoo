Subject: CVE-2024-27077: media: v4l2-mem2mem: fix a memleak in v4l2_m2m_register_entity

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: v4l2-mem2mem: fix a memleak in v4l2_m2m_register_entity

The entity->name (i.e. name) is allocated in v4l2_m2m_register_entity
but isn't freed in its following error-handling paths. This patch
adds such deallocation to prevent memleak of entity->name.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27077 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
