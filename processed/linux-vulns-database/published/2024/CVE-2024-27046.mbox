Subject: CVE-2024-27046: nfp: flower: handle acti_netdevs allocation failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfp: flower: handle acti_netdevs allocation failure

The kmalloc_array() in nfp_fl_lag_do_work() will return null, if
the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we dereference
the acti_netdevs, the null pointer dereference bugs will happen.

This patch adds a check to judge whether allocation failure occurs.
If it happens, the delayed work will be rescheduled and try again.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27046 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
