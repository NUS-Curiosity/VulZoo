Subject: CVE-2024-56575: media: imx-jpeg: Ensure power suppliers be suspended before detach them

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: imx-jpeg: Ensure power suppliers be suspended before detach them

The power suppliers are always requested to suspend asynchronously,
dev_pm_domain_detach() requires the caller to ensure proper
synchronization of this function with power management callbacks.
otherwise the detach may led to kernel panic, like below:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
