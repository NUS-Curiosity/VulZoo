Subject: CVE-2024-38577: rcu-tasks: Fix show_rcu_tasks_trace_gp_kthread buffer overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu-tasks: Fix show_rcu_tasks_trace_gp_kthread buffer overflow

There is a possibility of buffer overflow in
show_rcu_tasks_trace_gp_kthread() if counters, passed
to sprintf() are huge. Counter numbers, needed for this
are unrealistically high, but buffer overflow is still
possible.

Use snprintf() with buffer size instead of sprintf().

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38577 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
