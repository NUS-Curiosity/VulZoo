Subject: CVE-2024-26622: tomoyo: fix UAF write bug in tomoyo_write_control()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tomoyo: fix UAF write bug in tomoyo_write_control()

Since tomoyo_write_control() updates head->write_buf when write()
of long lines is requested, we need to fetch head->write_buf after
head->io_sem is held.  Otherwise, concurrent write() requests can
cause use-after-free-write and double-free problems.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26622 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
