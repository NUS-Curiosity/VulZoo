Subject: CVE-2024-46718: drm/xe: Don't overmap identity VRAM mapping

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Don't overmap identity VRAM mapping

Overmapping the identity VRAM mapping is triggering hardware bugs on
certain platforms. Use 2M pages for the last unaligned (to 1G) VRAM
chunk.

v2:
 - Always use 2M pages for last chunk (Fei Yang)
 - break loop when 2M pages are used
 - Add assert for usable_size being 2M aligned
v3:
 - Fix checkpatch

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46718 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bb706e92c87beb9f2543faa1705ccc330b9e7c65
