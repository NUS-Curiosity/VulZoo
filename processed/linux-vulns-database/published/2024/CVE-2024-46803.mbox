Subject: CVE-2024-46803: drm/amdkfd: Check debug trap enable before write dbg_ev_file

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Check debug trap enable before write dbg_ev_file

In interrupt context, write dbg_ev_file will be run by work queue. It
will cause write dbg_ev_file execution after debug_trap_disable, which
will cause NULL pointer access.
v2: cancel work "debug_event_workarea" before set dbg_ev_file as NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46803 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
