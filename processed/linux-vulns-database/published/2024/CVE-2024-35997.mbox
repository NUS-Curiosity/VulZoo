Subject: CVE-2024-35997: HID: i2c-hid: remove I2C_HID_READ_PENDING flag to prevent lock-up

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: i2c-hid: remove I2C_HID_READ_PENDING flag to prevent lock-up

The flag I2C_HID_READ_PENDING is used to serialize I2C operations.
However, this is not necessary, because I2C core already has its own
locking for that.

More importantly, this flag can cause a lock-up: if the flag is set in
i2c_hid_xfer() and an interrupt happens, the interrupt handler
(i2c_hid_irq) will check this flag and return immediately without doing
anything, then the interrupt handler will be invoked again in an
infinite loop.

Since interrupt handler is an RT task, it takes over the CPU and the
flag-clearing task never gets scheduled, thus we have a lock-up.

Delete this unnecessary flag.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35997 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
