Subject: CVE-2024-56539: wifi: mwifiex: Fix memcpy() field-spanning write warning in mwifiex_config_scan()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mwifiex: Fix memcpy() field-spanning write warning in mwifiex_config_scan()

Replace one-element array with a flexible-array member in `struct
mwifiex_ie_types_wildcard_ssid_params` to fix the following warning
on a MT8173 Chromebook (mt8173-elm-hana):

[  356.775250] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[  356.784543] memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 6) of single field "wildcard_ssid_tlv->ssid" at drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/scan.c:904 (size 1)
[  356.813403] WARNING: CPU: 3 PID: 742 at drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/scan.c:904 mwifiex_scan_networks+0x4fc/0xf28 [mwifiex]

The "(size 6)" above is exactly the length of the SSID of the network
this device was connected to. The source of the warning looks like:

    ssid_len = user_scan_in->ssid_list[i].ssid_len;
    [...]
    memcpy(wildcard_ssid_tlv->ssid,
           user_scan_in->ssid_list[i].ssid, ssid_len);

There is a #define WILDCARD_SSID_TLV_MAX_SIZE that uses sizeof() on this
struct, but it already didn't account for the size of the one-element
array, so it doesn't need to be changed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56539 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
