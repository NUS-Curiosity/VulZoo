Subject: CVE-2024-57798: drm/dp_mst: Ensure mst_primary pointer is valid in drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/dp_mst: Ensure mst_primary pointer is valid in drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req()

While receiving an MST up request message from one thread in
drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(), the MST topology could be removed from
another thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), freeing
mst_primary and setting drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::mst_primary to NULL.
This could lead to a NULL deref/use-after-free of mst_primary in
drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req().

Avoid the above by holding a reference for mst_primary in
drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req() while it's used.

v2: Fix kfreeing the request if getting an mst_primary reference fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57798 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
