Subject: CVE-2024-42282: net: mediatek: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dummy net_device handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mediatek: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dummy net_device handling

Move the freeing of the dummy net_device from mtk_free_dev() to
mtk_remove().

Previously, if alloc_netdev_dummy() failed in mtk_probe(),
eth->dummy_dev would be NULL. The error path would then call
mtk_free_dev(), which in turn called free_netdev() assuming dummy_dev
was allocated (but it was not), potentially causing a NULL pointer
dereference.

By moving free_netdev() to mtk_remove(), we ensure it's only called when
mtk_probe() has succeeded and dummy_dev is fully allocated. This
addresses a potential NULL pointer dereference detected by Smatch[1].

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42282 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/ethernet/mediatek/mtk_eth_soc.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/af6bd5c9901b13a26eaf4d57d97a813297791596
