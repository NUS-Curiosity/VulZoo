Subject: CVE-2024-41056: firmware: cs_dsp: Use strnlen() on name fields in V1 wmfw files

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Use strnlen() on name fields in V1 wmfw files

Use strnlen() instead of strlen() on the algorithm and coefficient name
string arrays in V1 wmfw files.

In V1 wmfw files the name is a NUL-terminated string in a fixed-size
array. cs_dsp should protect against overrunning the array if the NUL
terminator is missing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41056 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
