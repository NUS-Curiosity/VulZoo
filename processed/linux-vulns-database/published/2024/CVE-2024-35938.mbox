Subject: CVE-2024-35938: wifi: ath11k: decrease MHI channel buffer length to 8KB

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: decrease MHI channel buffer length to 8KB

Currently buf_len field of ath11k_mhi_config_qca6390 is assigned
with 0, making MHI use a default size, 64KB, to allocate channel
buffers. This is likely to fail in some scenarios where system
memory is highly fragmented and memory compaction or reclaim is
not allowed.

There is a fail report which is caused by it:
kworker/u32:45: page allocation failure: order:4, mode:0x40c00(GFP_NOIO|__GFP_COMP), nodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0

Actually those buffers are used only by QMI target -> host communication.
And for WCN6855 and QCA6390, the largest packet size for that is less
than 6KB. So change buf_len field to 8KB, which results in order 1
allocation if page size is 4KB. In this way, we can at least save some
memory, and as well as decrease the possibility of allocation failure
in those scenarios.

Tested-on: WCN6855 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HSP.1.1-03125-QCAHSPSWPL_V1_V2_SILICONZ_LITE-3.6510.30

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
