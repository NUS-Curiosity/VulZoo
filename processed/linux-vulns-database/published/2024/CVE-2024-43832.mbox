Subject: CVE-2024-43832: s390/uv: Don't call folio_wait_writeback() without a folio reference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/uv: Don't call folio_wait_writeback() without a folio reference

folio_wait_writeback() requires that no spinlocks are held and that
a folio reference is held, as documented. After we dropped the PTL, the
folio could get freed concurrently. So grab a temporary reference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43832 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
