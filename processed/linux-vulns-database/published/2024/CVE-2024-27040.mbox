Subject: CVE-2024-27040: drm/amd/display: Add 'replay' NULL check in 'edp_set_replay_allow_active()'

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add 'replay' NULL check in 'edp_set_replay_allow_active()'

In the first if statement, we're checking if 'replay' is NULL. But in
the second if statement, we're not checking if 'replay' is NULL again
before calling replay->funcs->replay_set_power_opt().

if (replay == NULL && force_static)
    return false;

...

if (link->replay_settings.replay_feature_enabled &&
    replay->funcs->replay_set_power_opt) {
	replay->funcs->replay_set_power_opt(replay, *power_opts, panel_inst);
	link->replay_settings.replay_power_opt_active = *power_opts;
}

If 'replay' is NULL, this will cause a null pointer dereference.

Fixes the below found by smatch:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/link/protocols/link_edp_panel_control.c:895 edp_set_replay_allow_active() error: we previously assumed 'replay' could be null (see line 887)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27040 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
