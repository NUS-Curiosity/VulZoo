Subject: CVE-2024-56720: bpf, sockmap: Several fixes to bpf_msg_pop_data

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Several fixes to bpf_msg_pop_data

Several fixes to bpf_msg_pop_data,
1. In sk_msg_shift_left, we should put_page
2. if (len == 0), return early is better
3. pop the entire sk_msg (last == msg->sg.size) should be supported
4. Fix for the value of variable "a"
5. In sk_msg_shift_left, after shifting, i has already pointed to the next
element. Addtional sk_msg_iter_var_next may result in BUG.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56720 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
