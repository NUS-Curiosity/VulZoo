Subject: CVE-2024-42126: powerpc: Avoid nmi_enter/nmi_exit in real mode interrupt.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc: Avoid nmi_enter/nmi_exit in real mode interrupt.

nmi_enter()/nmi_exit() touches per cpu variables which can lead to kernel
crash when invoked during real mode interrupt handling (e.g. early HMI/MCE
interrupt handler) if percpu allocation comes from vmalloc area.

Early HMI/MCE handlers are called through DEFINE_INTERRUPT_HANDLER_NMI()
wrapper which invokes nmi_enter/nmi_exit calls. We don't see any issue when
percpu allocation is from the embedded first chunk. However with
CONFIG_NEED_PER_CPU_PAGE_FIRST_CHUNK enabled there are chances where percpu
allocation can come from the vmalloc area.

With kernel command line "percpu_alloc=page" we can force percpu allocation
to come from vmalloc area and can see kernel crash in machine_check_early:

[    1.215717] LR [c0000000000461a0] machine_check_early+0xf0/0x2c0

Fix this by avoiding use of nmi_enter()/nmi_exit() in real mode if percpu
first chunk is not embedded.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42126 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
