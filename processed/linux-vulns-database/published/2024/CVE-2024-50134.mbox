Subject: CVE-2024-50134: drm/vboxvideo: Replace fake VLA at end of vbva_mouse_pointer_shape with real VLA

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vboxvideo: Replace fake VLA at end of vbva_mouse_pointer_shape with real VLA

Replace the fake VLA at end of the vbva_mouse_pointer_shape shape with
a real VLA to fix a "memcpy: detected field-spanning write error" warning:

[   13.319813] memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 16896) of single field "p->data" at drivers/gpu/drm/vboxvideo/hgsmi_base.c:154 (size 4)
[   13.319841] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1105 at drivers/gpu/drm/vboxvideo/hgsmi_base.c:154 hgsmi_update_pointer_shape+0x192/0x1c0 [vboxvideo]
[   13.320038] Call Trace:
[   13.320173]  hgsmi_update_pointer_shape [vboxvideo]
[   13.320184]  vbox_cursor_atomic_update [vboxvideo]

Note as mentioned in the added comment it seems the original length
calculation for the allocated and send hgsmi buffer is 4 bytes too large.
Changing this is not the goal of this patch, so this behavior is kept.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50134 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
