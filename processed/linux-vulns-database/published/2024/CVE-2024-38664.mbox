Subject: CVE-2024-38664: drm: zynqmp_dpsub: Always register bridge

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: zynqmp_dpsub: Always register bridge

We must always register the DRM bridge, since zynqmp_dp_hpd_work_func
calls drm_bridge_hpd_notify, which in turn expects hpd_mutex to be
initialized. We do this before zynqmp_dpsub_drm_init since that calls
drm_bridge_attach. This fixes the following lockdep warning:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
