Subject: CVE-2024-26769: nvmet-fc: avoid deadlock on delete association path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet-fc: avoid deadlock on delete association path

When deleting an association the shutdown path is deadlocking because we
try to flush the nvmet_wq nested. Avoid this by deadlock by deferring
the put work into its own work item.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26769 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
