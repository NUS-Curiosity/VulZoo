Subject: CVE-2024-46736: smb: client: fix double put of @cfile in smb2_rename_path()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix double put of @cfile in smb2_rename_path()

If smb2_set_path_attr() is called with a valid @cfile and returned
-EINVAL, we need to call cifs_get_writable_path() again as the
reference of @cfile was already dropped by previous smb2_compound_op()
call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46736 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
