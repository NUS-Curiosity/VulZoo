Subject: CVE-2024-56605: Bluetooth: L2CAP: do not leave dangling sk pointer on error in l2cap_sock_create()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: L2CAP: do not leave dangling sk pointer on error in l2cap_sock_create()

bt_sock_alloc() allocates the sk object and attaches it to the provided
sock object. On error l2cap_sock_alloc() frees the sk object, but the
dangling pointer is still attached to the sock object, which may create
use-after-free in other code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56605 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
