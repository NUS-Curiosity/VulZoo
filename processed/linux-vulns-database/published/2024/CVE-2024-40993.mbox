Subject: CVE-2024-40993: netfilter: ipset: Fix suspicious rcu_dereference_protected()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: Fix suspicious rcu_dereference_protected()

When destroying all sets, we are either in pernet exit phase or
are executing a "destroy all sets command" from userspace. The latter
was taken into account in ip_set_dereference() (nfnetlink mutex is held),
but the former was not. The patch adds the required check to
rcu_dereference_protected() in ip_set_dereference().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40993 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
