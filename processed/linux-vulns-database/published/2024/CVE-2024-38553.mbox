Subject: CVE-2024-38553: net: fec: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fec: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid deadlocks

There is a deadlock issue found in sungem driver, please refer to the
commit ac0a230f719b ("eth: sungem: remove .ndo_poll_controller to avoid
deadlocks"). The root cause of the issue is that netpoll is in atomic
context and disable_irq() is called by .ndo_poll_controller interface
of sungem driver, however, disable_irq() might sleep. After analyzing
the implementation of fec_poll_controller(), the fec driver should have
the same issue. Due to the fec driver uses NAPI for TX completions, the
.ndo_poll_controller is unnecessary to be implemented in the fec driver,
so fec_poll_controller() can be safely removed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38553 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
