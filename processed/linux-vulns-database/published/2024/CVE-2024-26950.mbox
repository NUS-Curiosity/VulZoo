Subject: CVE-2024-26950: wireguard: netlink: access device through ctx instead of peer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wireguard: netlink: access device through ctx instead of peer

The previous commit fixed a bug that led to a NULL peer->device being
dereferenced. It's actually easier and faster performance-wise to
instead get the device from ctx->wg. This semantically makes more sense
too, since ctx->wg->peer_allowedips.seq is compared with
ctx->allowedips_seq, basing them both in ctx. This also acts as a
defence in depth provision against freed peers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26950 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
