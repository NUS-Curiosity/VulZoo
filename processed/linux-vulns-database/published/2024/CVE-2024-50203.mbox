Subject: CVE-2024-50203: bpf, arm64: Fix address emission with tag-based KASAN enabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, arm64: Fix address emission with tag-based KASAN enabled

When BPF_TRAMP_F_CALL_ORIG is enabled, the address of a bpf_tramp_image
struct on the stack is passed during the size calculation pass and
an address on the heap is passed during code generation. This may
cause a heap buffer overflow if the heap address is tagged because
emit_a64_mov_i64() will emit longer code than it did during the size
calculation pass. The same problem could occur without tag-based
KASAN if one of the 16-bit words of the stack address happened to
be all-ones during the size calculation pass. Fix the problem by
assuming the worst case (4 instructions) when calculating the size
of the bpf_tramp_image address emission.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50203 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7db1a2121f3c7903b8e397392beec563c3d00950
