Subject: CVE-2024-50105: ASoC: qcom: sc7280: Fix missing Soundwire runtime stream alloc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: qcom: sc7280: Fix missing Soundwire runtime stream alloc

Commit 15c7fab0e047 ("ASoC: qcom: Move Soundwire runtime stream alloc to
soundcards") moved the allocation of Soundwire stream runtime from the
Qualcomm Soundwire driver to each individual machine sound card driver,
except that it forgot to update SC7280 card.

Just like for other Qualcomm sound cards using Soundwire, the card
driver should allocate and release the runtime.  Otherwise sound
playback will result in a NULL pointer dereference or other effect of
uninitialized memory accesses (which was confirmed on SDM845 having
similar issue).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50105 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/176a41ebec42a921277cd34e8c0c2e776a9dd6c4
