Subject: CVE-2024-40903: usb: typec: tcpm: fix use-after-free case in tcpm_register_source_caps

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: tcpm: fix use-after-free case in tcpm_register_source_caps

There could be a potential use-after-free case in
tcpm_register_source_caps(). This could happen when:
 * new (say invalid) source caps are advertised
 * the existing source caps are unregistered
 * tcpm_register_source_caps() returns with an error as
   usb_power_delivery_register_capabilities() fails

This causes port->partner_source_caps to hold on to the now freed source
caps.

Reset port->partner_source_caps value to NULL after unregistering
existing source caps.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40903 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
