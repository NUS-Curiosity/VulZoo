Subject: CVE-2024-41035: USB: core: Fix duplicate endpoint bug by clearing reserved bits in the descriptor

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: core: Fix duplicate endpoint bug by clearing reserved bits in the descriptor

Syzbot has identified a bug in usbcore (see the Closes: tag below)
caused by our assumption that the reserved bits in an endpoint
descriptor's bEndpointAddress field will always be 0.  As a result of
the bug, the endpoint_is_duplicate() routine in config.c (and possibly
other routines as well) may believe that two descriptors are for
distinct endpoints, even though they have the same direction and
endpoint number.  This can lead to confusion, including the bug
identified by syzbot (two descriptors with matching endpoint numbers
and directions, where one was interrupt and the other was bulk).

To fix the bug, we will clear the reserved bits in bEndpointAddress
when we parse the descriptor.  (Note that both the USB-2.0 and USB-3.1
specs say these bits are "Reserved, reset to zero".)  This requires us
to make a copy of the descriptor earlier in usb_parse_endpoint() and
use the copy instead of the original when checking for duplicates.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41035 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
