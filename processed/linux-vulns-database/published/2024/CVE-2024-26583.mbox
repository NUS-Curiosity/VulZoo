Subject: CVE-2024-26583: tls: fix race between async notify and socket close

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: fix race between async notify and socket close

The submitting thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg)
may exit as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete()
so any code past that point risks touching already freed data.

Try to avoid the locking and extra flags altogether.
Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this way
we can depend solely on the atomic ref counter for
synchronization.

Don't futz with reiniting the completion, either, we are now
tightly controlling when completion fires.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26583 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
