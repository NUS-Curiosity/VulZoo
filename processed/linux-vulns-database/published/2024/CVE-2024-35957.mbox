Subject: CVE-2024-35957: iommu/vt-d: Fix WARN_ON in iommu probe path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix WARN_ON in iommu probe path

Commit 1a75cc710b95 ("iommu/vt-d: Use rbtree to track iommu probed
devices") adds all devices probed by the iommu driver in a rbtree
indexed by the source ID of each device. It assumes that each device
has a unique source ID. This assumption is incorrect and the VT-d
spec doesn't state this requirement either.

The reason for using a rbtree to track devices is to look up the device
with PCI bus and devfunc in the paths of handling ATS invalidation time
out error and the PRI I/O page faults. Both are PCI ATS feature related.

Only track the devices that have PCI ATS capabilities in the rbtree to
avoid unnecessary WARN_ON in the iommu probe path. Otherwise, on some
platforms below kernel splat will be displayed and the iommu probe results
in failure.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fba8ca3e6f608b92e54271fdbd3ce569361939fc
