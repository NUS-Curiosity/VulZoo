Subject: CVE-2024-56721: x86/CPU/AMD: Terminate the erratum_1386_microcode array

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/CPU/AMD: Terminate the erratum_1386_microcode array

The erratum_1386_microcode array requires an empty entry at the end.
Otherwise x86_match_cpu_with_stepping() will continue iterate the array after
it ended.

Add an empty entry to erratum_1386_microcode to its end.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56721 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
