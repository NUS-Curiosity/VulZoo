Subject: CVE-2024-50092: net: netconsole: fix wrong warning

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: netconsole: fix wrong warning

A warning is triggered when there is insufficient space in the buffer
for userdata. However, this is not an issue since userdata will be sent
in the next iteration.

Current warning message:

    ------------[ cut here ]------------
     WARNING: CPU: 13 PID: 3013042 at drivers/net/netconsole.c:1122 write_ext_msg+0x3b6/0x3d0
      ? write_ext_msg+0x3b6/0x3d0
      console_flush_all+0x1e9/0x330

The code incorrectly issues a warning when this_chunk is zero, which is
a valid scenario. The warning should only be triggered when this_chunk
is negative.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50092 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
