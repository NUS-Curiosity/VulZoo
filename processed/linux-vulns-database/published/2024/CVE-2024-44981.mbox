 | Kernel panic - not syncing: UBSAN: integer subtraction overflow: Fatal exception

This is due to shift_and_mask() using a signed immediate to construct
the mask and being called with a shift of 31 (WORK_OFFQ_POOL_SHIFT) so
that it ends up decrementing from INT_MIN.

Use an unsigned constant '1U' to generate the mask in shift_and_mask().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44981 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/90a6a844b2d9927d192758438a4ada33d8cd9de5
