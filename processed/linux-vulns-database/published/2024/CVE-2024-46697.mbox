Subject: CVE-2024-46697: nfsd: ensure that nfsd4_fattr_args.context is zeroed out

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: ensure that nfsd4_fattr_args.context is zeroed out

If nfsd4_encode_fattr4 ends up doing a "goto out" before we get to
checking for the security label, then args.context will be set to
uninitialized junk on the stack, which we'll then try to free.
Initialize it early.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46697 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dd65b324174a64558a16ebbf4c3266e5701185d0
