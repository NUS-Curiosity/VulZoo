Subject: CVE-2024-57936: RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix max SGEs for the Work Request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix max SGEs for the Work Request

Gen P7 supports up to 13 SGEs for now. WQE software structure
can hold only 6 now. Since the max send sge is reported as
13, the stack can give requests up to 13 SGEs. This is causing
traffic failures and system crashes.

Use the define for max SGE supported for variable size. This
will work for both static and variable WQEs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57936 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
