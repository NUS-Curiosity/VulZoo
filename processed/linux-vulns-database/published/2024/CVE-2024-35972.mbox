Subject: CVE-2024-35972: bnxt_en: Fix possible memory leak in bnxt_rdma_aux_device_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Fix possible memory leak in bnxt_rdma_aux_device_init()

If ulp = kzalloc() fails, the allocated edev will leak because it is
not properly assigned and the cleanup path will not be able to free it.
Fix it by assigning it properly immediately after allocation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35972 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
