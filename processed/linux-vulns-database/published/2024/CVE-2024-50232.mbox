Subject: CVE-2024-50232: iio: adc: ad7124: fix division by zero in ad7124_set_channel_odr()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: ad7124: fix division by zero in ad7124_set_channel_odr()

In the ad7124_write_raw() function, parameter val can potentially
be zero. This may lead to a division by zero when DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST()
is called within ad7124_set_channel_odr(). The ad7124_write_raw()
function is invoked through the sequence: iio_write_channel_raw() ->
iio_write_channel_attribute() -> iio_channel_write(), with no checks
in place to ensure val is non-zero.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50232 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
