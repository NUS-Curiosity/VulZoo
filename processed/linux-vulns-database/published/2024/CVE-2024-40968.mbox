Subject: CVE-2024-40968: MIPS: Octeon: Add PCIe link status check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

MIPS: Octeon: Add PCIe link status check

The standard PCIe configuration read-write interface is used to
access the configuration space of the peripheral PCIe devices
of the mips processor after the PCIe link surprise down, it can
generate kernel panic caused by "Data bus error". So it is
necessary to add PCIe link status check for system protection.
When the PCIe link is down or in training, assigning a value
of 0 to the configuration address can prevent read-write behavior
to the configuration space of peripheral PCIe devices, thereby
preventing kernel panic.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40968 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
