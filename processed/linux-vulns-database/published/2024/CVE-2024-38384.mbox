Subject: CVE-2024-38384: blk-cgroup: fix list corruption from reorder of WRITE ->lqueued

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-cgroup: fix list corruption from reorder of WRITE ->lqueued

__blkcg_rstat_flush() can be run anytime, especially when blk_cgroup_bio_start
is being executed.

If WRITE of `->lqueued` is re-ordered with READ of 'bisc->lnode.next' in
the loop of __blkcg_rstat_flush(), `next_bisc` can be assigned with one
stat instance being added in blk_cgroup_bio_start(), then the local
list in __blkcg_rstat_flush() could be corrupted.

Fix the issue by adding one barrier.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38384 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
