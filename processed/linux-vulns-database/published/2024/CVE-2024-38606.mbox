Subject: CVE-2024-38606: crypto: qat - validate slices count returned by FW

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: qat - validate slices count returned by FW

The function adf_send_admin_tl_start() enables the telemetry (TL)
feature on a QAT device by sending the ICP_QAT_FW_TL_START message to
the firmware. This triggers the FW to start writing TL data to a DMA
buffer in memory and returns an array containing the number of
accelerators of each type (slices) supported by this HW.
The pointer to this array is stored in the adf_tl_hw_data data
structure called slice_cnt.

The array slice_cnt is then used in the function tl_print_dev_data()
to report in debugfs only statistics about the supported accelerators.
An incorrect value of the elements in slice_cnt might lead to an out
of bounds memory read.
At the moment, there isn't an implementation of FW that returns a wrong
value, but for robustness validate the slice count array returned by FW.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38606 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
