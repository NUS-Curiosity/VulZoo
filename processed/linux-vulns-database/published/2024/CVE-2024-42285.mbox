Subject: CVE-2024-42285: RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to destroying CM IDs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to destroying CM IDs

iw_conn_req_handler() associates a new struct rdma_id_private (conn_id) with
an existing struct iw_cm_id (cm_id) as follows:

        conn_id->cm_id.iw = cm_id;
        cm_id->context = conn_id;
        cm_id->cm_handler = cma_iw_handler;

rdma_destroy_id() frees both the cm_id and the struct rdma_id_private. Make
sure that cm_work_handler() does not trigger a use-after-free by only
freeing of the struct rdma_id_private after all pending work has finished.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42285 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
