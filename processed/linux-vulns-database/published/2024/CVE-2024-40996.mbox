Subject: CVE-2024-40996: bpf: Avoid splat in pskb_pull_reason

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Avoid splat in pskb_pull_reason

syzkaller builds (CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=y) frequently trigger a debug
hint in pskb_may_pull.

We'd like to retain this debug check because it might hint at integer
overflows and other issues (kernel code should pull headers, not huge
value).

In bpf case, this splat isn't interesting at all: such (nonsensical)
bpf programs are typically generated by a fuzzer anyway.

Do what Eric suggested and suppress such warning.

For CONFIG_DEBUG_NET=n we don't need the extra check because
pskb_may_pull will do the right thing: return an error without the
WARN() backtrace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40996 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
