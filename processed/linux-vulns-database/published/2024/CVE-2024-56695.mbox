Subject: CVE-2024-56695: drm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()'

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: Use dynamic allocation for CU occupancy array in 'kfd_get_cu_occupancy()'

The `kfd_get_cu_occupancy` function previously declared a large
`cu_occupancy` array as a local variable, which could lead to stack
overflows due to excessive stack usage. This commit replaces the static
array allocation with dynamic memory allocation using `kcalloc`,
thereby reducing the stack size.

This change avoids the risk of stack overflows in kernel space,  in
scenarios where `AMDGPU_MAX_QUEUES` is large. The  allocated memory is
freed using `kfree` before the function returns  to prevent memory
leaks.

Fixes the below with gcc W=1:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c: In function ‘kfd_get_cu_occupancy’:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../amdkfd/kfd_process.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 1056 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6d9f07196389f35a3afebcf1a12c1425725caddd
