Subject: CVE-2024-53126: vdpa: solidrun: Fix UB bug with devres

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vdpa: solidrun: Fix UB bug with devres

In psnet_open_pf_bar() and snet_open_vf_bar() a string later passed to
pcim_iomap_regions() is placed on the stack. Neither
pcim_iomap_regions() nor the functions it calls copy that string.

Should the string later ever be used, this, consequently, causes
undefined behavior since the stack frame will by then have disappeared.

Fix the bug by allocating the strings on the heap through
devm_kasprintf().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53126 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
