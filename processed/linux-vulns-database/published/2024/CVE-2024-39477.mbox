Subject: CVE-2024-39477: mm/hugetlb: do not call vma_add_reservation upon ENOMEM

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb: do not call vma_add_reservation upon ENOMEM

sysbot reported a splat [1] on __unmap_hugepage_range().  This is because
vma_needs_reservation() can return -ENOMEM if
allocate_file_region_entries() fails to allocate the file_region struct
for the reservation.

Check for that and do not call vma_add_reservation() if that is the case,
otherwise region_abort() and region_del() will see that we do not have any
file_regions.

If we detect that vma_needs_reservation() returned -ENOMEM, we clear the
hugetlb_restore_reserve flag as if this reservation was still consumed, so
free_huge_folio() will not increment the resv count.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/aa998f9dcb34c28448f86e8f5490f20d5eb0eac7
