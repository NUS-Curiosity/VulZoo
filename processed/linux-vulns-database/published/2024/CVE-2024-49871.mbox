Subject: CVE-2024-49871: Input: adp5589-keys - fix NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Input: adp5589-keys - fix NULL pointer dereference

We register a devm action to call adp5589_clear_config() and then pass
the i2c client as argument so that we can call i2c_get_clientdata() in
order to get our device object. However, i2c_set_clientdata() is only
being set at the end of the probe function which means that we'll get a
NULL pointer dereference in case the probe function fails early.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49871 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
