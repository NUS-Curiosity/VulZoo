Subject: CVE-2024-38541: of: module: add buffer overflow check in of_modalias()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

of: module: add buffer overflow check in of_modalias()

In of_modalias(), if the buffer happens to be too small even for the 1st
snprintf() call, the len parameter will become negative and str parameter
(if not NULL initially) will point beyond the buffer's end. Add the buffer
overflow check after the 1st snprintf() call and fix such check after the
strlen() call (accounting for the terminating NUL char).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38541 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
