Subject: CVE-2024-43846: lib: objagg: Fix general protection fault

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib: objagg: Fix general protection fault

The library supports aggregation of objects into other objects only if
the parent object does not have a parent itself. That is, nesting is not
supported.

Aggregation happens in two cases: Without and with hints, where hints
are a pre-computed recommendation on how to aggregate the provided
objects.

Nesting is not possible in the first case due to a check that prevents
it, but in the second case there is no check because the assumption is
that nesting cannot happen when creating objects based on hints. The
violation of this assumption leads to various warnings and eventually to
a general protection fault [1].

Before fixing the root cause, error out when nesting happens and warn.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
