Subject: CVE-2024-26823: irqchip/gic-v3-its: Restore quirk probing for ACPI-based systems

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

irqchip/gic-v3-its: Restore quirk probing for ACPI-based systems

While refactoring the way the ITSs are probed, the handling of quirks
applicable to ACPI-based platforms was lost. As a result, systems such as
HIP07 lose their GICv4 functionnality, and some other may even fail to
boot, unless they are configured to boot with DT.

Move the enabling of quirks into its_probe_one(), making it common to all
firmware implementations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26823 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
