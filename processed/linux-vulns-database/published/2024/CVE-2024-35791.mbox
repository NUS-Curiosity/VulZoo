Subject: CVE-2024-35791: KVM: SVM: Flush pages under kvm->lock to fix UAF in svm_register_enc_region()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: SVM: Flush pages under kvm->lock to fix UAF in svm_register_enc_region()

Do the cache flush of converted pages in svm_register_enc_region() before
dropping kvm->lock to fix use-after-free issues where region and/or its
array of pages could be freed by a different task, e.g. if userspace has
__unregister_enc_region_locked() already queued up for the region.

Note, the "obvious" alternative of using local variables doesn't fully
resolve the bug, as region->pages is also dynamically allocated.  I.e. the
region structure itself would be fine, but region->pages could be freed.

Flushing multiple pages under kvm->lock is unfortunate, but the entire
flow is a rare slow path, and the manual flush is only needed on CPUs that
lack coherency for encrypted memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35791 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
