Subject: CVE-2024-47704: drm/amd/display: Check link_res->hpo_dp_link_enc before using it

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check link_res->hpo_dp_link_enc before using it

[WHAT & HOW]
Functions dp_enable_link_phy and dp_disable_link_phy can pass link_res
without initializing hpo_dp_link_enc and it is necessary to check for
null before dereferencing.

This fixes 2 FORWARD_NULL issues reported by Coverity.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47704 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
