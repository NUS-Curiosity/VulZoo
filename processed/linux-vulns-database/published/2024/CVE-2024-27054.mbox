Subject: CVE-2024-27054: s390/dasd: fix double module refcount decrement

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/dasd: fix double module refcount decrement

Once the discipline is associated with the device, deleting the device
takes care of decrementing the module's refcount.  Doing it manually on
this error path causes refcount to artificially decrease on each error
while it should just stay the same.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27054 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
