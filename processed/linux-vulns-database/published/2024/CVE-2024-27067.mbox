Subject: CVE-2024-27067: xen/evtchn: avoid WARN() when unbinding an event channel

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen/evtchn: avoid WARN() when unbinding an event channel

When unbinding a user event channel, the related handler might be
called a last time in case the kernel was built with
CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ. This might cause a WARN() in the handler.

Avoid that by adding an "unbinding" flag to struct user_event which
will short circuit the handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27067 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
