Subject: CVE-2024-54458: scsi: ufs: bsg: Set bsg_queue to NULL after removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: bsg: Set bsg_queue to NULL after removal

Currently, this does not cause any issues, but I believe it is necessary to
set bsg_queue to NULL after removing it to prevent potential use-after-free
(UAF) access.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-54458 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
