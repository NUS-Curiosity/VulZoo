Subject: CVE-2024-35879: of: dynamic: Synchronize of_changeset_destroy() with the devlink removals

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

of: dynamic: Synchronize of_changeset_destroy() with the devlink removals

In the following sequence:
  1) of_platform_depopulate()
  2) of_overlay_remove()

During the step 1, devices are destroyed and devlinks are removed.
During the step 2, OF nodes are destroyed but
__of_changeset_entry_destroy() can raise warnings related to missing
of_node_put():
  ERROR: memory leak, expected refcount 1 instead of 2 ...

Indeed, during the devlink removals performed at step 1, the removal
itself releasing the device (and the attached of_node) is done by a job
queued in a workqueue and so, it is done asynchronously with respect to
function calls.
When the warning is present, of_node_put() will be called but wrongly
too late from the workqueue job.

In order to be sure that any ongoing devlink removals are done before
the of_node destruction, synchronize the of_changeset_destroy() with the
devlink removals.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35879 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
