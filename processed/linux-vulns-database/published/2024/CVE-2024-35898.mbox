Subject: CVE-2024-35898: netfilter: nf_tables: Fix potential data-race in __nft_flowtable_type_get()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: Fix potential data-race in __nft_flowtable_type_get()

nft_unregister_flowtable_type() within nf_flow_inet_module_exit() can
concurrent with __nft_flowtable_type_get() within nf_tables_newflowtable().
And thhere is not any protection when iterate over nf_tables_flowtables
list in __nft_flowtable_type_get(). Therefore, there is pertential
data-race of nf_tables_flowtables list entry.

Use list_for_each_entry_rcu() to iterate over nf_tables_flowtables list
in __nft_flowtable_type_get(), and use rcu_read_lock() in the caller
nft_flowtable_type_get() to protect the entire type query process.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35898 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
