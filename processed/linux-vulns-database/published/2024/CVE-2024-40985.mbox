Subject: CVE-2024-40985: net/tcp_ao: Don't leak ao_info on error-path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/tcp_ao: Don't leak ao_info on error-path

It seems I introduced it together with TCP_AO_CMDF_AO_REQUIRED, on
version 5 [1] of TCP-AO patches. Quite frustrative that having all these
selftests that I've written, running kmemtest & kcov was always in todo.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
