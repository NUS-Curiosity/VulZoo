Subject: CVE-2024-27003: clk: Get runtime PM before walking tree for clk_summary

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: Get runtime PM before walking tree for clk_summary

Similar to the previous commit, we should make sure that all devices are
runtime resumed before printing the clk_summary through debugfs. Failure
to do so would result in a deadlock if the thread is resuming a device
to print clk state and that device is also runtime resuming in another
thread, e.g the screen is turning on and the display driver is starting
up. We remove the calls to clk_pm_runtime_{get,put}() in this path
because they're superfluous now that we know the devices are runtime
resumed. This also squashes a bug where the return value of
clk_pm_runtime_get() wasn't checked, leading to an RPM count underflow
on error paths.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27003 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
