Subject: CVE-2024-56641: net/smc: initialize close_work early to avoid warning

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: initialize close_work early to avoid warning

We encountered a warning that close_work was canceled before
initialization.

  WARNING: CPU: 7 PID: 111103 at kernel/workqueue.c:3047 __flush_work+0x19e/0x1b0
  Workqueue: events smc_lgr_terminate_work [smc]
  RIP: 0010:__flush_work+0x19e/0x1b0
  Call Trace:

   kthread+0x117/0x130
   ? __kthread_cancel_work+0x50/0x50
   ret_from_fork+0x22/0x30

This is because when smc_close_cancel_work is triggered, e.g. the RDMA
driver is rmmod and the LGR is terminated, the conn->close_work is
flushed before initialization, resulting in WARN_ON(!work->func).

__smc_lgr_terminate             | smc_connect_{rdma|ism}
-------------------------------------------------------------
                                | smc_conn_create
				| \- smc_lgr_register_conn
for conn in lgr->conns_all      |
\- smc_conn_kill                |
   \- smc_close_active_abort    |
      \- smc_close_cancel_work  |
         \- cancel_work_sync    |
            \- __flush_work     |
	         (close_work)   |
	                        | smc_close_init
	                        | \- INIT_WORK(&close_work)

So fix this by initializing close_work before establishing the
connection.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56641 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
