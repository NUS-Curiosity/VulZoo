Subject: CVE-2024-35823: vt: fix unicode buffer corruption when deleting characters

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vt: fix unicode buffer corruption when deleting characters

This is the same issue that was fixed for the VGA text buffer in commit
39cdb68c64d8 ("vt: fix memory overlapping when deleting chars in the
buffer"). The cure is also the same i.e. replace memcpy() with memmove()
due to the overlaping buffers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35823 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
