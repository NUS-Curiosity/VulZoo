Subject: CVE-2024-27396: net: gtp: Fix Use-After-Free in gtp_dellink

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: gtp: Fix Use-After-Free in gtp_dellink

Since call_rcu, which is called in the hlist_for_each_entry_rcu traversal
of gtp_dellink, is not part of the RCU read critical section, it
is possible that the RCU grace period will pass during the traversal and
the key will be free.

To prevent this, it should be changed to hlist_for_each_entry_safe.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27396 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
