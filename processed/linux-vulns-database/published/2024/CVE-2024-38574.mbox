Subject: CVE-2024-38574: libbpf: Prevent null-pointer dereference when prog to load has no BTF

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libbpf: Prevent null-pointer dereference when prog to load has no BTF

In bpf_objec_load_prog(), there's no guarantee that obj->btf is non-NULL
when passing it to btf__fd(), and this function does not perform any
check before dereferencing its argument (as bpf_object__btf_fd() used to
do). As a consequence, we get segmentation fault errors in bpftool (for
example) when trying to load programs that come without BTF information.

v2: Keep btf__fd() in the fix instead of reverting to bpf_object__btf_fd().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38574 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
