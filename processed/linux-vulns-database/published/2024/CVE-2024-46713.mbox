Subject: CVE-2024-46713: perf/aux: Fix AUX buffer serialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf/aux: Fix AUX buffer serialization

Ole reported that event->mmap_mutex is strictly insufficient to
serialize the AUX buffer, add a per RB mutex to fully serialize it.

Note that in the lock order comment the perf_event::mmap_mutex order
was already wrong, that is, it nesting under mmap_lock is not new with
this patch.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46713 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
