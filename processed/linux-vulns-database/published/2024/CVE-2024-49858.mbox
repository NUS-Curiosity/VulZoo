Subject: CVE-2024-49858: efistub/tpm: Use ACPI reclaim memory for event log to avoid corruption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efistub/tpm: Use ACPI reclaim memory for event log to avoid corruption

The TPM event log table is a Linux specific construct, where the data
produced by the GetEventLog() boot service is cached in memory, and
passed on to the OS using an EFI configuration table.

The use of EFI_LOADER_DATA here results in the region being left
unreserved in the E820 memory map constructed by the EFI stub, and this
is the memory description that is passed on to the incoming kernel by
kexec, which is therefore unaware that the region should be reserved.

Even though the utility of the TPM2 event log after a kexec is
questionable, any corruption might send the parsing code off into the
weeds and crash the kernel. So let's use EFI_ACPI_RECLAIM_MEMORY
instead, which is always treated as reserved by the E820 conversion
logic.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49858 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
