Subject: CVE-2024-44970: net/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix invalid WQ linked list unlink

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix invalid WQ linked list unlink

When all the strides in a WQE have been consumed, the WQE is unlinked
from the WQ linked list (mlx5_wq_ll_pop()). For SHAMPO, it is possible
to receive CQEs with 0 consumed strides for the same WQE even after the
WQE is fully consumed and unlinked. This triggers an additional unlink
for the same wqe which corrupts the linked list.

Fix this scenario by accepting 0 sized consumed strides without
unlinking the WQE again.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44970 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
