Subject: CVE-2024-56546: drivers: soc: xilinx: add the missing kfree in xlnx_add_cb_for_suspend()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers: soc: xilinx: add the missing kfree in xlnx_add_cb_for_suspend()

If we fail to allocate memory for cb_data by kmalloc, the memory
allocation for eve_data is never freed, add the missing kfree()
in the error handling path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56546 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
