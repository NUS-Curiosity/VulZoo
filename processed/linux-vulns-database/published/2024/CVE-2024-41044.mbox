Subject: CVE-2024-41044: ppp: reject claimed-as-LCP but actually malformed packets

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ppp: reject claimed-as-LCP but actually malformed packets

Since 'ppp_async_encode()' assumes valid LCP packets (with code
from 1 to 7 inclusive), add 'ppp_check_packet()' to ensure that
LCP packet has an actual body beyond PPP_LCP header bytes, and
reject claimed-as-LCP but actually malformed data otherwise.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41044 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
