Subject: CVE-2024-50264: vsock/virtio: Initialization of the dangling pointer occurring in vsk->trans

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: Initialization of the dangling pointer occurring in vsk->trans

During loopback communication, a dangling pointer can be created in
vsk->trans, potentially leading to a Use-After-Free condition.  This
issue is resolved by initializing vsk->trans to NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50264 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
