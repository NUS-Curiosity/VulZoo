Subject: CVE-2024-50211: udf: refactor inode_bmap() to handle error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udf: refactor inode_bmap() to handle error

Refactor inode_bmap() to handle error since udf_next_aext() can return
error now. On situations like ftruncate, udf_extend_file() can now
detect errors and bail out early without resorting to checking for
particular offsets and assuming internal behavior of these functions.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50211 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.6.59 with commit 493447dd8336607fce426f7879e581095f6c606e
	Fixed in 6.11.6 with commit b22d9a5698abf04341f8fbc30141e0673863c3a6
	Fixed in 6.12 with commit c226964ec786f3797ed389a16392ce4357697d24

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-50211
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
