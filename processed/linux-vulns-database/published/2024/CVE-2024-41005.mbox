Subject: CVE-2024-41005: netpoll: Fix race condition in netpoll_owner_active

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netpoll: Fix race condition in netpoll_owner_active

KCSAN detected a race condition in netpoll:

	BUG: KCSAN: data-race in net_rx_action / netpoll_send_skb
	write (marked) to 0xffff8881164168b0 of 4 bytes by interrupt on cpu 10:
	net_rx_action (./include/linux/netpoll.h:90 net/core/dev.c:6712 net/core/dev.c:6822)
<snip>
	read to 0xffff8881164168b0 of 4 bytes by task 1 on cpu 2:
	netpoll_send_skb (net/core/netpoll.c:319 net/core/netpoll.c:345 net/core/netpoll.c:393)
	netpoll_send_udp (net/core/netpoll.c:?)
<snip>
	value changed: 0x0000000a -> 0xffffffff

This happens because netpoll_owner_active() needs to check if the
current CPU is the owner of the lock, touching napi->poll_owner
non atomically. The ->poll_owner field contains the current CPU holding
the lock.

Use an atomic read to check if the poll owner is the current CPU.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41005 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
