Subject: CVE-2024-53203: usb: typec: fix potential array underflow in ucsi_ccg_sync_control()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: fix potential array underflow in ucsi_ccg_sync_control()

The "command" variable can be controlled by the user via debugfs.  The
worry is that if con_index is zero then "&uc->ucsi->connector[con_index
- 1]" would be an array underflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53203 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
