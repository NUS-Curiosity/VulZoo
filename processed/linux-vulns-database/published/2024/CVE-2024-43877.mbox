Subject: CVE-2024-43877: media: pci: ivtv: Add check for DMA map result

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: pci: ivtv: Add check for DMA map result

In case DMA fails, 'dma->SG_length' is 0. This value is later used to
access 'dma->SGarray[dma->SG_length - 1]', which will cause out of
bounds access.

Add check to return early on invalid value. Adjust warnings accordingly.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43877 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
