Subject: CVE-2024-50057: usb: typec: tipd: Free IRQ only if it was requested before

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: tipd: Free IRQ only if it was requested before

In polling mode, if no IRQ was requested there is no need to free it.
Call devm_free_irq() only if client->irq is set. This fixes the warning
caused by the tps6598x module removal:

WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 333 at kernel/irq/devres.c:144 devm_free_irq+0x80/0x8c

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b72bf5cade51ba4055c8a8998d275e72e6b521ce
