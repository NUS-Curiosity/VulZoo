Subject: CVE-2024-43816: scsi: lpfc: Revise lpfc_prep_embed_io routine with proper endian macro usages

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Revise lpfc_prep_embed_io routine with proper endian macro usages

On big endian architectures, it is possible to run into a memory out of
bounds pointer dereference when FCP targets are zoned.

In lpfc_prep_embed_io, the memcpy(ptr, fcp_cmnd, sgl->sge_len) is
referencing a little endian formatted sgl->sge_len value.  So, the memcpy
can cause big endian systems to crash.

Redefine the *sgl ptr as a struct sli4_sge_le to make it clear that we are
referring to a little endian formatted data structure.  And, update the
routine with proper le32_to_cpu macro usages.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43816 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
