Subject: CVE-2024-42279: spi: microchip-core: ensure TX and RX FIFOs are empty at start of a transfer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: microchip-core: ensure TX and RX FIFOs are empty at start of a transfer

While transmitting with rx_len == 0, the RX FIFO is not going to be
emptied in the interrupt handler. A subsequent transfer could then
read crap from the previous transfer out of the RX FIFO into the
start RX buffer. The core provides a register that will empty the RX and
TX FIFOs, so do that before each transfer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42279 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3feda3677e8bbe833c3a62a4091377a08f015b80
