Subject: CVE-2024-35991: dmaengine: idxd: Convert spinlock to mutex to lock evl workqueue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Convert spinlock to mutex to lock evl workqueue

drain_workqueue() cannot be called safely in a spinlocked context due to
possible task rescheduling. In the multi-task scenario, calling
queue_work() while drain_workqueue() will lead to a Call Trace as
pushing a work on a draining workqueue is not permitted in spinlocked
context.
    Call Trace:

The current implementation uses a spinlock to protect event log workqueue
and will lead to the Call Trace due to potential task rescheduling.

To address the locking issue, convert the spinlock to mutex, allowing
the drain_workqueue() to be called in a safe mutex-locked context.

This change ensures proper synchronization when accessing the event log
workqueue, preventing potential Call Trace and improving the overall
robustness of the code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35991 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
