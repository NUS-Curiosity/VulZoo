Subject: CVE-2024-50189: HID: amd_sfh: Switch to device-managed dmam_alloc_coherent()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: amd_sfh: Switch to device-managed dmam_alloc_coherent()

Using the device-managed version allows to simplify clean-up in probe()
error path.

Additionally, this device-managed ensures proper cleanup, which helps to
resolve memory errors, page faults, btrfs going read-only, and btrfs
disk corruption.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50189 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
