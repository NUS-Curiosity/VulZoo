Subject: CVE-2024-49881: ext4: update orig_path in ext4_find_extent()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: update orig_path in ext4_find_extent()

In ext4_find_extent(), if the path is not big enough, we free it and set
*orig_path to NULL. But after reallocating and successfully initializing
the path, we don't update *orig_path, in which case the caller gets a
valid path but a NULL ppath, and this may cause a NULL pointer dereference
or a path memory leak. For example:

ext4_split_extent
  path = *ppath = 2000
  ext4_find_extent
    if (depth > path[0].p_maxdepth)
      kfree(path = 2000);
      *orig_path = path = NULL;
      path = kcalloc() = 3000
  ext4_split_extent_at(*ppath = NULL)
    path = *ppath;
    ex = path[depth].p_ext;
    // NULL pointer dereference!

==================================================================
BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000010
CPU: 6 UID: 0 PID: 576 Comm: fsstress Not tainted 6.11.0-rc2-dirty #847

==================================================================

Therefore, *orig_path is updated when the extent lookup succeeds, so that
the caller can safely use path or *ppath.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49881 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
