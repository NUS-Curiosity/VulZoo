Subject: CVE-2024-57877: arm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_POE

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_POE

Currently poe_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'ctrl' variable,
and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this
uninitialized. Consequently an arbitrary value will be written back to
target->thread.por_el0, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from
the kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack,
and the issue does not provide a write mechanism.

Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset
from userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,
NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing
contents of POR_EL1 will be retained.

Before this patch:

| # ./poe-test
| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d
| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) wrote 8 bytes
|
| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0
| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes
| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d
|
| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE (zero length)
| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=0) wrote 0 bytes
|
| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0
| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes
| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0xffff8000839c3d50

After this patch:

| # ./poe-test
| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d
| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) wrote 8 bytes
|
| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0
| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes
| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d
|
| Attempting to write NT_ARM_POE (zero length)
| SETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=0) wrote 0 bytes
|
| Attempting to read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0
| GETREGSET(nt=0x40f, len=8) read 8 bytes
| Read NT_ARM_POE::por_el0 = 0x900d900d900d900d

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4105dd76bc8ad6529d47157ef0565cb84ca6676c
