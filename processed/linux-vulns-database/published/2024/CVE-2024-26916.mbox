Subject: CVE-2024-26916: Revert "drm/amd: flush any delayed gfxoff on suspend entry"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "drm/amd: flush any delayed gfxoff on suspend entry"

commit ab4750332dbe ("drm/amdgpu/sdma5.2: add begin/end_use ring
callbacks") caused GFXOFF control to be used more heavily and the
codepath that was removed from commit 0dee72639533 ("drm/amd: flush any
delayed gfxoff on suspend entry") now can be exercised at suspend again.

Users report that by using GNOME to suspend the lockscreen trigger will
cause SDMA traffic and the system can deadlock.

This reverts commit 0dee726395333fea833eaaf838bc80962df886c8.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26916 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
