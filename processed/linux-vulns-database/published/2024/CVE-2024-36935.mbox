Subject: CVE-2024-36935: ice: ensure the copied buf is NUL terminated

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: ensure the copied buf is NUL terminated

Currently, we allocate a count-sized kernel buffer and copy count bytes
from userspace to that buffer. Later, we use sscanf on this buffer but we
don't ensure that the string is terminated inside the buffer, this can lead
to OOB read when using sscanf. Fix this issue by using memdup_user_nul
instead of memdup_user.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36935 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5ff4de981983ed84f29b5d92b6550ec054e12a92
