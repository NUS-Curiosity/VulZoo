Subject: CVE-2024-26777: fbdev: sis: Error out if pixclock equals zero

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: sis: Error out if pixclock equals zero

The userspace program could pass any values to the driver through
ioctl() interface. If the driver doesn't check the value of pixclock,
it may cause divide-by-zero error.

In sisfb_check_var(), var->pixclock is used as a divisor to caculate
drate before it is checked against zero. Fix this by checking it
at the beginning.

This is similar to CVE-2022-3061 in i740fb which was fixed by
commit 15cf0b8.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26777 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
