Subject: CVE-2024-38635: soundwire: cadence: fix invalid PDI offset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soundwire: cadence: fix invalid PDI offset

For some reason, we add an offset to the PDI, presumably to skip the
PDI0 and PDI1 which are reserved for BPT.

This code is however completely wrong and leads to an out-of-bounds
access. We were just lucky so far since we used only a couple of PDIs
and remained within the PDI array bounds.

A Fixes: tag is not provided since there are no known platforms where
the out-of-bounds would be accessed, and the initial code had problems
as well.

A follow-up patch completely removes this useless offset.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38635 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
