Subject: CVE-2024-26694: wifi: iwlwifi: fix double-free bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: fix double-free bug

The storage for the TLV PC register data wasn't done like all
the other storage in the drv->fw area, which is cleared at the
end of deallocation. Therefore, the freeing must also be done
differently, explicitly NULL'ing it out after the free, since
otherwise there's a nasty double-free bug here if a file fails
to load after this has been parsed, and we get another free
later (e.g. because no other file exists.) Fix that by adding
the missing NULL assignment.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26694 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ab9d4bb9a1892439b3123fc52b19e32b9cdf80ad
