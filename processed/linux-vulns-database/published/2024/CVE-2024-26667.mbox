Subject: CVE-2024-26667: drm/msm/dpu: check for valid hw_pp in dpu_encoder_helper_phys_cleanup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm/dpu: check for valid hw_pp in dpu_encoder_helper_phys_cleanup

The commit 8b45a26f2ba9 ("drm/msm/dpu: reserve cdm blocks for writeback
in case of YUV output") introduced a smatch warning about another
conditional block in dpu_encoder_helper_phys_cleanup() which had assumed
hw_pp will always be valid which may not necessarily be true.

Lets fix the other conditional block by making sure hw_pp is valid
before dereferencing it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26667 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
