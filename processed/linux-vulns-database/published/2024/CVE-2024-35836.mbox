Subject: CVE-2024-35836: dpll: fix pin dump crash for rebound module

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dpll: fix pin dump crash for rebound module

When a kernel module is unbound but the pin resources were not entirely
freed (other kernel module instance of the same PCI device have had kept
the reference to that pin), and kernel module is again bound, the pin
properties would not be updated (the properties are only assigned when
memory for the pin is allocated), prop pointer still points to the
kernel module memory of the kernel module which was deallocated on the
unbind.

If the pin dump is invoked in this state, the result is a kernel crash.
Prevent the crash by storing persistent pin properties in dpll subsystem,
copy the content from the kernel module when pin is allocated, instead of
using memory of the kernel module.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35836 to this issue.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/dpll/dpll_core.c
	drivers/dpll/dpll_core.h
	drivers/dpll/dpll_netlink.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5050a5b9d8b4d3c6f7e376e07670e437db7ccf9c
