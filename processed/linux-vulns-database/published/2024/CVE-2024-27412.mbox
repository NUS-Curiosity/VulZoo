Subject: CVE-2024-27412: power: supply: bq27xxx-i2c: Do not free non existing IRQ

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

power: supply: bq27xxx-i2c: Do not free non existing IRQ

The bq27xxx i2c-client may not have an IRQ, in which case
client->irq will be 0. bq27xxx_battery_i2c_probe() already has
an if (client->irq) check wrapping the request_threaded_irq().

But bq27xxx_battery_i2c_remove() unconditionally calls
free_irq(client->irq) leading to:

[  190.310742] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[  190.310843] Trying to free already-free IRQ 0
[  190.310861] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 1304 at kernel/irq/manage.c:1893 free_irq+0x1b8/0x310

Followed by a backtrace when unbinding the driver. Add
an if (client->irq) to bq27xxx_battery_i2c_remove() mirroring
probe() to fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27412 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
