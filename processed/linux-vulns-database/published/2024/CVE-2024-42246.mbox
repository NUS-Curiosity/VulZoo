Subject: CVE-2024-42246: net, sunrpc: Remap EPERM in case of connection failure in xs_tcp_setup_socket

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net, sunrpc: Remap EPERM in case of connection failure in xs_tcp_setup_socket

When using a BPF program on kernel_connect(), the call can return -EPERM. This
causes xs_tcp_setup_socket() to loop forever, filling up the syslog and causing
the kernel to potentially freeze up.

Neil suggested:

  This will propagate -EPERM up into other layers which might not be ready
  to handle it. It might be safer to map EPERM to an error we would be more
  likely to expect from the network system - such as ECONNREFUSED or ENETDOWN.

ECONNREFUSED as error seems reasonable. For programs setting a different error
can be out of reach (see handling in 4fbac77d2d09) in particular on kernels
which do not have f10d05966196 ("bpf: Make BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY return -err
instead of allow boolean"), thus given that it is better to simply remap for
consistent behavior. UDP does handle EPERM in xs_udp_send_request().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42246 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
