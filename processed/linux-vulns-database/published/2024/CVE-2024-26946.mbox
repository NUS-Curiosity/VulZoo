Subject: CVE-2024-26946: kprobes/x86: Use copy_from_kernel_nofault() to read from unsafe address

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kprobes/x86: Use copy_from_kernel_nofault() to read from unsafe address

Read from an unsafe address with copy_from_kernel_nofault() in
arch_adjust_kprobe_addr() because this function is used before checking
the address is in text or not. Syzcaller bot found a bug and reported
the case if user specifies inaccessible data area,
arch_adjust_kprobe_addr() will cause a kernel panic.

[ mingo: Clarified the comment. ]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
