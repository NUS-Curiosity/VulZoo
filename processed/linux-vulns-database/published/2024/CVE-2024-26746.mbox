Subject: CVE-2024-26746: dmaengine: idxd: Ensure safe user copy of completion record

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Ensure safe user copy of completion record

If CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY is enabled, copying completion record from
event log cache to user triggers a kernel bug.

The issue arises because event log cache is created using
kmem_cache_create() which is not suitable for user copy.

Fix the issue by creating event log cache with
kmem_cache_create_usercopy(), ensuring safe user copy.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26746 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
