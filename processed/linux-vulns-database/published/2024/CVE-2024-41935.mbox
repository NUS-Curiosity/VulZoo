Subject: CVE-2024-41935: f2fs: fix to shrink read extent node in batches

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to shrink read extent node in batches

We use rwlock to protect core structure data of extent tree during
its shrink, however, if there is a huge number of extent nodes in
extent tree, during shrink of extent tree, it may hold rwlock for
a very long time, which may trigger kernel hang issue.

This patch fixes to shrink read extent node in batches, so that,
critical region of the rwlock can be shrunk to avoid its extreme
long time hold.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41935 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
