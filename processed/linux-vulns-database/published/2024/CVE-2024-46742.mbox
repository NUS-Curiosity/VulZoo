Subject: CVE-2024-46742: smb/server: fix potential null-ptr-deref of lease_ctx_info in smb2_open()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb/server: fix potential null-ptr-deref of lease_ctx_info in smb2_open()

null-ptr-deref will occur when (req_op_level == SMB2_OPLOCK_LEVEL_LEASE)
and parse_lease_state() return NULL.

Fix this by check if 'lease_ctx_info' is NULL.

Additionally, remove the redundant parentheses in
parse_durable_handle_context().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46742 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
