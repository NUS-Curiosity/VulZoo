Subject: CVE-2024-26662: drm/amd/display: Fix 'panel_cntl' could be null in 'dcn21_set_backlight_level()'

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix 'panel_cntl' could be null in 'dcn21_set_backlight_level()'

'panel_cntl' structure used to control the display panel could be null,
dereferencing it could lead to a null pointer access.

Fixes the below:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn21/dcn21_hwseq.c:269 dcn21_set_backlight_level() error: we previously assumed 'panel_cntl' could be null (see line 250)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26662 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
