Subject: CVE-2024-46779: drm/imagination: Free pvr_vm_gpuva after unlink

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/imagination: Free pvr_vm_gpuva after unlink

This caused a measurable memory leak. Although the individual
allocations are small, the leaks occurs in a high-usage codepath
(remapping or unmapping device memory) so they add up quickly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46779 to this issue.

	drivers/gpu/drm/imagination/pvr_vm.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1cc695be8920df234f83270d789078cb2d3bc564
