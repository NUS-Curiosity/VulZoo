Subject: CVE-2024-37026: drm/xe: Only use reserved BCS instances for usm migrate exec queue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Only use reserved BCS instances for usm migrate exec queue

The GuC context scheduling queue is 2 entires deep, thus it is possible
for a migration job to be stuck behind a fault if migration exec queue
shares engines with user jobs. This can deadlock as the migrate exec
queue is required to service page faults. Avoid deadlock by only using
reserved BCS instances for usm migrate exec queue.

(cherry picked from commit 04f4a70a183a688a60fe3882d6e4236ea02cfc67)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-37026 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
