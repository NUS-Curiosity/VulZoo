Subject: CVE-2024-53092: virtio_pci: Fix admin vq cleanup by using correct info pointer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_pci: Fix admin vq cleanup by using correct info pointer

vp_modern_avq_cleanup() and vp_del_vqs() clean up admin vq
resources by virtio_pci_vq_info pointer. The info pointer of admin
vq is stored in vp_dev->admin_vq.info instead of vp_dev->vqs[].
Using the info pointer from vp_dev->vqs[] for admin vq causes a
kernel NULL pointer dereference bug.
In vp_modern_avq_cleanup() and vp_del_vqs(), get the info pointer
from vp_dev->admin_vq.info for admin vq to clean up the resources.
Also make info ptr as argument of vp_del_vq() to be symmetric with
vp_setup_vq().

vp_reset calls vp_modern_avq_cleanup, and causes the Call Trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/018d3d4ad4be7fbc95d8a2367642a32d21df55c7
