Subject: CVE-2024-50270: mm/damon/core: avoid overflow in damon_feed_loop_next_input()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/damon/core: avoid overflow in damon_feed_loop_next_input()

damon_feed_loop_next_input() is inefficient and fragile to overflows. 
Specifically, 'score_goal_diff_bp' calculation can overflow when 'score'
is high.  The calculation is actually unnecessary at all because 'goal' is
a constant of value 10,000.  Calculation of 'compensation' is again
fragile to overflow.  Final calculation of return value for under-achiving
case is again fragile to overflow when the current score is
under-achieving the target.

Add two corner cases handling at the beginning of the function to make the
body easier to read, and rewrite the body of the function to avoid
overflows and the unnecessary bp value calcuation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50270 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2d339a1f0f16ff5dea58e612ff336f0be0d041e9
