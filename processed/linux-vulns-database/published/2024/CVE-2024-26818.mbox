Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tools/rtla: Fix clang warning about mount_point var size

clang is reporting this warning:

src/utils.c:548:66: warning: 'fscanf' may overflow; destination buffer in argument 3 has size 1024, but the corresponding specifier may require size 1025 [-Wfortify-source]
  548 |         while (fscanf(fp, "%*s %" STR(MAX_PATH) "s %99s %*s %*d %*d\n", mount_point, type) == 2) {

Increase mount_point variable size to MAX_PATH+1 to avoid the overflow.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
