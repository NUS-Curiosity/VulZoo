Subject: CVE-2024-41089: drm/nouveau/dispnv04: fix null pointer dereference in nv17_tv_get_hd_modes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau/dispnv04: fix null pointer dereference in nv17_tv_get_hd_modes

In nv17_tv_get_hd_modes(), the return value of drm_mode_duplicate() is
assigned to mode, which will lead to a possible NULL pointer dereference
on failure of drm_mode_duplicate(). The same applies to drm_cvt_mode().
Add a check to avoid null pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41089 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
