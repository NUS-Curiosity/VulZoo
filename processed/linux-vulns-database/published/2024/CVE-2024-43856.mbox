Subject: CVE-2024-43856: dma: fix call order in dmam_free_coherent

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dma: fix call order in dmam_free_coherent

dmam_free_coherent() frees a DMA allocation, which makes the
freed vaddr available for reuse, then calls devres_destroy()
to remove and free the data structure used to track the DMA
allocation. Between the two calls, it is possible for a
concurrent task to make an allocation with the same vaddr
and add it to the devres list.

If this happens, there will be two entries in the devres list
with the same vaddr and devres_destroy() can free the wrong
entry, triggering the WARN_ON() in dmam_match.

Fix by destroying the devres entry before freeing the DMA
allocation.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
