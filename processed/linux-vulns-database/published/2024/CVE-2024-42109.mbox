Subject: CVE-2024-42109: netfilter: nf_tables: unconditionally flush pending work before notifier

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: unconditionally flush pending work before notifier

syzbot reports:

KASAN: slab-uaf in nft_ctx_update include/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h:1831
KASAN: slab-uaf in nft_commit_release net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:9530
KASAN: slab-uaf int nf_tables_trans_destroy_work+0x152b/0x1750 net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:9597

Workqueue: events nf_tables_trans_destroy_work
Call Trace:
 nft_ctx_update include/net/netfilter/nf_tables.h:1831 [inline]

 nf_tables_trans_destroy_work+0x152b/0x1750 net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c:9597

Problem is that the notifier does a conditional flush, but its possible
that the table-to-be-removed is still referenced by transactions being
processed by the worker, so we need to flush unconditionally.

We could make the flush_work depend on whether we found a table to delete
in nf-next to avoid the flush for most cases.

AFAICS this problem is only exposed in nf-next, with
commit e169285f8c56 ("netfilter: nf_tables: do not store nft_ctx in transaction objects"),
with this commit applied there is an unconditional fetch of
table->family which is whats triggering the above splat.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42109 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
