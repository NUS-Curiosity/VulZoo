Subject: CVE-2024-58008: KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix improper sg use with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix improper sg use with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y

With vmalloc stack addresses enabled (CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y) DCP trusted
keys can crash during en- and decryption of the blob encryption key via
the DCP crypto driver. This is caused by improperly using sg_init_one()
with vmalloc'd stack buffers (plain_key_blob).

Fix this by always using kmalloc() for buffers we give to the DCP crypto
driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58008 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
