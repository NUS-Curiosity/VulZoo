Subject: CVE-2024-27032: f2fs: fix to avoid potential panic during recovery

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to avoid potential panic during recovery

During recovery, if FAULT_BLOCK is on, it is possible that
f2fs_reserve_new_block() will return -ENOSPC during recovery,
then it may trigger panic.

Also, if fault injection rate is 1 and only FAULT_BLOCK fault
type is on, it may encounter deadloop in loop of block reservation.

Let's change as below to fix these issues:
- remove bug_on() to avoid panic.
- limit the loop count of block reservation to avoid potential
deadloop.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27032 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
