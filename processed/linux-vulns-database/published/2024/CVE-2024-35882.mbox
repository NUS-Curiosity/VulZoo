Subject: CVE-2024-35882: SUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

SUNRPC: Fix a slow server-side memory leak with RPC-over-TCP

Jan Schunk reports that his small NFS servers suffer from memory
exhaustion after just a few days. A bisect shows that commit
e18e157bb5c8 ("SUNRPC: Send RPC message on TCP with a single
sock_sendmsg() call") is the first bad commit.

That commit assumed that sock_sendmsg() releases all the pages in
the underlying bio_vec array, but the reality is that it doesn't.
svc_xprt_release() releases the rqst's response pages, but the
record marker page fragment isn't one of those, so it is never
released.

This is a narrow fix that can be applied to stable kernels. A
more extensive fix is in the works.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35882 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1ba1291172f935e6b6fe703161a948f3347400b8
