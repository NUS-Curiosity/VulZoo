Subject: CVE-2024-56730: net/9p/usbg: fix handling of the failed kzalloc() memory allocation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/9p/usbg: fix handling of the failed kzalloc() memory allocation

On the linux-next, next-20241108 vanilla kernel, the coccinelle tool gave the
following error report:

./net/9p/trans_usbg.c:912:5-11: ERROR: allocation function on line 911 returns
NULL not ERR_PTR on failure

kzalloc() failure is fixed to handle the NULL return case on the memory exhaustion.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56730 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2cdb416de8b5795fd25fadcb69e1198b6df6d8cc
