Subject: CVE-2024-50016: drm/amd/display: Avoid overflow assignment in link_dp_cts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Avoid overflow assignment in link_dp_cts

sampling_rate is an uint8_t but is assigned an unsigned int, and thus it
can overflow. As a result, sampling_rate is changed to uint32_t.

Similarly, LINK_QUAL_PATTERN_SET has a size of 2 bits, and it should
only be assigned to a value less or equal than 4.

This fixes 2 INTEGER_OVERFLOW issues reported by Coverity.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50016 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
