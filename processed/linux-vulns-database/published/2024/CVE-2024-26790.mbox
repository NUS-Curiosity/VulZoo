Subject: CVE-2024-26790: dmaengine: fsl-qdma: fix SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: fsl-qdma: fix SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read

There is chip (ls1028a) errata:

The SoC may hang on 16 byte unaligned read transactions by QDMA.

Unaligned read transactions initiated by QDMA may stall in the NOC
(Network On-Chip), causing a deadlock condition. Stalled transactions will
trigger completion timeouts in PCIe controller.

Workaround:
Enable prefetch by setting the source descriptor prefetchable bit
( SD[PF] = 1 ).

Implement this workaround.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26790 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
