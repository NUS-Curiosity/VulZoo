Subject: CVE-2024-26919: usb: ulpi: Fix debugfs directory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: ulpi: Fix debugfs directory leak

The ULPI per-device debugfs root is named after the ulpi device's
parent, but ulpi_unregister_interface tries to remove a debugfs
directory named after the ulpi device itself. This results in the
directory sticking around and preventing subsequent (deferred) probes
from succeeding. Change the directory name to match the ulpi device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26919 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
