Subject: CVE-2024-40931: mptcp: ensure snd_una is properly initialized on connect

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: ensure snd_una is properly initialized on connect

This is strictly related to commit fb7a0d334894 ("mptcp: ensure snd_nxt
is properly initialized on connect"). It turns out that syzkaller can
trigger the retransmit after fallback and before processing any other
incoming packet - so that snd_una is still left uninitialized.

Address the issue explicitly initializing snd_una together with snd_nxt
and write_seq.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40931 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
