Subject: CVE-2024-50252: mlxsw: spectrum_ipip: Fix memory leak when changing remote IPv6 address

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_ipip: Fix memory leak when changing remote IPv6 address

The device stores IPv6 addresses that are used for encapsulation in
linear memory that is managed by the driver.

Changing the remote address of an ip6gre net device never worked
properly, but since cited commit the following reproducer [1] would
result in a warning [2] and a memory leak [3]. The problem is that the
new remote address is never added by the driver to its hash table (and
therefore the device) and the old address is never removed from it.

Fix by programming the new address when the configuration of the ip6gre
net device changes and removing the old one. If the address did not
change, then the above would result in increasing the reference count of
the address and then decreasing it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
