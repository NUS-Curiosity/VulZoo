Subject: CVE-2024-27039: clk: hisilicon: hi3559a: Fix an erroneous devm_kfree()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: hisilicon: hi3559a: Fix an erroneous devm_kfree()

'p_clk' is an array allocated just before the for loop for all clk that
need to be registered.
It is incremented at each loop iteration.

If a clk_register() call fails, 'p_clk' may point to something different
from what should be freed.

The best we can do, is to avoid this wrong release of memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27039 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
