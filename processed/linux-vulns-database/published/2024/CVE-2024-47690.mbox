Online repaire on corrupted directory in f2fs_lookup() can generate
dirty data/meta while racing w/ readonly remount, it may leave dirty
inode after filesystem becomes readonly, however, checkpoint() will
skips flushing dirty inode in a state of readonly mode, result in
above panic.

Let's get rid of online repaire in f2fs_lookup(), and leave the work
to fsck.f2fs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47690 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
