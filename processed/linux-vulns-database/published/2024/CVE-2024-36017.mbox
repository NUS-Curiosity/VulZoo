Subject: CVE-2024-36017: rtnetlink: Correct nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST attribute validation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtnetlink: Correct nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST attribute validation

Each attribute inside a nested IFLA_VF_VLAN_LIST is assumed to be a
struct ifla_vf_vlan_info so the size of such attribute needs to be at least
of sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) which is 14 bytes.
The current size validation in do_setvfinfo is against NLA_HDRLEN (4 bytes)
which is less than sizeof(struct ifla_vf_vlan_info) so this validation
is not enough and a too small attribute might be cast to a
struct ifla_vf_vlan_info, this might result in an out of bands
read access when accessing the saved (casted) entry in ivvl.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36017 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
