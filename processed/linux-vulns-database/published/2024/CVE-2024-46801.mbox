Subject: CVE-2024-46801: libfs: fix get_stashed_dentry()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libfs: fix get_stashed_dentry()

get_stashed_dentry() tries to optimistically retrieve a stashed dentry
from a provided location.  It needs to ensure to hold rcu lock before it
dereference the stashed location to prevent UAF issues.  Use
rcu_dereference() instead of READ_ONCE() it's effectively equivalent
with some lockdep bells and whistles and it communicates clearly that
this expects rcu protection.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46801 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
