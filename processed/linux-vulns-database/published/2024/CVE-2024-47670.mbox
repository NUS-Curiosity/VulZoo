Subject: CVE-2024-47670: ocfs2: add bounds checking to ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: add bounds checking to ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()

Add a paranoia check to make sure it doesn't stray beyond valid memory
region containing ocfs2 xattr entries when scanning for a match.  It will
prevent out-of-bound access in case of crafted images.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47670 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
