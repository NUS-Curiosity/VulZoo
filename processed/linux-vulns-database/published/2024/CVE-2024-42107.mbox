Subject: CVE-2024-42107: ice: Don't process extts if PTP is disabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Don't process extts if PTP is disabled

The ice_ptp_extts_event() function can race with ice_ptp_release() and
result in a NULL pointer dereference which leads to a kernel panic.

Panic occurs because the ice_ptp_extts_event() function calls
ptp_clock_event() with a NULL pointer. The ice driver has already
released the PTP clock by the time the interrupt for the next external
timestamp event occurs.

To fix this, modify the ice_ptp_extts_event() function to check the
PTP state and bail early if PTP is not ready.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42107 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c4e524811918600683b1ea87a5e0fc2db64fa9b
