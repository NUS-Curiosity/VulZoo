Subject: CVE-2024-57947: netfilter: nf_set_pipapo: fix initial map fill

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_set_pipapo: fix initial map fill

The initial buffer has to be inited to all-ones, but it must restrict
it to the size of the first field, not the total field size.

After each round in the map search step, the result and the fill map
are swapped, so if we have a set where f->bsize of the first element
is smaller than m->bsize_max, those one-bits are leaked into future
rounds result map.

This makes pipapo find an incorrect matching results for sets where
first field size is not the largest.

Followup patch adds a test case to nft_concat_range.sh selftest script.

Thanks to Stefano Brivio for pointing out that we need to zero out
the remainder explicitly, only correcting memset() argument isn't enough.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57947 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
