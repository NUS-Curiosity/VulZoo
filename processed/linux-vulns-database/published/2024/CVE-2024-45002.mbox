Subject: CVE-2024-45002: rtla/osnoise: Prevent NULL dereference in error handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtla/osnoise: Prevent NULL dereference in error handling

If the "tool->data" allocation fails then there is no need to call
osnoise_free_top() and, in fact, doing so will lead to a NULL dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-45002 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
