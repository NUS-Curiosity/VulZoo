Subject: CVE-2024-58076: clk: qcom: gcc-sm6350: Add missing parent_map for two clocks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: qcom: gcc-sm6350: Add missing parent_map for two clocks

If a clk_rcg2 has a parent, it should also have parent_map defined,
otherwise we'll get a NULL pointer dereference when calling clk_set_rate
like the following:

  [    3.388105] Call trace:
  [    3.390664]  qcom_find_src_index+0x3c/0x70 (P)
  [    3.395301]  qcom_find_src_index+0x1c/0x70 (L)
  [    3.399934]  _freq_tbl_determine_rate+0x48/0x100
  [    3.404753]  clk_rcg2_determine_rate+0x1c/0x28
  [    3.409387]  clk_core_determine_round_nolock+0x58/0xe4
  [    3.421414]  clk_core_round_rate_nolock+0x48/0xfc
  [    3.432974]  clk_core_round_rate_nolock+0xd0/0xfc
  [    3.444483]  clk_core_set_rate_nolock+0x8c/0x300
  [    3.455886]  clk_set_rate+0x38/0x14c

Add the parent_map property for two clocks where it's missing and also
un-inline the parent_data as well to keep the matching parent_map and
parent_data together.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58076 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
