Subject: CVE-2024-50204: fs: don't try and remove empty rbtree node

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: don't try and remove empty rbtree node

When copying a namespace we won't have added the new copy into the
namespace rbtree until after the copy succeeded. Calling free_mnt_ns()
will try to remove the copy from the rbtree which is invalid. Simply
free the namespace skeleton directly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50204 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a8b155a2c30dc9a5ba837aa5fcba9a47cc031a9b
