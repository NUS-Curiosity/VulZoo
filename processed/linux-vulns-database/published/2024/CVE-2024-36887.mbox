Subject: CVE-2024-36887: e1000e: change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

e1000e: change usleep_range to udelay in PHY mdic access

This is a partial revert of commit 6dbdd4de0362 ("e1000e: Workaround
for sporadic MDI error on Meteor Lake systems"). The referenced commit
used usleep_range inside the PHY access routines, which are sometimes
called from an atomic context. This can lead to a kernel panic in some
scenarios, such as cable disconnection and reconnection on vPro systems.

Solve this by changing the usleep_range calls back to udelay.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36887 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
