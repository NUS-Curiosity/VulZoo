Subject: CVE-2024-26597: net: qualcomm: rmnet: fix global oob in rmnet_policy

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: qualcomm: rmnet: fix global oob in rmnet_policy

The variable rmnet_link_ops assign a *bigger* maxtype which leads to a
global out-of-bounds read when parsing the netlink attributes. See bug
trace below:

According to the comment of `nla_parse_nested_deprecated`, the maxtype
should be len(destination array) - 1. Hence use `IFLA_RMNET_MAX` here.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26597 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
