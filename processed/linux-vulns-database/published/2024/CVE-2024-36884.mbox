Subject: CVE-2024-36884: iommu/arm-smmu: Use the correct type in nvidia_smmu_context_fault()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/arm-smmu: Use the correct type in nvidia_smmu_context_fault()

This was missed because of the function pointer indirection.

nvidia_smmu_context_fault() is also installed as a irq function, and the
'void *' was changed to a struct arm_smmu_domain. Since the iommu_domain
is embedded at a non-zero offset this causes nvidia_smmu_context_fault()
to miscompute the offset. Fixup the types.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e83de8f05b998e227b48cdeea54cba4c9d66d3aa
