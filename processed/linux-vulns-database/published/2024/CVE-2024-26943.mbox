Subject: CVE-2024-26943: nouveau/dmem: handle kcalloc() allocation failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nouveau/dmem: handle kcalloc() allocation failure

The kcalloc() in nouveau_dmem_evict_chunk() will return null if
the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we dereference
src_pfns, dst_pfns or dma_addrs, the null pointer dereference bugs
will happen.

Moreover, the GPU is going away. If the kcalloc() fails, we could not
evict all pages mapping a chunk. So this patch adds a __GFP_NOFAIL
flag in kcalloc().

Finally, as there is no need to have physically contiguous memory,
this patch switches kcalloc() to kvcalloc() in order to avoid
failing allocations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26943 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
