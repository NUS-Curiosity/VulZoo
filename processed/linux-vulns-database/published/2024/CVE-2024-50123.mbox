Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Add the missing BPF_LINK_TYPE invocation for sockmap

There is an out-of-bounds read in bpf_link_show_fdinfo() for the sockmap
link fd. Fix it by adding the missing BPF_LINK_TYPE invocation for
sockmap link

Also add comments for bpf_link_type to prevent missing updates in the
future.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
