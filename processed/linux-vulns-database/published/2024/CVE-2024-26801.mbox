Subject: CVE-2024-26801: Bluetooth: Avoid potential use-after-free in hci_error_reset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: Avoid potential use-after-free in hci_error_reset

While handling the HCI_EV_HARDWARE_ERROR event, if the underlying
BT controller is not responding, the GPIO reset mechanism would
free the hci_dev and lead to a use-after-free in hci_error_reset.

Here's the call trace observed on a ChromeOS device with Intel AX201:
   queue_work_on+0x3e/0x6c
   __hci_cmd_sync_sk+0x2ee/0x4c0 [bluetooth <HASH:3b4a6>]
   ? init_wait_entry+0x31/0x31
   __hci_cmd_sync+0x16/0x20 [bluetooth <HASH:3b4a 6>]
   hci_error_reset+0x4f/0xa4 [bluetooth <HASH:3b4a 6>]
   process_one_work+0x1d8/0x33f
   worker_thread+0x21b/0x373
   kthread+0x13a/0x152
   ? pr_cont_work+0x54/0x54
   ? kthread_blkcg+0x31/0x31
    ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30

This patch holds the reference count on the hci_dev while processing
a HCI_EV_HARDWARE_ERROR event to avoid potential crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26801 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
