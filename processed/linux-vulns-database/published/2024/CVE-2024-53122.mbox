Subject: CVE-2024-53122: mptcp: cope racing subflow creation in mptcp_rcv_space_adjust

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: cope racing subflow creation in mptcp_rcv_space_adjust

Additional active subflows - i.e. created by the in kernel path
manager - are included into the subflow list before starting the
3whs.

A racing recvmsg() spooling data received on an already established
subflow would unconditionally call tcp_cleanup_rbuf() on all the
current subflows, potentially hitting a divide by zero error on
the newly created ones.

Explicitly check that the subflow is in a suitable state before
invoking tcp_cleanup_rbuf().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53122 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
