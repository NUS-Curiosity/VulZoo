Subject: CVE-2024-38566: bpf: Fix verifier assumptions about socket->sk

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix verifier assumptions about socket->sk

The verifier assumes that 'sk' field in 'struct socket' is valid
and non-NULL when 'socket' pointer itself is trusted and non-NULL.
That may not be the case when socket was just created and
passed to LSM socket_accept hook.
Fix this verifier assumption and adjust tests.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38566 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
