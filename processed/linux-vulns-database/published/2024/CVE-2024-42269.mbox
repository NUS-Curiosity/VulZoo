Subject: CVE-2024-42269: netfilter: iptables: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in ip6table_nat_table_init().

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: iptables: Fix potential null-ptr-deref in ip6table_nat_table_init().

ip6table_nat_table_init() accesses net->gen->ptr[ip6table_nat_net_ops.id],
but the function is exposed to user space before the entry is allocated
via register_pernet_subsys().

Let's call register_pernet_subsys() before xt_register_template().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42269 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
