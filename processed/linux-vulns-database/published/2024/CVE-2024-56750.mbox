Subject: CVE-2024-56750: erofs: fix blksize < PAGE_SIZE for file-backed mounts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix blksize < PAGE_SIZE for file-backed mounts

Adjust sb->s_blocksize{,_bits} directly for file-backed
mounts when the fs block size is smaller than PAGE_SIZE.

Previously, EROFS used sb_set_blocksize(), which caused
a panic if bdev-backed mounts is not used.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56750 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
