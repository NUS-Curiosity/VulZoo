Subject: CVE-2024-44994: iommu: Restore lost return in iommu_report_device_fault()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu: Restore lost return in iommu_report_device_fault()

When iommu_report_device_fault gets called with a partial fault it is
supposed to collect the fault into the group and then return.

Instead the return was accidently deleted which results in trying to
process the fault and an eventual crash.

Deleting the return was a typo, put it back.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44994 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cc6bc2ab1663ec9353636416af22452b078510e9
