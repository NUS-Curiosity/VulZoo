Subject: CVE-2024-56743: nfs_common: must not hold RCU while calling nfsd_file_put_local

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfs_common: must not hold RCU while calling nfsd_file_put_local

Move holding the RCU from nfs_to_nfsd_file_put_local to
nfs_to_nfsd_net_put.  It is the call to nfs_to->nfsd_serv_put that
requires the RCU anyway (the puts for nfsd_file and netns were
combined to avoid an extra indirect reference but that
micro-optimization isn't possible now).

This fixes xfstests generic/013 and it triggering:

"Voluntary context switch within RCU read-side critical section!"

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
