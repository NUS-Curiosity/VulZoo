Subject: CVE-2024-47666: scsi: pm80xx: Set phy->enable_completion only when we wait for it

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: pm80xx: Set phy->enable_completion only when we wait for it

pm8001_phy_control() populates the enable_completion pointer with a stack
address, sends a PHY_LINK_RESET / PHY_HARD_RESET, waits 300 ms, and
returns. The problem arises when a phy control response comes late.  After
300 ms the pm8001_phy_control() function returns and the passed
enable_completion stack address is no longer valid. Late phy control
response invokes complete() on a dangling enable_completion pointer which
leads to a kernel crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47666 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
