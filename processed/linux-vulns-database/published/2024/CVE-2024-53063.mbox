Subject: CVE-2024-53063: media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvbdev: prevent the risk of out of memory access

The dvbdev contains a static variable used to store dvb minors.

The behavior of it depends if CONFIG_DVB_DYNAMIC_MINORS is set
or not. When not set, dvb_register_device() won't check for
boundaries, as it will rely that a previous call to
dvb_register_adapter() would already be enforcing it.

On a similar way, dvb_device_open() uses the assumption
that the register functions already did the needed checks.

This can be fragile if some device ends using different
calls. This also generate warnings on static check analysers
like Coverity.

So, add explicit guards to prevent potential risk of OOM issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53063 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
