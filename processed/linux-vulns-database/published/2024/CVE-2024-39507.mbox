Subject: CVE-2024-39507: net: hns3: fix kernel crash problem in concurrent scenario

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: fix kernel crash problem in concurrent scenario

When link status change, the nic driver need to notify the roce
driver to handle this event, but at this time, the roce driver
may uninit, then cause kernel crash.

To fix the problem, when link status change, need to check
whether the roce registered, and when uninit, need to wait link
update finish.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39507 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
