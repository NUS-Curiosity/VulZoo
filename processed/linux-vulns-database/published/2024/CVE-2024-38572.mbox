Subject: CVE-2024-38572: wifi: ath12k: fix out-of-bound access of qmi_invoke_handler()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix out-of-bound access of qmi_invoke_handler()

Currently, there is no terminator entry for ath12k_qmi_msg_handlers hence
facing below KASAN warning,

 ==================================================================
 BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in qmi_invoke_handler+0xa4/0x148

 The address belongs to the variable:

 [...]
 ==================================================================

Add a dummy terminator entry at the end to assist the qmi_invoke_handler()
in traversing up to the terminator entry without accessing an
out-of-boundary index.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
