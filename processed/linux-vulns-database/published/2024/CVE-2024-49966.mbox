Subject: CVE-2024-49966: ocfs2: cancel dqi_sync_work before freeing oinfo

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: cancel dqi_sync_work before freeing oinfo

ocfs2_global_read_info() will initialize and schedule dqi_sync_work at the
end, if error occurs after successfully reading global quota, it will
trigger the following warning with CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS_* enabled:

ODEBUG: free active (active state 0) object: 00000000d8b0ce28 object type: timer_list hint: qsync_work_fn+0x0/0x16c

This reports that there is an active delayed work when freeing oinfo in
error handling, so cancel dqi_sync_work first.  BTW, return status instead
of -1 when .read_file_info fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49966 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
