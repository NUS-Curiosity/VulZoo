Subject: CVE-2024-38593: net: micrel: Fix receiving the timestamp in the frame for lan8841

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: micrel: Fix receiving the timestamp in the frame for lan8841

The blamed commit started to use the ptp workqueue to get the second
part of the timestamp. And when the port was set down, then this
workqueue is stopped. But if the config option NETWORK_PHY_TIMESTAMPING
is not enabled, then the ptp_clock is not initialized so then it would
crash when it would try to access the delayed work.
So then basically by setting up and then down the port, it would crash.
The fix consists in checking if the ptp_clock is initialized and only
then cancel the delayed work.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38593 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
