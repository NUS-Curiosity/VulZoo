Subject: CVE-2024-56715: ionic: Fix netdev notifier unregister on failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ionic: Fix netdev notifier unregister on failure

If register_netdev() fails, then the driver leaks the netdev notifier.
Fix this by calling ionic_lif_unregister() on register_netdev()
failure. This will also call ionic_lif_unregister_phc() if it has
already been registered.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56715 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
