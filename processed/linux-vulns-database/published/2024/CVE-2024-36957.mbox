Subject: CVE-2024-36957: octeontx2-af: avoid off-by-one read from userspace

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeontx2-af: avoid off-by-one read from userspace

We try to access count + 1 byte from userspace with memdup_user(buffer,
count + 1). However, the userspace only provides buffer of count bytes and
only these count bytes are verified to be okay to access. To ensure the
copied buffer is NUL terminated, we use memdup_user_nul instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36957 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
