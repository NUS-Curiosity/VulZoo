Subject: CVE-2024-57912: iio: pressure: zpa2326: fix information leak in triggered buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: pressure: zpa2326: fix information leak in triggered buffer

The 'sample' local struct is used to push data to user space from a
triggered buffer, but it has a hole between the temperature and the
timestamp (u32 pressure, u16 temperature, GAP, u64 timestamp).
This hole is never initialized.

Initialize the struct to zero before using it to avoid pushing
uninitialized information to userspace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57912 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
