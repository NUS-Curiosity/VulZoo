Subject: CVE-2024-34027: f2fs: compress: fix to cover {reserve,release}_compress_blocks() w/ cp_rwsem lock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: compress: fix to cover {reserve,release}_compress_blocks() w/ cp_rwsem lock

It needs to cover {reserve,release}_compress_blocks() w/ cp_rwsem lock
to avoid racing with checkpoint, otherwise, filesystem metadata including
blkaddr in dnode, inode fields and .total_valid_block_count may be
corrupted after SPO case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-34027 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
