Subject: CVE-2024-43822: ASoc: PCM6240: Return directly after a failed devm_kzalloc() in pcmdevice_i2c_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoc: PCM6240: Return directly after a failed devm_kzalloc() in pcmdevice_i2c_probe()

The value “-ENOMEM” was assigned to the local variable “ret”
in one if branch after a devm_kzalloc() call failed at the beginning.
This error code will trigger then a pcmdevice_remove() call with a passed
null pointer so that an undesirable dereference will be performed.
Thus return the appropriate error code directly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43822 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
