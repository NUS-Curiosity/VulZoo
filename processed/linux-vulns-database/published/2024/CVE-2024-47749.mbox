Subject: CVE-2024-47749: RDMA/cxgb4: Added NULL check for lookup_atid

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/cxgb4: Added NULL check for lookup_atid

The lookup_atid() function can return NULL if the ATID is
invalid or does not exist in the identifier table, which
could lead to dereferencing a null pointer without a
check in the `act_establish()` and `act_open_rpl()` functions.
Add a NULL check to prevent null pointer dereferencing.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47749 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
