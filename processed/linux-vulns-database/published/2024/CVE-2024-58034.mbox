Subject: CVE-2024-58034: memory: tegra20-emc: fix an OF node reference bug in tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

memory: tegra20-emc: fix an OF node reference bug in tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code()

As of_find_node_by_name() release the reference of the argument device
node, tegra_emc_find_node_by_ram_code() releases some device nodes while
still in use, resulting in possible UAFs. According to the bindings and
the in-tree DTS files, the "emc-tables" node is always device's child
node with the property "nvidia,use-ram-code", and the "lpddr2" node is a
child of the "emc-tables" node. Thus utilize the
for_each_child_of_node() macro and of_get_child_by_name() instead of
of_find_node_by_name() to simplify the code.

This bug was found by an experimental verification tool that I am
developing.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
