Subject: CVE-2024-42153: i2c: pnx: Fix potential deadlock warning from del_timer_sync() call in isr

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: pnx: Fix potential deadlock warning from del_timer_sync() call in isr

When del_timer_sync() is called in an interrupt context it throws a warning
because of potential deadlock. The timer is used only to exit from
wait_for_completion() after a timeout so replacing the call with
wait_for_completion_timeout() allows to remove the problematic timer and
its related functions altogether.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42153 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
