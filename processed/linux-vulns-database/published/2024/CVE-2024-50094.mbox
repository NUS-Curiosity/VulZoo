Subject: CVE-2024-50094: sfc: Don't invoke xdp_do_flush() from netpoll.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sfc: Don't invoke xdp_do_flush() from netpoll.

Yury reported a crash in the sfc driver originated from
netpoll_send_udp(). The netconsole sends a message and then netpoll
invokes the driver's NAPI function with a budget of zero. It is
dedicated to allow driver to free TX resources, that it may have used
while sending the packet.

In the netpoll case the driver invokes xdp_do_flush() unconditionally,
leading to crash because bpf_net_context was never assigned.

Invoke xdp_do_flush() only if budget is not zero.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50094 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
