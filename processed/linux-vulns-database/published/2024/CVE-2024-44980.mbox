Subject: CVE-2024-44980: drm/xe: Fix opregion leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Fix opregion leak

Being part o the display, ideally the setup and cleanup would be done by
display itself. However this is a bigger refactor that needs to be done
on both i915 and xe. For now, just fix the leak:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f7ecdd9853dd9f34e7cdfdadfb70b8f40644ebb4
