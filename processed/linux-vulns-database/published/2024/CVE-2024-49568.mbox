Subject: CVE-2024-49568: net/smc: check v2_ext_offset/eid_cnt/ism_gid_cnt when receiving proposal msg

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: check v2_ext_offset/eid_cnt/ism_gid_cnt when receiving proposal msg

When receiving proposal msg in server, the fields v2_ext_offset/
eid_cnt/ism_gid_cnt in proposal msg are from the remote client
and can not be fully trusted. Especially the field v2_ext_offset,
once exceed the max value, there has the chance to access wrong
address, and crash may happen.

This patch checks the fields v2_ext_offset/eid_cnt/ism_gid_cnt
before using them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49568 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
