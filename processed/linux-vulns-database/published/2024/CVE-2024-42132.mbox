Subject: CVE-2024-42132: bluetooth/hci: disallow setting handle bigger than HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bluetooth/hci: disallow setting handle bigger than HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX

Syzbot hit warning in hci_conn_del() caused by freeing handle that was
not allocated using ida allocator.

This is caused by handle bigger than HCI_CONN_HANDLE_MAX passed by
hci_le_big_sync_established_evt(), which makes code think it's unset
connection.

Add same check for handle upper bound as in hci_conn_set_handle() to
prevent warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42132 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
