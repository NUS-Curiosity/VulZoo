Subject: CVE-2024-42241: mm/shmem: disable PMD-sized page cache if needed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/shmem: disable PMD-sized page cache if needed

For shmem files, it's possible that PMD-sized page cache can't be
supported by xarray.  For example, 512MB page cache on ARM64 when the base
page size is 64KB can't be supported by xarray.  It leads to errors as the
following messages indicate when this sort of xarray entry is split.

Fix it by disabling PMD-sized page cache when HPAGE_PMD_ORDER is larger
than MAX_PAGECACHE_ORDER.  As Matthew Wilcox pointed, the page cache in a
shmem file isn't represented by a multi-index entry and doesn't have this
limitation when the xarry entry is split until commit 6b24ca4a1a8d ("mm:
Use multi-index entries in the page cache").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42241 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
