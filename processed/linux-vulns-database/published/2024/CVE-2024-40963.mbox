Subject: CVE-2024-40963: mips: bmips: BCM6358: make sure CBR is correctly set

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mips: bmips: BCM6358: make sure CBR is correctly set

It was discovered that some device have CBR address set to 0 causing
kernel panic when arch_sync_dma_for_cpu_all is called.

This was notice in situation where the system is booted from TP1 and
BMIPS_GET_CBR() returns 0 instead of a valid address and
!!(read_c0_brcm_cmt_local() & (1 << 31)); not failing.

The current check whether RAC flush should be disabled or not are not
enough hence lets check if CBR is a valid address or not.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40963 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
