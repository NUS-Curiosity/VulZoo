Subject: CVE-2024-27063: leds: trigger: netdev: Fix kernel panic on interface rename trig notify

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

leds: trigger: netdev: Fix kernel panic on interface rename trig notify

Commit d5e01266e7f5 ("leds: trigger: netdev: add additional specific link
speed mode") in the various changes, reworked the way to set the LINKUP
mode in commit cee4bd16c319 ("leds: trigger: netdev: Recheck
NETDEV_LED_MODE_LINKUP on dev rename") and moved it to a generic function.

This changed the logic where, in the previous implementation the dev
from the trigger event was used to check if the carrier was ok, but in
the new implementation with the generic function, the dev in
trigger_data is used instead.

This is problematic and cause a possible kernel panic due to the fact
that the dev in the trigger_data still reference the old one as the
new one (passed from the trigger event) still has to be hold and saved
in the trigger_data struct (done in the NETDEV_REGISTER case).

On calling of get_device_state(), an invalid net_dev is used and this
cause a kernel panic.

To handle this correctly, move the call to get_device_state() after the
new net_dev is correctly set in trigger_data (in the NETDEV_REGISTER
case) and correctly parse the new dev.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27063 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
