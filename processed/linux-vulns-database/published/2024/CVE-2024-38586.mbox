Subject: CVE-2024-38586: r8169: Fix possible ring buffer corruption on fragmented Tx packets.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

r8169: Fix possible ring buffer corruption on fragmented Tx packets.

An issue was found on the RTL8125b when transmitting small fragmented
packets, whereby invalid entries were inserted into the transmit ring
buffer, subsequently leading to calls to dma_unmap_single() with a null
address.

This was caused by rtl8169_start_xmit() not noticing changes to nr_frags
which may occur when small packets are padded (to work around hardware
quirks) in rtl8169_tso_csum_v2().

To fix this, postpone inspecting nr_frags until after any padding has been
applied.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38586 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
