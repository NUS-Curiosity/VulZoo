Subject: CVE-2024-38663: blk-cgroup: fix list corruption from resetting io stat

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-cgroup: fix list corruption from resetting io stat

Since commit 3b8cc6298724 ("blk-cgroup: Optimize blkcg_rstat_flush()"),
each iostat instance is added to blkcg percpu list, so blkcg_reset_stats()
can't reset the stat instance by memset(), otherwise the llist may be
corrupted.

Fix the issue by only resetting the counter part.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38663 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
