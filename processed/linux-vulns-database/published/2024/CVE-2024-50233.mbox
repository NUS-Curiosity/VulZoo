Subject: CVE-2024-50233: staging: iio: frequency: ad9832: fix division by zero in ad9832_calc_freqreg()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: iio: frequency: ad9832: fix division by zero in ad9832_calc_freqreg()

In the ad9832_write_frequency() function, clk_get_rate() might return 0.
This can lead to a division by zero when calling ad9832_calc_freqreg().
The check if (fout > (clk_get_rate(st->mclk) / 2)) does not protect
against the case when fout is 0. The ad9832_write_frequency() function
is called from ad9832_write(), and fout is derived from a text buffer,
which can contain any value.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50233 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
