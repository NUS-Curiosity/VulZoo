Subject: CVE-2024-27021: r8169: fix LED-related deadlock on module removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

r8169: fix LED-related deadlock on module removal

Binding devm_led_classdev_register() to the netdev is problematic
because on module removal we get a RTNL-related deadlock. Fix this
by avoiding the device-managed LED functions.

Note: We can safely call led_classdev_unregister() for a LED even
if registering it failed, because led_classdev_unregister() detects
this and is a no-op in this case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27021 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
