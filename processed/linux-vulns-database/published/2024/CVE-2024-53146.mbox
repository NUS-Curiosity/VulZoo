Subject: CVE-2024-53146: NFSD: Prevent a potential integer overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Prevent a potential integer overflow

If the tag length is >= U32_MAX - 3 then the "length + 4" addition
can result in an integer overflow. Address this by splitting the
decoding into several steps so that decode_cb_compound4res() does
not have to perform arithmetic on the unsafe length value.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53146 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
