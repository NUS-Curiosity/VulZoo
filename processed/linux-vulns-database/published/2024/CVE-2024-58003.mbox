Subject: CVE-2024-58003: media: i2c: ds90ub9x3: Fix extra fwnode_handle_put()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: i2c: ds90ub9x3: Fix extra fwnode_handle_put()

The ub913 and ub953 drivers call fwnode_handle_put(priv->sd.fwnode) as
part of their remove process, and if the driver is removed multiple
times, eventually leads to put "overflow", possibly causing memory
corruption or crash.

The fwnode_handle_put() is a leftover from commit 905f88ccebb1 ("media:
i2c: ds90ub9x3: Fix sub-device matching"), which changed the code
related to the sd.fwnode, but missed removing these fwnode_handle_put()
calls.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58003 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
