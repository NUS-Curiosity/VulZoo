Subject: CVE-2024-41006: netrom: Fix a memory leak in nr_heartbeat_expiry()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netrom: Fix a memory leak in nr_heartbeat_expiry()

syzbot reported a memory leak in nr_create() [0].

Commit 409db27e3a2e ("netrom: Fix use-after-free of a listening socket.")
added sock_hold() to the nr_heartbeat_expiry() function, where
a) a socket has a SOCK_DESTROY flag or
b) a listening socket has a SOCK_DEAD flag.

But in the case "a," when the SOCK_DESTROY flag is set, the file descriptor
has already been closed and the nr_release() function has been called.
So it makes no sense to hold the reference count because no one will
call another nr_destroy_socket() and put it as in the case "b."

nr_connect
  nr_establish_data_link
    nr_start_heartbeat

nr_release
  switch (nr->state)
  case NR_STATE_3
    nr->state = NR_STATE_2
    sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_DESTROY);

                        nr_rx_frame
                          nr_process_rx_frame
                            switch (nr->state)
                            case NR_STATE_2
                              nr_state2_machine()
                                nr_disconnect()
                                  nr_sk(sk)->state = NR_STATE_0
                                  sock_set_flag(sk, SOCK_DEAD)

                        nr_heartbeat_expiry
                          switch (nr->state)
                          case NR_STATE_0
                            if (sock_flag(sk, SOCK_DESTROY) ||
                               (sk->sk_state == TCP_LISTEN
                                 && sock_flag(sk, SOCK_DEAD)))
                               sock_hold()  // ( !!! )
                               nr_destroy_socket()

To fix the memory leak, let's call sock_hold() only for a listening socket.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
