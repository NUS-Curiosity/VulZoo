Subject: CVE-2024-42092: gpio: davinci: Validate the obtained number of IRQs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpio: davinci: Validate the obtained number of IRQs

Value of pdata->gpio_unbanked is taken from Device Tree. In case of broken
DT due to any error this value can be any. Without this value validation
there can be out of chips->irqs array boundaries access in
davinci_gpio_probe().

Validate the obtained nirq value so that it won't exceed the maximum
number of IRQs per bank.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42092 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
