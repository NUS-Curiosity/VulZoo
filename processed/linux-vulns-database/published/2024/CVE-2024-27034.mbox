Subject: CVE-2024-27034: f2fs: compress: fix to cover normal cluster write with cp_rwsem

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: compress: fix to cover normal cluster write with cp_rwsem

When we overwrite compressed cluster w/ normal cluster, we should
not unlock cp_rwsem during f2fs_write_raw_pages(), otherwise data
will be corrupted if partial blocks were persisted before CP & SPOR,
due to cluster metadata wasn't updated atomically.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27034 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
