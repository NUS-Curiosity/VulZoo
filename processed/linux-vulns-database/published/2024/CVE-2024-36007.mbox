Subject: CVE-2024-36007: mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix warning during rehash

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix warning during rehash

As previously explained, the rehash delayed work migrates filters from
one region to another. This is done by iterating over all chunks (all
the filters with the same priority) in the region and in each chunk
iterating over all the filters.

When the work runs out of credits it stores the current chunk and entry
as markers in the per-work context so that it would know where to resume
the migration from the next time the work is scheduled.

Upon error, the chunk marker is reset to NULL, but without resetting the
entry markers despite being relative to it. This can result in migration
being resumed from an entry that does not belong to the chunk being
migrated. In turn, this will eventually lead to a chunk being iterated
over as if it is an entry. Because of how the two structures happen to
be defined, this does not lead to KASAN splats, but to warnings such as
[1].

Fix by creating a helper that resets all the markers and call it from
all the places the currently only reset the chunk marker. For good
measures also call it when starting a completely new rehash. Add a
warning to avoid future cases.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
