Subject: CVE-2024-46693: soc: qcom: pmic_glink: Fix race during initialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: pmic_glink: Fix race during initialization

As pointed out by Stephen Boyd it is possible that during initialization
of the pmic_glink child drivers, the protection-domain notifiers fires,
and the associated work is scheduled, before the client registration
returns and as a result the local "client" pointer has been initialized.

The outcome of this is a NULL pointer dereference as the "client"
pointer is blindly dereferenced.

Timeline provided by Stephen:
 CPU0                               CPU1
 ----                               ----
 ucsi->client = NULL;
 devm_pmic_glink_register_client()
  client->pdr_notify(client->priv, pg->client_state)
   pmic_glink_ucsi_pdr_notify()
    schedule_work(&ucsi->register_work)
    <schedule away>
                                    pmic_glink_ucsi_register()
                                     ucsi_register()
                                      pmic_glink_ucsi_read_version()
                                       pmic_glink_ucsi_read()
                                        pmic_glink_ucsi_read()
                                         pmic_glink_send(ucsi->client)
                                         <client is NULL BAD>
 ucsi->client = client // Too late!

This code is identical across the altmode, battery manager and usci
child drivers.

Resolve this by splitting the allocation of the "client" object and the
registration thereof into two operations.

This only happens if the protection domain registry is populated at the
time of registration, which by the introduction of commit '1ebcde047c54
("soc: qcom: add pd-mapper implementation")' became much more likely.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46693 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
