This means that on 839.350575, the event ib_cache_event_task was sent andi
queued in ib_wq.

2). In the link [1],

"

This means that on 850.559070, this slab-use-after-free problem occurred.

In all, on 839.350575, the event ib_cache_event_task was sent and queued
in ib_wq,

before 843.251853, the net device veth was freed.

on 850.559070, this event was executed, and the mentioned freed net device
was called. Thus, the above call trace occurred.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
