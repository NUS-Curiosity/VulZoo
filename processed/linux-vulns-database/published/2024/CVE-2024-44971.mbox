Subject: CVE-2024-44971: net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix a possible memory leak in bcm_sf2_mdio_register()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix a possible memory leak in bcm_sf2_mdio_register()

bcm_sf2_mdio_register() calls of_phy_find_device() and then
phy_device_remove() in a loop to remove existing PHY devices.
of_phy_find_device() eventually calls bus_find_device(), which calls
get_device() on the returned struct device * to increment the refcount.
The current implementation does not decrement the refcount, which causes
memory leak.

This commit adds the missing phy_device_free() call to decrement the
refcount via put_device() to balance the refcount.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44971 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
