Subject: CVE-2024-56550: s390/stacktrace: Use break instead of return statement

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/stacktrace: Use break instead of return statement

arch_stack_walk_user_common() contains a return statement instead of a
break statement in case store_ip() fails while trying to store a callchain
entry of a user space process.
This may lead to a missing pagefault_enable() call.

If this happens any subsequent page fault of the process won't be resolved
by the page fault handler and this in turn will lead to the process being
killed.

Use a break instead of a return statement to fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56550 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
