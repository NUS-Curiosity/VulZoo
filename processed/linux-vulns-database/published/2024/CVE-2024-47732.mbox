Subject: CVE-2024-47732: crypto: iaa - Fix potential use after free bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: iaa - Fix potential use after free bug

The free_device_compression_mode(iaa_device, device_mode) function frees
"device_mode" but it iss passed to iaa_compression_modes[i]->free() a few
lines later resulting in a use after free.

The good news is that, so far as I can tell, nothing implements the
->free() function and the use after free happens in dead code.  But, with
this fix, when something does implement it, we'll be ready.  :)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47732 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
