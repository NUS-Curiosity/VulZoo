Subject: CVE-2024-26776: spi: hisi-sfc-v3xx: Return IRQ_NONE if no interrupts were detected

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: hisi-sfc-v3xx: Return IRQ_NONE if no interrupts were detected

Return IRQ_NONE from the interrupt handler when no interrupt was
detected. Because an empty interrupt will cause a null pointer error:

    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual
  address 0000000000000008
    Call trace:
        complete+0x54/0x100
        hisi_sfc_v3xx_isr+0x2c/0x40 [spi_hisi_sfc_v3xx]
        __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x64/0x1e0
        handle_irq_event+0x7c/0x1cc

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26776 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
