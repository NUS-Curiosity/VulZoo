Subject: CVE-2024-46674: usb: dwc3: st: fix probed platform device ref count on probe error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: st: fix probed platform device ref count on probe error path

The probe function never performs any paltform device allocation, thus
error path "undo_platform_dev_alloc" is entirely bogus.  It drops the
reference count from the platform device being probed.  If error path is
triggered, this will lead to unbalanced device reference counts and
premature release of device resources, thus possible use-after-free when
releasing remaining devm-managed resources.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46674 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
