Subject: CVE-2024-35930: scsi: lpfc: Fix possible memory leak in lpfc_rcv_padisc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix possible memory leak in lpfc_rcv_padisc()

The call to lpfc_sli4_resume_rpi() in lpfc_rcv_padisc() may return an
unsuccessful status.  In such cases, the elsiocb is not issued, the
completion is not called, and thus the elsiocb resource is leaked.

Check return value after calling lpfc_sli4_resume_rpi() and conditionally
release the elsiocb resource.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35930 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
