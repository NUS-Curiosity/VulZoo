Subject: CVE-2024-42094: net/iucv: Avoid explicit cpumask var allocation on stack

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/iucv: Avoid explicit cpumask var allocation on stack

For CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK=y kernel, explicit allocation of cpumask
variable on stack is not recommended since it can cause potential stack
overflow.

Instead, kernel code should always use *cpumask_var API(s) to allocate
cpumask var in config-neutral way, leaving allocation strategy to
CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK.

Use *cpumask_var API(s) to address it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42094 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
