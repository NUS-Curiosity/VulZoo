Subject: CVE-2024-39293: Revert "xsk: Support redirect to any socket bound to the same umem"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "xsk: Support redirect to any socket bound to the same umem"

This reverts commit 2863d665ea41282379f108e4da6c8a2366ba66db.

This patch introduced a potential kernel crash when multiple napi instances
redirect to the same AF_XDP socket. By removing the queue_index check, it is
possible for multiple napi instances to access the Rx ring at the same time,
which will result in a corrupted ring state which can lead to a crash when
flushing the rings in __xsk_flush(). This can happen when the linked list of
sockets to flush gets corrupted by concurrent accesses. A quick and small fix
is not possible, so let us revert this for now.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39293 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.9.5 with commit 19cb40b10645
	Fixed in 6.10 with commit 7fcf26b315bb

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
