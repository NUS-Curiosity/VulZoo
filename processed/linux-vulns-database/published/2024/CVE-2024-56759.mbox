Subject: CVE-2024-56759: btrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled

When a COWing a tree block, at btrfs_cow_block(), and we have the
tracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled
(CONFIG_PREEMPT=y), we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent
buffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths
that call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding
the last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()
drops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls
free_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent
buffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,
the current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()
and the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()
is called, resulting in a use-after-free.

Fix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to
btrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.
This also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag
code, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is
called there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56759 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
