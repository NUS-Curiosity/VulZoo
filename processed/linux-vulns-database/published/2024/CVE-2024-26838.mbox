The issue is that a tasklet could be pending on another core racing
the delete of the irq.

Fix by insuring any scheduled tasklet is killed after deleting the
irq.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26838 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
