Subject: CVE-2024-53167: nfs/blocklayout: Don't attempt unregister for invalid block device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfs/blocklayout: Don't attempt unregister for invalid block device

Since commit d869da91cccb ("nfs/blocklayout: Fix premature PR key
unregistration") an unmount of a pNFS SCSI layout-enabled NFS may
dereference a NULL block_device in:

  bl_unregister_scsi+0x16/0xe0 [blocklayoutdriver]
  bl_free_device+0x70/0x80 [blocklayoutdriver]
  bl_free_deviceid_node+0x12/0x30 [blocklayoutdriver]
  nfs4_put_deviceid_node+0x60/0xc0 [nfsv4]
  nfs4_deviceid_purge_client+0x132/0x190 [nfsv4]
  unset_pnfs_layoutdriver+0x59/0x60 [nfsv4]
  nfs4_destroy_server+0x36/0x70 [nfsv4]
  nfs_free_server+0x23/0xe0 [nfs]
  deactivate_locked_super+0x30/0xb0
  cleanup_mnt+0xba/0x150
  task_work_run+0x59/0x90
  syscall_exit_to_user_mode+0x217/0x220
  do_syscall_64+0x8e/0x160

This happens because even though we were able to create the
nfs4_deviceid_node, the lookup for the device was unable to attach the
block device to the pnfs_block_dev.

If we never found a block device to register, we can avoid this case with
the PNFS_BDEV_REGISTERED flag.  Move the deref behind the test for the
flag.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53167 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3402704a424f34bbcca7f4a4503859357f422217
