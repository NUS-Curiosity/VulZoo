Subject: CVE-2024-50159: firmware: arm_scmi: Fix the double free in scmi_debugfs_common_setup()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: arm_scmi: Fix the double free in scmi_debugfs_common_setup()

Clang static checker(scan-build) throws below warningï¼š
  |  drivers/firmware/arm_scmi/driver.c:line 2915, column 2
  |        Attempt to free released memory.

When devm_add_action_or_reset() fails, scmi_debugfs_common_cleanup()
will run twice which causes double free of 'dbg->name'.

Remove the redundant scmi_debugfs_common_cleanup() to fix this problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50159 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
