Subject: CVE-2024-53148: comedi: Flush partial mappings in error case

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

comedi: Flush partial mappings in error case

If some remap_pfn_range() calls succeeded before one failed, we still have
buffer pages mapped into the userspace page tables when we drop the buffer
reference with comedi_buf_map_put(bm). The userspace mappings are only
cleaned up later in the mmap error path.

Fix it by explicitly flushing all mappings in our VMA on the error path.

See commit 79a61cc3fc04 ("mm: avoid leaving partial pfn mappings around in
error case").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53148 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
