Subject: CVE-2024-49928: wifi: rtw89: avoid reading out of bounds when loading TX power FW elements

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw89: avoid reading out of bounds when loading TX power FW elements

Because the loop-expression will do one more time before getting false from
cond-expression, the original code copied one more entry size beyond valid
region.

Fix it by moving the entry copy to loop-body.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49928 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
