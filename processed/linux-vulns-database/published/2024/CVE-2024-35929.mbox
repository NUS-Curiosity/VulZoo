Subject: CVE-2024-35929: rcu/nocb: Fix WARN_ON_ONCE() in the rcu_nocb_bypass_lock()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu/nocb: Fix WARN_ON_ONCE() in the rcu_nocb_bypass_lock()

For the kernels built with CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU_DEFAULT_ALL=y and
CONFIG_RCU_LAZY=y, the following scenarios will trigger WARN_ON_ONCE()
in the rcu_nocb_bypass_lock() and rcu_nocb_wait_contended() functions:

        CPU2                                               CPU11
kthread
rcu_nocb_cb_kthread                                       ksys_write
rcu_do_batch                                              vfs_write
rcu_torture_timer_cb                                      proc_sys_write
__kmem_cache_free                                         proc_sys_call_handler
kmemleak_free                                             drop_caches_sysctl_handler
delete_object_full                                        drop_slab
__delete_object                                           shrink_slab
put_object                                                lazy_rcu_shrink_scan
call_rcu                                                  rcu_nocb_flush_bypass
__call_rcu_commn                                            rcu_nocb_bypass_lock
                                                            raw_spin_trylock(&rdp->nocb_bypass_lock) fail
                                                            atomic_inc(&rdp->nocb_lock_contended);
rcu_nocb_wait_contended                                     WARN_ON_ONCE(smp_processor_id() != rdp->cpu);
 WARN_ON_ONCE(atomic_read(&rdp->nocb_lock_contended))                                          |
                            |_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _same rdp and rdp->cpu != 11_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ __|

Reproduce this bug with "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches".

This commit therefore uses rcu_nocb_try_flush_bypass() instead of
rcu_nocb_flush_bypass() in lazy_rcu_shrink_scan().  If the nocb_bypass
queue is being flushed, then rcu_nocb_try_flush_bypass will return
directly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35929 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4d58c9fb45c70e62c19e8be3f3605889c47601bc
