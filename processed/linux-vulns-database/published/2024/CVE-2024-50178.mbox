Subject: CVE-2024-50178: cpufreq: loongson3: Use raw_smp_processor_id() in do_service_request()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpufreq: loongson3: Use raw_smp_processor_id() in do_service_request()

Use raw_smp_processor_id() instead of plain smp_processor_id() in
do_service_request(), otherwise we may get some errors with the driver
enabled:

 BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: (udev-worker)/208
 caller is loongson3_cpufreq_probe+0x5c/0x250 [loongson3_cpufreq]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2f78e4a6d2702ac03c2bf2ed3a0e344e1fa9f967
