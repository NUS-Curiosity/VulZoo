Subject: CVE-2024-35807: ext4: fix corruption during on-line resize

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix corruption during on-line resize

We observed a corruption during on-line resize of a file system that is
larger than 16 TiB with 4k block size. With having more then 2^32 blocks
resize_inode is turned off by default by mke2fs. The issue can be
reproduced on a smaller file system for convenience by explicitly
turning off resize_inode. An on-line resize across an 8 GiB boundary (the
size of a meta block group in this setup) then leads to a corruption:

  dev=/dev/<some_dev> # should be >= 16 GiB
  mkdir -p /corruption
  /sbin/mke2fs -t ext4 -b 4096 -O ^resize_inode $dev $((2 * 2**21 - 2**15))
  mount -t ext4 $dev /corruption

  dd if=/dev/zero bs=4096 of=/corruption/test count=$((2*2**21 - 4*2**15))
  sha1sum /corruption/test
  # 79d2658b39dcfd77274e435b0934028adafaab11  /corruption/test

  /sbin/resize2fs $dev $((2*2**21))
  # drop page cache to force reload the block from disk
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

  sha1sum /corruption/test
  # 3c2abc63cbf1a94c9e6977e0fbd72cd832c4d5c3  /corruption/test

2^21 = 2^15*2^6 equals 8 GiB whereof 2^15 is the number of blocks per
block group and 2^6 are the number of block groups that make a meta
block group.

The last checksum might be different depending on how the file is laid
out across the physical blocks. The actual corruption occurs at physical
block 63*2^15 = 2064384 which would be the location of the backup of the
meta block group's block descriptor. During the on-line resize the file
system will be converted to meta_bg starting at s_first_meta_bg which is
2 in the example - meaning all block groups after 16 GiB. However, in
ext4_flex_group_add we might add block groups that are not part of the
first meta block group yet. In the reproducer we achieved this by
substracting the size of a whole block group from the point where the
meta block group would start. This must be considered when updating the
backup block group descriptors to follow the non-meta_bg layout. The fix
is to add a test whether the group to add is already part of the meta
block group or not.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35807 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
