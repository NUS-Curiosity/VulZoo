Subject: CVE-2024-27008: drm: nv04: Fix out of bounds access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: nv04: Fix out of bounds access

When Output Resource (dcb->or) value is assigned in
fabricate_dcb_output(), there may be out of bounds access to
dac_users array in case dcb->or is zero because ffs(dcb->or) is
used as index there.
The 'or' argument of fabricate_dcb_output() must be interpreted as a
number of bit to set, not value.

Utilize macros from 'enum nouveau_or' in calls instead of hardcoding.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27008 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
