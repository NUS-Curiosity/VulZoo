Subject: CVE-2024-42304: ext4: make sure the first directory block is not a hole

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: make sure the first directory block is not a hole

The syzbot constructs a directory that has no dirblock but is non-inline,
i.e. the first directory block is a hole. And no errors are reported when
creating files in this directory in the following flow.

    ext4_mknod
     ...
      ext4_add_entry
        // Read block 0
        ext4_read_dirblock(dir, block, DIRENT)
          bh = ext4_bread(NULL, inode, block, 0)
          if (!bh && (type == INDEX || type == DIRENT_HTREE))
          // The first directory block is a hole
          // But type == DIRENT, so no error is reported.

After that, we get a directory block without '.' and '..' but with a valid
dentry. This may cause some code that relies on dot or dotdot (such as
make_indexed_dir()) to crash.

Therefore when ext4_read_dirblock() finds that the first directory block
is a hole report that the filesystem is corrupted and return an error to
avoid loading corrupted data from disk causing something bad.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42304 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
