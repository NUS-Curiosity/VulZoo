Subject: CVE-2024-57978: media: imx-jpeg: Fix potential error pointer dereference in detach_pm()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: imx-jpeg: Fix potential error pointer dereference in detach_pm()

The proble is on the first line:

	if (jpeg->pd_dev[i] && !pm_runtime_suspended(jpeg->pd_dev[i]))

If jpeg->pd_dev[i] is an error pointer, then passing it to
pm_runtime_suspended() will lead to an Oops.  The other conditions
check for both error pointers and NULL, but it would be more clear to
use the IS_ERR_OR_NULL() check for that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57978 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
