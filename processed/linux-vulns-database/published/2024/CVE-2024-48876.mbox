Subject: CVE-2024-48876: stackdepot: fix stack_depot_save_flags() in NMI context

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

stackdepot: fix stack_depot_save_flags() in NMI context

Per documentation, stack_depot_save_flags() was meant to be usable from
NMI context if STACK_DEPOT_FLAG_CAN_ALLOC is unset.  However, it still
would try to take the pool_lock in an attempt to save a stack trace in the
current pool (if space is available).

This could result in deadlock if an NMI is handled while pool_lock is
already held.  To avoid deadlock, only try to take the lock in NMI context
and give up if unsuccessful.

The documentation is fixed to clearly convey this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-48876 to this issue.

	include/linux/stackdepot.h
	lib/stackdepot.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9bfeeeff2c92b9dd261198b601b45bde4c529841
