Subject: CVE-2024-41053: scsi: ufs: core: Fix ufshcd_abort_one racing issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix ufshcd_abort_one racing issue

When ufshcd_abort_one is racing with the completion ISR, the completed tag
of the request's mq_hctx pointer will be set to NULL by ISR.  Return
success when request is completed by ISR because ufshcd_abort_one does not
need to do anything.

The racing flow is:

Thread A
ufshcd_err_handler					step 1
	...
	ufshcd_abort_one
		ufshcd_try_to_abort_task
			ufshcd_cmd_inflight(true)	step 3
		ufshcd_mcq_req_to_hwq
			blk_mq_unique_tag
				rq->mq_hctx->queue_num	step 5

Thread B
ufs_mtk_mcq_intr(cq complete ISR)			step 2
	scsi_done
		...
		__blk_mq_free_request
			rq->mq_hctx = NULL;		step 4

Below is KE back trace.
  ufshcd_try_to_abort_task: cmd at tag 41 not pending in the device.
  ufshcd_try_to_abort_task: cmd at tag=41 is cleared.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c3111b3cf3889bfa7b73ebff83d7397db9b7e5e0
