Subject: CVE-2024-46824: iommufd: Require drivers to supply the cache_invalidate_user ops

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd: Require drivers to supply the cache_invalidate_user ops

If drivers don't do this then iommufd will oops invalidation ioctls with
something like:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000
  Mem abort info:
    ESR = 0x0000000086000004

All existing drivers implement this op for nesting, this is mostly a
bisection aid.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/89827a4de802765b1ebb401fc1e73a90108c7520
