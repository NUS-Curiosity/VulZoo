Subject: CVE-2024-39470: eventfs: Fix a possible null pointer dereference in eventfs_find_events()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eventfs: Fix a possible null pointer dereference in eventfs_find_events()

In function eventfs_find_events,there is a potential null pointer
that may be caused by calling update_events_attr which will perform
some operations on the members of the ei struct when ei is NULL.

Hence,When ei->is_freed is set,return NULL directly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39470 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
