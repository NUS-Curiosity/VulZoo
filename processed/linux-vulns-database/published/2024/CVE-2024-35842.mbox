Subject: CVE-2024-35842: ASoC: mediatek: sof-common: Add NULL check for normal_link string

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: mediatek: sof-common: Add NULL check for normal_link string

It's not granted that all entries of struct sof_conn_stream declare
a `normal_link` (a non-SOF, direct link) string, and this is the case
for SoCs that support only SOF paths (hence do not support both direct
and SOF usecases).

For example, in the case of MT8188 there is no normal_link string in
any of the sof_conn_stream entries and there will be more drivers
doing that in the future.

To avoid possible NULL pointer KPs, add a NULL check for `normal_link`.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35842 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
