Subject: CVE-2024-35811: wifi: brcmfmac: Fix use-after-free bug in brcmf_cfg80211_detach

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: Fix use-after-free bug in brcmf_cfg80211_detach

This is the candidate patch of CVE-2023-47233 :
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47233

In brcm80211 driver,it starts with the following invoking chain
to start init a timeout worker:

->brcmf_usb_probe
  ->brcmf_usb_probe_cb
    ->brcmf_attach
      ->brcmf_bus_started
        ->brcmf_cfg80211_attach
          ->wl_init_priv
            ->brcmf_init_escan
              ->INIT_WORK(&cfg->escan_timeout_work,
		  brcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker);

If we disconnect the USB by hotplug, it will call
brcmf_usb_disconnect to make cleanup. The invoking chain is :

brcmf_usb_disconnect
  ->brcmf_usb_disconnect_cb
    ->brcmf_detach
      ->brcmf_cfg80211_detach
        ->kfree(cfg);

While the timeout woker may still be running. This will cause
a use-after-free bug on cfg in brcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker.

Fix it by deleting the timer and canceling the worker in
brcmf_cfg80211_detach.

[arend.vanspriel@broadcom.com: keep timer delete as is and cancel work just before free]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35811 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
