Subject: CVE-2024-53049: slub/kunit: fix a WARNING due to unwrapped __kmalloc_cache_noprof

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

slub/kunit: fix a WARNING due to unwrapped __kmalloc_cache_noprof

'modprobe slub_kunit' will have a warning as shown below. The root cause
is that __kmalloc_cache_noprof was directly used, which resulted in no
alloc_tag being allocated. This caused current->alloc_tag to be null,
leading to a warning in alloc_tag_add_check.

Let's add an alloc_hook layer to __kmalloc_cache_noprof specifically
within lib/slub_kunit.c, which is the only user of this internal slub
function outside kmalloc implementation itself.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/79aea7dfd98fbbf282d1408fc21849fc9a677768
