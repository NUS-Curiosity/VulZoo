Subject: CVE-2024-39474: mm/vmalloc: fix vmalloc which may return null if called with __GFP_NOFAIL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/vmalloc: fix vmalloc which may return null if called with __GFP_NOFAIL

commit a421ef303008 ("mm: allow !GFP_KERNEL allocations for kvmalloc")
includes support for __GFP_NOFAIL, but it presents a conflict with commit
dd544141b9eb ("vmalloc: back off when the current task is OOM-killed").  A
possible scenario is as follows:

process-a
__vmalloc_node_range(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NOFAIL)
    __vmalloc_area_node()
        vm_area_alloc_pages()
		--> oom-killer send SIGKILL to process-a
        if (fatal_signal_pending(current)) break;
--> return NULL;

To fix this, do not check fatal_signal_pending() in vm_area_alloc_pages()
if __GFP_NOFAIL set.

This issue occurred during OPLUS KASAN TEST. Below is part of the log
-> oom-killer sends signal to process
[65731.222840] [ T1308] oom-kill:constraint=CONSTRAINT_NONE,nodemask=(null),cpuset=/,mems_allowed=0,global_oom,task_memcg=/apps/uid_10198,task=gs.intelligence,pid=32454,uid=10198

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
