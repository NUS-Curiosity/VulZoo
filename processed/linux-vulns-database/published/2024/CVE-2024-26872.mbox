Subject: CVE-2024-26872: RDMA/srpt: Do not register event handler until srpt device is fully setup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/srpt: Do not register event handler until srpt device is fully setup

Upon rare occasions, KASAN reports a use-after-free Write
in srpt_refresh_port().

This seems to be because an event handler is registered before the
srpt device is fully setup and a race condition upon error may leave a
partially setup event handler in place.

Instead, only register the event handler after srpt device initialization
is complete.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26872 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
