Subject: CVE-2024-50062: RDMA/rtrs-srv: Avoid null pointer deref during path establishment

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rtrs-srv: Avoid null pointer deref during path establishment

For RTRS path establishment, RTRS client initiates and completes con_num
of connections. After establishing all its connections, the information
is exchanged between the client and server through the info_req message.
During this exchange, it is essential that all connections have been
established, and the state of the RTRS srv path is CONNECTED.

So add these sanity checks, to make sure we detect and abort process in
error scenarios to avoid null pointer deref.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50062 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
