Subject: CVE-2024-35952: drm/ast: Fix soft lockup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/ast: Fix soft lockup

There is a while-loop in ast_dp_set_on_off() that could lead to
infinite-loop. This is because the register, VGACRI-Dx, checked in
this API is a scratch register actually controlled by a MCU, named
DPMCU, in BMC.

These scratch registers are protected by scu-lock. If suc-lock is not
off, DPMCU can not update these registers and then host will have soft
lockup due to never updated status.

DPMCU is used to control DP and relative registers to handshake with
host's VGA driver. Even the most time-consuming task, DP's link
training, is less than 100ms. 200ms should be enough.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35952 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
