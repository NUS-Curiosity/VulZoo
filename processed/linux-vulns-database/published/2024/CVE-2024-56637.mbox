Subject: CVE-2024-56637: netfilter: ipset: Hold module reference while requesting a module

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: Hold module reference while requesting a module

User space may unload ip_set.ko while it is itself requesting a set type
backend module, leading to a kernel crash. The race condition may be
provoked by inserting an mdelay() right after the nfnl_unlock() call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56637 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
