Subject: CVE-2024-50042: ice: Fix increasing MSI-X on VF

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Fix increasing MSI-X on VF

Increasing MSI-X value on a VF leads to invalid memory operations. This
is caused by not reallocating some arrays.

Reproducer:
  modprobe ice
  echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/$PF_PCI/sriov_drivers_autoprobe
  echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/$PF_PCI/sriov_numvfs
  echo 17 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/$VF0_PCI/sriov_vf_msix_count

Default MSI-X is 16, so 17 and above triggers this issue.

KASAN reports:

   (...)

To fix it, use ice_vsi_rebuild() instead of ice_vf_reconfig_vsi(). This
causes the required arrays to be reallocated taking the new queue count
into account (ice_vsi_realloc_stat_arrays()). Set req_txq and req_rxq
before ice_vsi_rebuild(), so that realloc uses the newly set queue
count.

Additionally, ice_vsi_rebuild() does not remove VSI filters
(ice_fltr_remove_all()), so ice_vf_init_host_cfg() is no longer
necessary.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50042 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
