Subject: CVE-2024-52319: mm: use aligned address in clear_gigantic_page()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: use aligned address in clear_gigantic_page()

In current kernel, hugetlb_no_page() calls folio_zero_user() with the
fault address.  Where the fault address may be not aligned with the huge
page size.  Then, folio_zero_user() may call clear_gigantic_page() with
the address, while clear_gigantic_page() requires the address to be huge
page size aligned.  So, this may cause memory corruption or information
leak, addtional, use more obvious naming 'addr_hint' instead of 'addr' for
clear_gigantic_page().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-52319 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
