Subject: CVE-2024-42272: sched: act_ct: take care of padding in struct zones_ht_key

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched: act_ct: take care of padding in struct zones_ht_key

Blamed commit increased lookup key size from 2 bytes to 16 bytes,
because zones_ht_key got a struct net pointer.

Make sure rhashtable_lookup() is not using the padding bytes
which are not initialized.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
