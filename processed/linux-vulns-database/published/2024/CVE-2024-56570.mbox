Subject: CVE-2024-56570: ovl: Filter invalid inodes with missing lookup function

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ovl: Filter invalid inodes with missing lookup function

Add a check to the ovl_dentry_weird() function to prevent the
processing of directory inodes that lack the lookup function.
This is important because such inodes can cause errors in overlayfs
when passed to the lowerstack.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56570 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
