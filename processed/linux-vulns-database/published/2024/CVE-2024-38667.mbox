Subject: CVE-2024-38667: riscv: prevent pt_regs corruption for secondary idle threads

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: prevent pt_regs corruption for secondary idle threads

Top of the kernel thread stack should be reserved for pt_regs. However
this is not the case for the idle threads of the secondary boot harts.
Their stacks overlap with their pt_regs, so both may get corrupted.

Similar issue has been fixed for the primary hart, see c7cdd96eca28
("riscv: prevent stack corruption by reserving task_pt_regs(p) early").
However that fix was not propagated to the secondary harts. The problem
has been noticed in some CPU hotplug tests with V enabled. The function
smp_callin stored several registers on stack, corrupting top of pt_regs
structure including status field. As a result, kernel attempted to save
or restore inexistent V context.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38667 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
