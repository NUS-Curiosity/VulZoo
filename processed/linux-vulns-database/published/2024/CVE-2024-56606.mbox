Subject: CVE-2024-56606: af_packet: avoid erroring out after sock_init_data() in packet_create()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_packet: avoid erroring out after sock_init_data() in packet_create()

After sock_init_data() the allocated sk object is attached to the provided
sock object. On error, packet_create() frees the sk object leaving the
dangling pointer in the sock object on return. Some other code may try
to use this pointer and cause use-after-free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56606 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
