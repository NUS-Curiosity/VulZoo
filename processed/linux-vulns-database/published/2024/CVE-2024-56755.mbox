Subject: CVE-2024-56755: netfs/fscache: Add a memory barrier for FSCACHE_VOLUME_CREATING

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs/fscache: Add a memory barrier for FSCACHE_VOLUME_CREATING

In fscache_create_volume(), there is a missing memory barrier between the
bit-clearing operation and the wake-up operation. This may cause a
situation where, after a wake-up, the bit-clearing operation hasn't been
detected yet, leading to an indefinite wait. The triggering process is as
follows:

  [cookie1]                [cookie2]                  [volume_work]
fscache_perform_lookup
  fscache_create_volume
                        fscache_perform_lookup
                          fscache_create_volume
			                        fscache_create_volume_work
                                                  cachefiles_acquire_volume
                                                  clear_and_wake_up_bit
    test_and_set_bit
                            test_and_set_bit
                              goto maybe_wait
      goto no_wait

In the above process, cookie1 and cookie2 has the same volume. When cookie1
enters the -no_wait- process, it will clear the bit and wake up the waiting
process. If a barrier is missing, it may cause cookie2 to remain in the
-wait- process indefinitely.

In commit 3288666c7256 ("fscache: Use clear_and_wake_up_bit() in
fscache_create_volume_work()"), barriers were added to similar operations
in fscache_create_volume_work(), but fscache_create_volume() was missed.

By combining the clear and wake operations into clear_and_wake_up_bit() to
fix this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56755 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
