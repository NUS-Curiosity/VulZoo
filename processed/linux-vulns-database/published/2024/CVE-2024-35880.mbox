Subject: CVE-2024-35880: io_uring/kbuf: hold io_buffer_list reference over mmap

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/kbuf: hold io_buffer_list reference over mmap

If we look up the kbuf, ensure that it doesn't get unregistered until
after we're done with it. Since we're inside mmap, we cannot safely use
the io_uring lock. Rely on the fact that we can lookup the buffer list
under RCU now and grab a reference to it, preventing it from being
unregistered until we're done with it. The lookup returns the
io_buffer_list directly with it referenced.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35880 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
