Subject: CVE-2024-50285: ksmbd: check outstanding simultaneous SMB operations

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: check outstanding simultaneous SMB operations

If Client send simultaneous SMB operations to ksmbd, It exhausts too much
memory through the "ksmbd_work_cache‚Äù. It will cause OOM issue.
ksmbd has a credit mechanism but it can't handle this problem. This patch
add the check if it exceeds max credits to prevent this problem by assuming
that one smb request consumes at least one credit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50285 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
