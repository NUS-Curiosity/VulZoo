Subject: CVE-2024-50216: xfs: fix finding a last resort AG in xfs_filestream_pick_ag

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: fix finding a last resort AG in xfs_filestream_pick_ag

When the main loop in xfs_filestream_pick_ag fails to find a suitable
AG it tries to just pick the online AG.  But the loop for that uses
args->pag as loop iterator while the later code expects pag to be
set.  Fix this by reusing the max_pag case for this last resort, and
also add a check for impossible case of no AG just to make sure that
the uninitialized pag doesn't even escape in theory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50216 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/77ddc732416b017180893cbb2356e9f0a414c575
