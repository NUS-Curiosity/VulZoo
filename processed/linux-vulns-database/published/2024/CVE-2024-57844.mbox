Subject: CVE-2024-57844: drm/xe: Fix fault on fd close after unbind

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Fix fault on fd close after unbind

If userspace holds an fd open, unbinds the device and then closes it,
the driver shouldn't try to access the hardware. Protect it by using
drm_dev_enter()/drm_dev_exit(). This fixes the following page fault:

<6> [IGT] xe_wedged: exiting, ret=98
<1> BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffc901bc5e508c
<1> #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
<1> #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/924d43bd10a1f6723ac5181a6e6cc2196ba98cdd
