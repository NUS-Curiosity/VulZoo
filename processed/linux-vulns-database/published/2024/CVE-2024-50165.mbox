Subject: CVE-2024-50165: bpf: Preserve param->string when parsing mount options

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Preserve param->string when parsing mount options

In bpf_parse_param(), keep the value of param->string intact so it can
be freed later. Otherwise, the kmalloc area pointed to by param->string
will be leaked as shown below:

unreferenced object 0xffff888118c46d20 (size 8):

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5d7a0a426540319327309035509cb768a2f5c2c4
