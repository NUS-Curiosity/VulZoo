Subject: CVE-2024-50158: RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix out of bound check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix out of bound check

Driver exports pacing stats only on GenP5 and P7 adapters. But while
parsing the pacing stats, driver has a check for "rdev->dbr_pacing".  This
caused a trace when KASAN is enabled.

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in bnxt_re_get_hw_stats+0x2b6a/0x2e00 [bnxt_re]
Write of size 8 at addr ffff8885942a6340 by task modprobe/4809

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50158 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
