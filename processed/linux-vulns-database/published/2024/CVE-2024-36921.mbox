Subject: CVE-2024-36921: wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: guard against invalid STA ID on removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: guard against invalid STA ID on removal

result in out-of-bounds array accesses. This prevents issues should the
driver get into a bad state during error handling.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
