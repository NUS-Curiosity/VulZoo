Subject: CVE-2024-50174: drm/panthor: Fix race when converting group handle to group object

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panthor: Fix race when converting group handle to group object

XArray provides it's own internal lock which protects the internal array
when entries are being simultaneously added and removed. However there
is still a race between retrieving the pointer from the XArray and
incrementing the reference count.

To avoid this race simply hold the internal XArray lock when
incrementing the reference count, this ensures there cannot be a racing
call to xa_erase().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50174 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
