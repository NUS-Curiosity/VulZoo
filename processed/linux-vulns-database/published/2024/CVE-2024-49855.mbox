Subject: CVE-2024-49855: nbd: fix race between timeout and normal completion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: fix race between timeout and normal completion

If request timetout is handled by nbd_requeue_cmd(), normal completion
has to be stopped for avoiding to complete this requeued request, other
use-after-free can be triggered.

Fix the race by clearing NBD_CMD_INFLIGHT in nbd_requeue_cmd(), meantime
make sure that cmd->lock is grabbed for clearing the flag and the
requeue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49855 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
