Subject: CVE-2024-49887: f2fs: fix to don't panic system for no free segment fault injection

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to don't panic system for no free segment fault injection

f2fs: fix to don't panic system for no free segment fault injection

syzbot reports a f2fs bug as below:

F2FS-fs (loop0): inject no free segment in get_new_segment of __allocate_new_segment+0x1ce/0x940 fs/f2fs/segment.c:3167
F2FS-fs (loop0): Stopped filesystem due to reason: 7

The root cause is when we inject no free segment fault into f2fs,
we should not panic system, fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49887 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
