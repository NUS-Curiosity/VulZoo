Subject: CVE-2024-42301: dev/parport: fix the array out-of-bounds risk

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dev/parport: fix the array out-of-bounds risk

Fixed array out-of-bounds issues caused by sprintf
by replacing it with snprintf for safer data copying,
ensuring the destination buffer is not overflowed.

Below is the stack trace I encountered during the actual issue:

[ 66.575408s] [pid:5118,cpu4,QThread,4]Kernel panic - not syncing: stack-protector:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
