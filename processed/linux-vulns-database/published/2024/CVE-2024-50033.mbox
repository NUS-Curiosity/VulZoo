Subject: CVE-2024-50033: slip: make slhc_remember() more robust against malicious packets

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

slip: make slhc_remember() more robust against malicious packets

syzbot found that slhc_remember() was missing checks against
malicious packets [1].

slhc_remember() only checked the size of the packet was at least 20,
which is not good enough.

We need to make sure the packet includes the IPv4 and TCP header
that are supposed to be carried.

Add iph and th pointers to make the code more readable.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
