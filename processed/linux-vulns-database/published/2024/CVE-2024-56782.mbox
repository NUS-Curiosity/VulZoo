Subject: CVE-2024-56782: ACPI: x86: Add adev NULL check to acpi_quirk_skip_serdev_enumeration()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ACPI: x86: Add adev NULL check to acpi_quirk_skip_serdev_enumeration()

acpi_dev_hid_match() does not check for adev == NULL, dereferencing
it unconditional.

Add a check for adev being NULL before calling acpi_dev_hid_match().

At the moment acpi_quirk_skip_serdev_enumeration() is never called with
a controller_parent without an ACPI companion, but better safe than sorry.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56782 to this issue.

	Fixed in 6.12.5 with commit e173bce05f7032a8b4964cfef82a4b7668f5f3af

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e173bce05f7032a8b4964cfef82a4b7668f5f3af
