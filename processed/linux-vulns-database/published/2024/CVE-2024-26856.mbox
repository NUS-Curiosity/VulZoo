Subject: CVE-2024-26856: net: sparx5: Fix use after free inside sparx5_del_mact_entry

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sparx5: Fix use after free inside sparx5_del_mact_entry

Based on the static analyzis of the code it looks like when an entry
from the MAC table was removed, the entry was still used after being
freed. More precise the vid of the mac_entry was used after calling
devm_kfree on the mac_entry.
The fix consists in first using the vid of the mac_entry to delete the
entry from the HW and after that to free it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26856 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
