Subject: CVE-2024-46677: gtp: fix a potential NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gtp: fix a potential NULL pointer dereference

When sockfd_lookup() fails, gtp_encap_enable_socket() returns a
NULL pointer, but its callers only check for error pointers thus miss
the NULL pointer case.

Fix it by returning an error pointer with the error code carried from
sockfd_lookup().

(I found this bug during code inspection.)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46677 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
