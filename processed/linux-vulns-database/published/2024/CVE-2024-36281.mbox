Subject: CVE-2024-36281: net/mlx5: Use mlx5_ipsec_rx_status_destroy to correctly delete status rules

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Use mlx5_ipsec_rx_status_destroy to correctly delete status rules

rx_create no longer allocates a modify_hdr instance that needs to be
cleaned up. The mlx5_modify_header_dealloc call will lead to a NULL pointer
dereference. A leak in the rules also previously occurred since there are
now two rules populated related to status.

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
  #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
