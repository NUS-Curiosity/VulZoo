Subject: CVE-2024-26668: netfilter: nft_limit: reject configurations that cause integer overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_limit: reject configurations that cause integer overflow

Reject bogus configs where internal token counter wraps around.
This only occurs with very very large requests, such as 17gbyte/s.

Its better to reject this rather than having incorrect ratelimit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26668 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
