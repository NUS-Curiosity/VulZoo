Subject: CVE-2024-38583: nilfs2: fix use-after-free of timer for log writer thread

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix use-after-free of timer for log writer thread

Patch series "nilfs2: fix log writer related issues".

This bug fix series covers three nilfs2 log writer-related issues,
including a timer use-after-free issue and potential deadlock issue on
unmount, and a potential freeze issue in event synchronization found
during their analysis.  Details are described in each commit log.


This patch (of 3):

A use-after-free issue has been reported regarding the timer sc_timer on
the nilfs_sc_info structure.

The problem is that even though it is used to wake up a sleeping log
writer thread, sc_timer is not shut down until the nilfs_sc_info structure
is about to be freed, and is used regardless of the thread's lifetime.

Fix this issue by limiting the use of sc_timer only while the log writer
thread is alive.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38583 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
