Subject: CVE-2024-49923: drm/amd/display: Pass non-null to dcn20_validate_apply_pipe_split_flags

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Pass non-null to dcn20_validate_apply_pipe_split_flags

[WHAT & HOW]
"dcn20_validate_apply_pipe_split_flags" dereferences merge, and thus it
cannot be a null pointer. Let's pass a valid pointer to avoid null
dereference.

This fixes 2 FORWARD_NULL issues reported by Coverity.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49923 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
