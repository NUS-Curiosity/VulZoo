Subject: CVE-2024-50222: iov_iter: fix copy_page_from_iter_atomic() if KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iov_iter: fix copy_page_from_iter_atomic() if KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP

generic/077 on x86_32 CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP=y with highmem,
on huge=always tmpfs, issues a warning and then hangs (interruptibly):

WARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 3517 at mm/highmem.c:622 kunmap_local_indexed+0x62/0xc9
CPU: 5 UID: 0 PID: 3517 Comm: cp Not tainted 6.12.0-rc4 #2
...
copy_page_from_iter_atomic+0xa6/0x5ec
generic_perform_write+0xf6/0x1b4
shmem_file_write_iter+0x54/0x67

Fix copy_page_from_iter_atomic() by limiting it in that case
(include/linux/skbuff.h skb_frag_must_loop() does similar).

But going forward, perhaps CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL_FORCE_MAP is too
surprising, has outlived its usefulness, and should just be removed?

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50222 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
