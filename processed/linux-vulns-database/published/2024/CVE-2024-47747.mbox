Subject: CVE-2024-47747: net: seeq: Fix use after free vulnerability in ether3 Driver Due to Race Condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: seeq: Fix use after free vulnerability in ether3 Driver Due to Race Condition

In the ether3_probe function, a timer is initialized with a callback
function ether3_ledoff, bound to &prev(dev)->timer. Once the timer is
started, there is a risk of a race condition if the module or device
is removed, triggering the ether3_remove function to perform cleanup.
The sequence of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

CPU0                                    CPU1

                      |  ether3_ledoff
ether3_remove         |
  free_netdev(dev);   |
  put_devic           |
  kfree(dev);         |
 |  ether3_outw(priv(dev)->regs.config2 |= CFG2_CTRLO, REG_CONFIG2);
                      | // use dev

Fix it by ensuring that the timer is canceled before proceeding with
the cleanup in ether3_remove.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47747 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
