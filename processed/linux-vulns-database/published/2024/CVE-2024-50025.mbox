Subject: CVE-2024-50025: scsi: fnic: Move flush_work initialization out of if block

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: fnic: Move flush_work initialization out of if block

After commit 379a58caa199 ("scsi: fnic: Move fnic_fnic_flush_tx() to a
work queue"), it can happen that a work item is sent to an uninitialized
work queue.  This may has the effect that the item being queued is never
actually queued, and any further actions depending on it will not
proceed.

The following warning is observed while the fnic driver is loaded:

kernel: WARNING: CPU: 11 PID: 0 at ../kernel/workqueue.c:1524 __queue_work+0x373/0x410

kernel:  __common_interrupt+0x3b/0xb0
kernel:  common_interrupt+0x58/0xa0
kernel:  </IRQ>

It has been observed that this may break the rediscovery of Fibre
Channel devices after a temporary fabric failure.

This patch fixes it by moving the work queue initialization out of
an if block in fnic_probe().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50025 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6b7836b80061bf1accc5d78b12bc086aed252388
