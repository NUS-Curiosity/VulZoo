Subject: CVE-2024-56580: media: qcom: camss: fix error path on configuration of power domains

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: qcom: camss: fix error path on configuration of power domains

There is a chance to meet runtime issues during configuration of CAMSS
power domains, because on the error path dev_pm_domain_detach() is
unexpectedly called with NULL or error pointer.

One of the simplest ways to reproduce the problem is to probe CAMSS
driver before registration of CAMSS power domains, for instance if
a platform CAMCC driver is simply not built.

Warning backtrace example:

    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000001a2

    <snip>

    pc : dev_pm_domain_detach+0x8/0x48
    lr : camss_probe+0x374/0x9c0

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c98586d8d01c9e860e7acc3807c2afeb1dc14e8a
