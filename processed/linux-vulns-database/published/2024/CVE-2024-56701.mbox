Subject: CVE-2024-56701: powerpc/pseries: Fix dtl_access_lock to be a rw_semaphore

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pseries: Fix dtl_access_lock to be a rw_semaphore

The dtl_access_lock needs to be a rw_sempahore, a sleeping lock, because
the code calls kmalloc() while holding it, which can sleep:

  # echo 1 > /proc/powerpc/vcpudispatch_stats
  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at include/linux/sched/mm.h:337
  in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 199, name: sh

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
