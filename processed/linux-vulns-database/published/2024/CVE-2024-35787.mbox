Subject: CVE-2024-35787: md/md-bitmap: fix incorrect usage for sb_index

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/md-bitmap: fix incorrect usage for sb_index

Commit d7038f951828 ("md-bitmap: don't use ->index for pages backing the
bitmap file") removed page->index from bitmap code, but left wrong code
logic for clustered-md. current code never set slot offset for cluster
nodes, will sometimes cause crash in clustered env.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
