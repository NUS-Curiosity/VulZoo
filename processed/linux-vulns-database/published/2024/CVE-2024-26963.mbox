Subject: CVE-2024-26963: usb: dwc3-am62: fix module unload/reload behavior

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3-am62: fix module unload/reload behavior

As runtime PM is enabled, the module can be runtime
suspended when .remove() is called.

Do a pm_runtime_get_sync() to make sure module is active
before doing any register operations.

Doing a pm_runtime_put_sync() should disable the refclk
so no need to disable it again.

Fixes the below warning at module removel.

[   39.705310] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[   39.710004] clk:162:3 already disabled
[   39.713941] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 921 at drivers/clk/clk.c:1090 clk_core_disable+0xb0/0xb8

We called of_platform_populate() in .probe() so call the
cleanup function of_platform_depopulate() in .remove().
Get rid of the now unnnecessary dwc3_ti_remove_core().
Without this, module re-load doesn't work properly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26963 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
