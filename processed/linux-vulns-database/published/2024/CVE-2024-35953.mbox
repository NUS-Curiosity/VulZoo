Subject: CVE-2024-35953: accel/ivpu: Fix deadlock in context_xa

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/ivpu: Fix deadlock in context_xa

ivpu_device->context_xa is locked both in kernel thread and IRQ context.
It requires XA_FLAGS_LOCK_IRQ flag to be passed during initialization
otherwise the lock could be acquired from a thread and interrupted by
an IRQ that locks it for the second time causing the deadlock.

This deadlock was reported by lockdep and observed in internal tests.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35953 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
