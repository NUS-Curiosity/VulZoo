Subject: CVE-2024-53061: media: s5p-jpeg: prevent buffer overflows

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: s5p-jpeg: prevent buffer overflows

The current logic allows word to be less than 2. If this happens,
there will be buffer overflows, as reported by smatch. Add extra
checks to prevent it.

While here, remove an unused word = 0 assignment.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53061 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
