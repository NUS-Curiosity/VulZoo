Subject: CVE-2024-26866: spi: lpspi: Avoid potential use-after-free in probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: lpspi: Avoid potential use-after-free in probe()

fsl_lpspi_probe() is allocating/disposing memory manually with
spi_alloc_host()/spi_alloc_target(), but uses
devm_spi_register_controller(). In case of error after the latter call the
memory will be explicitly freed in the probe function by
spi_controller_put() call, but used afterwards by "devm" management outside
probe() (spi_unregister_controller() <- devm_spi_unregister() below).

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000070

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
