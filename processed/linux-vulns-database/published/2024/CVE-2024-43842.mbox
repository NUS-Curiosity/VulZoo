Subject: CVE-2024-43842: wifi: rtw89: Fix array index mistake in rtw89_sta_info_get_iter()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw89: Fix array index mistake in rtw89_sta_info_get_iter()

In rtw89_sta_info_get_iter() 'status->he_gi' is compared to array size.
But then 'rate->he_gi' is used as array index instead of 'status->he_gi'.
This can lead to go beyond array boundaries in case of 'rate->he_gi' is
not equal to 'status->he_gi' and is bigger than array size. Looks like
"copy-paste" mistake.

Fix this mistake by replacing 'rate->he_gi' with 'status->he_gi'.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43842 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
