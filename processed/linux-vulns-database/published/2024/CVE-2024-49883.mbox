Subject: CVE-2024-49883: ext4: aovid use-after-free in ext4_ext_insert_extent()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: aovid use-after-free in ext4_ext_insert_extent()

As Ojaswin mentioned in Link, in ext4_ext_insert_extent(), if the path is
reallocated in ext4_ext_create_new_leaf(), we'll use the stale path and
cause UAF. Below is a sample trace with dummy values:

ext4_ext_insert_extent
  path = *ppath = 2000
  ext4_ext_create_new_leaf(ppath)
    ext4_find_extent(ppath)
      path = *ppath = 2000
      if (depth > path[0].p_maxdepth)
            kfree(path = 2000);
            *ppath = path = NULL;
      path = kcalloc() = 3000
      *ppath = 3000;
      return path;
  /* here path is still 2000, UAF! */
  eh = path[depth].p_hdr

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
