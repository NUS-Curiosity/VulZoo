Subject: CVE-2024-42295: nilfs2: handle inconsistent state in nilfs_btnode_create_block()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: handle inconsistent state in nilfs_btnode_create_block()

Syzbot reported that a buffer state inconsistency was detected in
nilfs_btnode_create_block(), triggering a kernel bug.

It is not appropriate to treat this inconsistency as a bug; it can occur
if the argument block address (the buffer index of the newly created
block) is a virtual block number and has been reallocated due to
corruption of the bitmap used to manage its allocation state.

So, modify nilfs_btnode_create_block() and its callers to treat it as a
possible filesystem error, rather than triggering a kernel bug.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42295 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
