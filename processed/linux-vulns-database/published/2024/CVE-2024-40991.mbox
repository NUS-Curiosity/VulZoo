Subject: CVE-2024-40991: dmaengine: ti: k3-udma-glue: Fix of_k3_udma_glue_parse_chn_by_id()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: ti: k3-udma-glue: Fix of_k3_udma_glue_parse_chn_by_id()

The of_k3_udma_glue_parse_chn_by_id() helper function erroneously
invokes "of_node_put()" on the "udmax_np" device-node passed to it,
without having incremented its reference count at any point. Fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40991 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
