Subject: CVE-2024-27045: drm/amd/display: Fix a potential buffer overflow in 'dp_dsc_clock_en_read()'

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix a potential buffer overflow in 'dp_dsc_clock_en_read()'

Tell snprintf() to store at most 10 bytes in the output buffer
instead of 30.

Fixes the below:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm_debugfs.c:1508 dp_dsc_clock_en_read() error: snprintf() is printing too much 30 vs 10

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27045 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
