Subject: CVE-2024-26839: IB/hfi1: Fix a memleak in init_credit_return

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

IB/hfi1: Fix a memleak in init_credit_return

When dma_alloc_coherent fails to allocate dd->cr_base[i].va,
init_credit_return should deallocate dd->cr_base and
dd->cr_base[i] that allocated before. Or those resources
would be never freed and a memleak is triggered.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26839 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
