Subject: CVE-2024-49999: afs: Fix the setting of the server responding flag

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

afs: Fix the setting of the server responding flag

In afs_wait_for_operation(), we set transcribe the call responded flag to
the server record that we used after doing the fileserver iteration loop -
but it's possible to exit the loop having had a response from the server
that we've discarded (e.g. it returned an abort or we started receiving
data, but the call didn't complete).

This means that op->server might be NULL, but we don't check that before
attempting to set the server flag.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49999 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
