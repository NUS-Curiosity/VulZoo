Subject: CVE-2024-35916: dma-buf: Fix NULL pointer dereference in sanitycheck()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dma-buf: Fix NULL pointer dereference in sanitycheck()

If due to a memory allocation failure mock_chain() returns NULL, it is
passed to dma_fence_enable_sw_signaling() resulting in NULL pointer
dereference there.

Call dma_fence_enable_sw_signaling() only if mock_chain() succeeds.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35916 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
