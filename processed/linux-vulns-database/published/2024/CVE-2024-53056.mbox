Subject: CVE-2024-53056: drm/mediatek: Fix potential NULL dereference in mtk_crtc_destroy()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Fix potential NULL dereference in mtk_crtc_destroy()

In mtk_crtc_create(), if the call to mbox_request_channel() fails then we
set the "mtk_crtc->cmdq_client.chan" pointer to NULL.  In that situation,
we do not call cmdq_pkt_create().

During the cleanup, we need to check if the "mtk_crtc->cmdq_client.chan"
is NULL first before calling cmdq_pkt_destroy().  Calling
cmdq_pkt_destroy() is unnecessary if we didn't call cmdq_pkt_create() and
it will result in a NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53056 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c60583a87cb4a85b69d1f448f0be5eb6ec62cbb2
