Subject: CVE-2024-27043: media: edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-free

In dvb_register_device, *pdvbdev is set equal to dvbdev, which is freed
in several error-handling paths. However, *pdvbdev is not set to NULL
after dvbdev's deallocation, causing use-after-frees in many places,
for example, in the following call chain:

budget_register
  |-> dvb_dmxdev_init
        |-> dvb_register_device
  |-> dvb_dmxdev_release
        |-> dvb_unregister_device
              |-> dvb_remove_device
                    |-> dvb_device_put
                          |-> kref_put

When calling dvb_unregister_device, dmxdev->dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev in
dvb_register_device) could point to memory that had been freed in
dvb_register_device. Thereafter, this pointer is transferred to
kref_put and triggering a use-after-free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27043 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
