Subject: CVE-2024-41032: mm: vmalloc: check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: vmalloc: check if a hash-index is in cpu_possible_mask

The problem is that there are systems where cpu_possible_mask has gaps
between set CPUs, for example SPARC.  In this scenario addr_to_vb_xa()
hash function can return an index which accesses to not-possible and not
setup CPU area using per_cpu() macro.  This results in an oops on SPARC.

A per-cpu vmap_block_queue is also used as hash table, incorrectly
assuming the cpu_possible_mask has no gaps.  Fix it by adjusting an index
to a next possible CPU.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41032 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
