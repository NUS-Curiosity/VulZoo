Subject: CVE-2024-50227: thunderbolt: Fix KASAN reported stack out-of-bounds read in tb_retimer_scan()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thunderbolt: Fix KASAN reported stack out-of-bounds read in tb_retimer_scan()

KASAN reported following issue:

 BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in tb_retimer_scan+0xffe/0x1550 [thunderbolt]
 Read of size 4 at addr ffff88810111fc1c by task kworker/u56:0/11

This happens because the loop variable still gets incremented by one so
max becomes 3 instead of 2, and this makes the second loop read past the
the array declared on the stack.

Fix this by assigning to max directly in the loop body.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50227 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/08b2771e9270fbe1ed4fbbe93abe05ac7fe9861d
