Subject: CVE-2024-57793: virt: tdx-guest: Just leak decrypted memory on unrecoverable errors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virt: tdx-guest: Just leak decrypted memory on unrecoverable errors

In CoCo VMs it is possible for the untrusted host to cause
set_memory_decrypted() to fail such that an error is returned
and the resulting memory is shared. Callers need to take care
to handle these errors to avoid returning decrypted (shared)
memory to the page allocator, which could lead to functional
or security issues.

Leak the decrypted memory when set_memory_decrypted() fails,
and don't need to print an error since set_memory_decrypted()
will call WARN_ONCE().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57793 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1429ae7b7d4759a1e362456b8911c701bae655b4
