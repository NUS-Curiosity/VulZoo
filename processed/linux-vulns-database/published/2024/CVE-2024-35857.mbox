Subject: CVE-2024-35857: icmp: prevent possible NULL dereferences from icmp_build_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

icmp: prevent possible NULL dereferences from icmp_build_probe()

First problem is a double call to __in_dev_get_rcu(), because
the second one could return NULL.

if (__in_dev_get_rcu(dev) && __in_dev_get_rcu(dev)->ifa_list)

Second problem is a read from dev->ip6_ptr with no NULL check:

if (!list_empty(&rcu_dereference(dev->ip6_ptr)->addr_list))

Use the correct RCU API to fix these.

v2: add missing include <net/addrconf.h>

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35857 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
