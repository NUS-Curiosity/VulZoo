Subject: CVE-2024-57998: OPP: add index check to assert to avoid buffer overflow in _read_freq()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

OPP: add index check to assert to avoid buffer overflow in _read_freq()

Pass the freq index to the assert function to make sure
we do not read a freq out of the opp->rates[] table when called
from the indexed variants:
dev_pm_opp_find_freq_exact_indexed() or
dev_pm_opp_find_freq_ceil/floor_indexed().

Add a secondary parameter to the assert function, unused
for assert_single_clk() then add assert_clk_index() which
will check for the clock index when called from the _indexed()
find functions.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57998 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
