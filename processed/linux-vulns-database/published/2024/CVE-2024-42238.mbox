Subject: CVE-2024-42238: firmware: cs_dsp: Return error if block header overflows file

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Return error if block header overflows file

Return an error from cs_dsp_power_up() if a block header is longer
than the amount of data left in the file.

The previous code in cs_dsp_load() and cs_dsp_load_coeff() would loop
while there was enough data left in the file for a valid region. This
protected against overrunning the end of the file data, but it didn't
abort the file processing with an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42238 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
