Subject: CVE-2024-49973: r8169: add tally counter fields added with RTL8125

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

r8169: add tally counter fields added with RTL8125

RTL8125 added fields to the tally counter, what may result in the chip
dma'ing these new fields to unallocated memory. Therefore make sure
that the allocated memory area is big enough to hold all of the
tally counter values, even if we use only parts of it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49973 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
