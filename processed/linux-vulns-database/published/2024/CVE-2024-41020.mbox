Subject: CVE-2024-41020: filelock: Fix fcntl/close race recovery compat path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

filelock: Fix fcntl/close race recovery compat path

When I wrote commit 3cad1bc01041 ("filelock: Remove locks reliably when
fcntl/close race is detected"), I missed that there are two copies of the
code I was patching: The normal version, and the version for 64-bit offsets
on 32-bit kernels.
Thanks to Greg KH for stumbling over this while doing the stable
backport...

Apply exactly the same fix to the compat path for 32-bit kernels.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41020 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
