Subject: CVE-2024-43879: wifi: cfg80211: handle 2x996 RU allocation in cfg80211_calculate_bitrate_he()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: handle 2x996 RU allocation in cfg80211_calculate_bitrate_he()

Currently NL80211_RATE_INFO_HE_RU_ALLOC_2x996 is not handled in
cfg80211_calculate_bitrate_he(), leading to below warning:

kernel: invalid HE MCS: bw:6, ru:6
kernel: WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2312 at net/wireless/util.c:1501 cfg80211_calculate_bitrate_he+0x22b/0x270 [cfg80211]

Fix it by handling 2x996 RU allocation in the same way as 160 MHz bandwidth.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43879 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
