Subject: CVE-2024-46738: VMCI: Fix use-after-free when removing resource in vmci_resource_remove()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

VMCI: Fix use-after-free when removing resource in vmci_resource_remove()

When removing a resource from vmci_resource_table in
vmci_resource_remove(), the search is performed using the resource
handle by comparing context and resource fields.

It is possible though to create two resources with different types
but same handle (same context and resource fields).

When trying to remove one of the resources, vmci_resource_remove()
may not remove the intended one, but the object will still be freed
as in the case of the datagram type in vmci_datagram_destroy_handle().
vmci_resource_table will still hold a pointer to this freed resource
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.

This change ensures the type is also checked when removing
the resource from vmci_resource_table in vmci_resource_remove().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46738 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
