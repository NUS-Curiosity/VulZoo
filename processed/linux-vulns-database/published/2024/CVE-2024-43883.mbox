Subject: CVE-2024-43883: usb: vhci-hcd: Do not drop references before new references are gained

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: vhci-hcd: Do not drop references before new references are gained

At a few places the driver carries stale pointers
to references that can still be used. Make sure that does not happen.
This strictly speaking closes ZDI-CAN-22273, though there may be
similar races in the driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43883 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
