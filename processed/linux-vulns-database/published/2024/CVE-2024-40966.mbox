Subject: CVE-2024-40966: tty: add the option to have a tty reject a new ldisc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: add the option to have a tty reject a new ldisc

... and use it to limit the virtual terminals to just N_TTY.  They are
kind of special, and in particular, the "con_write()" routine violates
the "writes cannot sleep" rule that some ldiscs rely on.

This avoids the

   BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/printk/printk.c:2659

when N_GSM has been attached to a virtual console, and gsmld_write()
calls con_write() while holding a spinlock, and con_write() then tries
to get the console lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40966 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
