Subject: CVE-2024-38549: drm/mediatek: Add 0 size check to mtk_drm_gem_obj

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Add 0 size check to mtk_drm_gem_obj

Add a check to mtk_drm_gem_init if we attempt to allocate a GEM object
of 0 bytes. Currently, no such check exists and the kernel will panic if
a userspace application attempts to allocate a 0x0 GBM buffer.

Tested by attempting to allocate a 0x0 GBM buffer on an MT8188 and
verifying that we now return EINVAL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38549 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
