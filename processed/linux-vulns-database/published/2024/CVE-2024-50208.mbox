Subject: CVE-2024-50208: RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix a bug while setting up Level-2 PBL pages

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix a bug while setting up Level-2 PBL pages

Avoid memory corruption while setting up Level-2 PBL pages for the non MR
resources when num_pages > 256K.

There will be a single PDE page address (contiguous pages in the case of >
PAGE_SIZE), but, current logic assumes multiple pages, leading to invalid
memory access after 256K PBL entries in the PDE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50208 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
