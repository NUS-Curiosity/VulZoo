Subject: CVE-2024-40943: ocfs2: fix races between hole punching and AIO+DIO

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix races between hole punching and AIO+DIO

After commit "ocfs2: return real error code in ocfs2_dio_wr_get_block",
fstests/generic/300 become from always failed to sometimes failed:

========================================================================
[  473.293420 ] run fstests generic/300

=========================================================================

In __blockdev_direct_IO, ocfs2_dio_wr_get_block is called to add unwritten
extents to a list.  extents are also inserted into extent tree in
ocfs2_write_begin_nolock.  Then another thread call fallocate to puch a
hole at one of the unwritten extent.  The extent at cpos was removed by
ocfs2_remove_extent().  At end io worker thread, ocfs2_search_extent_list
found there is no such extent at the cpos.

                                          unlock ip_alloc_sem

In most filesystems, fallocate is not compatible with racing with AIO+DIO,
so fix it by adding to wait for all dio before fallocate/punch_hole like
ext4.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40943 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
