Subject: CVE-2024-50138: bpf: Use raw_spinlock_t in ringbuf

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Use raw_spinlock_t in ringbuf

The function __bpf_ringbuf_reserve is invoked from a tracepoint, which
disables preemption. Using spinlock_t in this context can lead to a
"sleep in atomic" warning in the RT variant. This issue is illustrated
in the example below:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48
in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 556208, name: test_progs
preempt_count: 1, expected: 0
RCU nest depth: 1, expected: 1
INFO: lockdep is turned off.
Preemption disabled at:

Switch the spinlock to raw_spinlock_t to avoid this error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50138 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
