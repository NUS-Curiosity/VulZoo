Subject: CVE-2024-26615: net/smc: fix illegal rmb_desc access in SMC-D connection dump

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: fix illegal rmb_desc access in SMC-D connection dump

A crash was found when dumping SMC-D connections. It can be reproduced
by following steps:

- run nginx/wrk test:
  smc_run nginx
  smc_run wrk -t 16 -c 1000 -d <duration> -H 'Connection: Close' <URL>

- continuously dump SMC-D connections in parallel:
  watch -n 1 'smcss -D'

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000030
 CPU: 2 PID: 7204 Comm: smcss Kdump: loaded Tainted: G	E      6.7.0+ #55

It is possible that the connection is in process of being established
when we dump it. Assumed that the connection has been registered in a
link group by smc_conn_create() but the rmb_desc has not yet been
initialized by smc_buf_create(), thus causing the illegal access to
conn->rmb_desc. So fix it by checking before dump.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26615 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
