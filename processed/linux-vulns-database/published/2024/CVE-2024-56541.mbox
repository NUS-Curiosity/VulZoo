Subject: CVE-2024-56541: wifi: ath12k: fix use-after-free in ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix use-after-free in ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup()

During ath12k module removal, in ath12k_core_deinit(),
ath12k_mac_destroy() un-registers ah->hw from mac80211 and frees
the ah->hw as well as all the ar's in it. After this
ath12k_core_soc_destroy()-> ath12k_dp_free()-> ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup()
tries to access one of the freed ar's from pending skb.

This is because during mac destroy, driver failed to flush few
data packets, which were accessed later in ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup()
and freed, but using ar from the packet led to this use-after-free.

Commit 24de1b7b231c ("wifi: ath12k: fix flush failure in recovery
scenarios") added the change to decrement the pending packets count
in case of recovery which make sense as ah->hw as well all
ar's in it are intact during recovery, but during core deinit there
is no use in decrementing packets count or waking up the empty waitq
as the module is going to be removed also ar's from pending skb's
can't be used and the packets should just be released back.

To fix this, avoid accessing ar from skb->cb when driver is being
unregistered.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
