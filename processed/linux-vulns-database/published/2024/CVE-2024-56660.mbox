Subject: CVE-2024-56660: net/mlx5: DR, prevent potential error pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: DR, prevent potential error pointer dereference

The dr_domain_add_vport_cap() function generally returns NULL on error
but sometimes we want it to return ERR_PTR(-EBUSY) so the caller can
retry.  The problem here is that "ret" can be either -EBUSY or -ENOMEM
and if it's and -ENOMEM then the error pointer is propogated back and
eventually dereferenced in dr_ste_v0_build_src_gvmi_qpn_tag().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56660 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
