Subject: CVE-2024-46710: drm/vmwgfx: Prevent unmapping active read buffers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Prevent unmapping active read buffers

The kms paths keep a persistent map active to read and compare the cursor
buffer. These maps can race with each other in simple scenario where:
a) buffer "a" mapped for update
b) buffer "a" mapped for compare
c) do the compare
d) unmap "a" for compare
e) update the cursor
f) unmap "a" for update
At step "e" the buffer has been unmapped and the read contents is bogus.

Prevent unmapping of active read buffers by simply keeping a count of
how many paths have currently active maps and unmap only when the count
reaches 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46710 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
