Subject: CVE-2024-50272: filemap: Fix bounds checking in filemap_read()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

filemap: Fix bounds checking in filemap_read()

If the caller supplies an iocb->ki_pos value that is close to the
filesystem upper limit, and an iterator with a count that causes us to
overflow that limit, then filemap_read() enters an infinite loop.

This behaviour was discovered when testing xfstests generic/525 with the
"localio" optimisation for loopback NFS mounts.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50272 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
