Subject: CVE-2024-34777: dma-mapping: benchmark: fix node id validation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dma-mapping: benchmark: fix node id validation

While validating node ids in map_benchmark_ioctl(), node_possible() may
be provided with invalid argument outside of [0,MAX_NUMNODES-1] range
leading to:

BUG: KASAN: wild-memory-access in map_benchmark_ioctl (kernel/dma/map_benchmark.c:214)
Read of size 8 at addr 1fffffff8ccb6398 by task dma_map_benchma/971

Compare node ids with sane bounds first. NUMA_NO_NODE is considered a
special valid case meaning that benchmarking kthreads won't be bound to a
cpuset of a given node.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-34777 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
