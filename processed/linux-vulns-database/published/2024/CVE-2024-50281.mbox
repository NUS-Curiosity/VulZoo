Subject: CVE-2024-50281: KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix NULL dereference in AEAD crypto operation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KEYS: trusted: dcp: fix NULL dereference in AEAD crypto operation

When sealing or unsealing a key blob we currently do not wait for
the AEAD cipher operation to finish and simply return after submitting
the request. If there is some load on the system we can exit before
the cipher operation is done and the buffer we read from/write to
is already removed from the stack. This will e.g. result in NULL
pointer dereference errors in the DCP driver during blob creation.

Fix this by waiting for the AEAD cipher operation to finish before
resuming the seal and unseal calls.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50281 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c75e0272289eae18c5379518a9c56ef31d65cc7d
