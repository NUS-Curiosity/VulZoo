Subject: CVE-2024-41065: powerpc/pseries: Whitelist dtl slub object for copying to userspace

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pseries: Whitelist dtl slub object for copying to userspace

Reading the dispatch trace log from /sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/dtl/cpu-*
results in a BUG() when the config CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY is enabled as
shown below.

Commit 6d07d1cd300f ("usercopy: Restrict non-usercopy caches to size 0")
requires that only whitelisted areas in slab/slub objects can be copied to
userspace when usercopy hardening is enabled using CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY.
Dtl contains hypervisor dispatch events which are expected to be read by
privileged users. Hence mark this safe for user access.
Specify useroffset=0 and usersize=DISPATCH_LOG_BYTES to whitelist the
entire object.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41065 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
