Subject: CVE-2024-50224: spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Fix crash when not using GPIO chip select

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Fix crash when not using GPIO chip select

Add check for the return value of spi_get_csgpiod() to avoid passing a NULL
pointer to gpiod_direction_output(), preventing a crash when GPIO chip
select is not used.

Fix below crash:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e79c1f1c9100b4adc91c6512985db2cc961aafaa
