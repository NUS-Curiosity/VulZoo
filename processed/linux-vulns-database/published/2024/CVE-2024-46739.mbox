Subject: CVE-2024-46739: uio_hv_generic: Fix kernel NULL pointer dereference in hv_uio_rescind

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

uio_hv_generic: Fix kernel NULL pointer dereference in hv_uio_rescind

For primary VM Bus channels, primary_channel pointer is always NULL. This
pointer is valid only for the secondary channels. Also, rescind callback
is meant for primary channels only.

Fix NULL pointer dereference by retrieving the device_obj from the parent
for the primary channel.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46739 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
