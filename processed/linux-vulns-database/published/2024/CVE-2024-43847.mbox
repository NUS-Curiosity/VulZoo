Subject: CVE-2024-43847: wifi: ath12k: fix invalid memory access while processing fragmented packets

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix invalid memory access while processing fragmented packets

The monitor ring and the reo reinject ring share the same ring mask index.
When the driver receives an interrupt for the reo reinject ring, the
monitor ring is also processed, leading to invalid memory access. Since
monitor support is not yet enabled in ath12k, the ring mask for the monitor
ring should be removed.

Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.1.1-00209-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43847 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
