Subject: CVE-2024-44938: jfs: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in dbDiscardAG

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in dbDiscardAG

When searching for the next smaller log2 block, BLKSTOL2() returned 0,
causing shift exponent -1 to be negative.

This patch fixes the issue by exiting the loop directly when negative
shift is found.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44938 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
