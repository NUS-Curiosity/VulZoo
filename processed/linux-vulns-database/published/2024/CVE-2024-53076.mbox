Subject: CVE-2024-53076: iio: gts-helper: Fix memory leaks for the error path of iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: gts-helper: Fix memory leaks for the error path of iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table()

If per_time_scales[i] or per_time_gains[i] kcalloc fails in the for loop
of iio_gts_build_avail_scale_table(), the err_free_out will fail to call
kfree() each time when i is reduced to 0, so all the per_time_scales[0]
and per_time_gains[0] will not be freed, which will cause memory leaks.

Fix it by checking if i >= 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53076 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
