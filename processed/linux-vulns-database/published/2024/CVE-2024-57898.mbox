Subject: CVE-2024-57898: wifi: cfg80211: clear link ID from bitmap during link delete after clean up

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: clear link ID from bitmap during link delete after clean up

Currently, during link deletion, the link ID is first removed from the
valid_links bitmap before performing any clean-up operations. However, some
functions require the link ID to remain in the valid_links bitmap. One
such example is cfg80211_cac_event(). The flow is -

nl80211_remove_link()
    cfg80211_remove_link()
        ieee80211_del_intf_link()
            ieee80211_vif_set_links()
                ieee80211_vif_update_links()
                    ieee80211_link_stop()
                        cfg80211_cac_event()

cfg80211_cac_event() requires link ID to be present but it is cleared
already in cfg80211_remove_link(). Ultimately, WARN_ON() is hit.

Therefore, clear the link ID from the bitmap only after completing the link
clean-up.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57898 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.12.9 with commit ae07daf440d3220d0986e676317a5da66e4f9dfd

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-57898
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/mac80211/cfg.c
	net/wireless/util.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ae07daf440d3220d0986e676317a5da66e4f9dfd
