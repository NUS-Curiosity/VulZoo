Subject: CVE-2024-57949: irqchip/gic-v3-its: Don't enable interrupts in its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

irqchip/gic-v3-its: Don't enable interrupts in its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()

The following call-chain leads to enabling interrupts in a nested interrupt
disabled section:

irq_set_vcpu_affinity()
  irq_get_desc_lock()
     raw_spin_lock_irqsave()   <--- Disable interrupts
  its_irq_set_vcpu_affinity()
     guard(raw_spinlock_irq)   <--- Enables interrupts when leaving the guard()
  irq_put_desc_unlock()        <--- Warns because interrupts are enabled

This was broken in commit b97e8a2f7130, which replaced the original
raw_spin_[un]lock() pair with guard(raw_spinlock_irq).

Fix the issue by using guard(raw_spinlock).

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
