Subject: CVE-2024-49856: x86/sgx: Fix deadlock in SGX NUMA node search

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/sgx: Fix deadlock in SGX NUMA node search

When the current node doesn't have an EPC section configured by firmware
and all other EPC sections are used up, CPU can get stuck inside the
while loop that looks for an available EPC page from remote nodes
indefinitely, leading to a soft lockup. Note how nid_of_current will
never be equal to nid in that while loop because nid_of_current is not
set in sgx_numa_mask.

Also worth mentioning is that it's perfectly fine for the firmware not
to setup an EPC section on a node. While setting up an EPC section on
each node can enhance performance, it is not a requirement for
functionality.

Rework the loop to start and end on *a* node that has SGX memory. This
avoids the deadlock looking for the current SGX-lacking node to show up
in the loop when it never will.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49856 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
