Subject: CVE-2024-57899: wifi: mac80211: fix mbss changed flags corruption on 32 bit systems

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix mbss changed flags corruption on 32 bit systems

On 32-bit systems, the size of an unsigned long is 4 bytes,
while a u64 is 8 bytes. Therefore, when using
or_each_set_bit(bit, &bits, sizeof(changed) * BITS_PER_BYTE),
the code is incorrectly searching for a bit in a 32-bit
variable that is expected to be 64 bits in size,
leading to incorrect bit finding.

Solution: Ensure that the size of the bits variable is correctly
adjusted for each architecture.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/86772872f9f5097cd03d0e1c6813238bd38c250b
