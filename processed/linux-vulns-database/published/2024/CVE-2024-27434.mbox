Subject: CVE-2024-27434: wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't set the MFP flag for the GTK

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't set the MFP flag for the GTK

The firmware doesn't need the MFP flag for the GTK, it can even make the
firmware crash. in case the AP is configured with: group cipher TKIP and
MFPC. We would send the GTK with cipher = TKIP and MFP which is of course
not possible.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27434 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
