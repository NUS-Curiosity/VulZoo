Subject: CVE-2024-49863: vhost/scsi: null-ptr-dereference in vhost_scsi_get_req()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vhost/scsi: null-ptr-dereference in vhost_scsi_get_req()

Since commit 3f8ca2e115e5 ("vhost/scsi: Extract common handling code
from control queue handler") a null pointer dereference bug can be
triggered when guest sends an SCSI AN request.

In vhost_scsi_ctl_handle_vq(), `vc.target` is assigned with
`&v_req.tmf.lun[1]` within a switch-case block and is then passed to
vhost_scsi_get_req() which extracts `vc->req` and `tpg`. However, for
a `VIRTIO_SCSI_T_AN_*` request, tpg is not required, so `vc.target` is
set to NULL in this branch. Later, in vhost_scsi_get_req(),
`vc->target` is dereferenced without being checked, leading to a null
pointer dereference bug. This bug can be triggered from guest.

When this bug occurs, the vhost_worker process is killed while holding
`vq->mutex` and the corresponding tpg will remain occupied
indefinitely.

Below is the KASAN report:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
