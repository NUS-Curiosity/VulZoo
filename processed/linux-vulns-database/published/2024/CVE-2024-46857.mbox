Subject: CVE-2024-46857: net/mlx5: Fix bridge mode operations when there are no VFs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix bridge mode operations when there are no VFs

Currently, trying to set the bridge mode attribute when numvfs=0 leads to a
crash:

bridge link set dev eth2 hwmode vepa

(esw->fdb_table.legacy.vepa_fdb is null)

The bridge mode is only relevant when there are multiple functions per
port. Therefore, prevent setting and getting this setting when there are no
VFs.

Note that after this change, there are no settings to change on the PF
interface using `bridge link` when there are no VFs, so the interface no
longer appears in the `bridge link` output.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46857 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
