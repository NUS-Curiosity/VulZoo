Subject: CVE-2024-43862: net: wan: fsl_qmc_hdlc: Convert carrier_lock spinlock to a mutex

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: wan: fsl_qmc_hdlc: Convert carrier_lock spinlock to a mutex

The carrier_lock spinlock protects the carrier detection. While it is
held, framer_get_status() is called which in turn takes a mutex.
This is not correct and can lead to a deadlock.

A run with PROVE_LOCKING enabled detected the issue:
  [ BUG: Invalid wait context ]
  ...
  c204ddbc (&framer->mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: framer_get_status+0x40/0x78
  other info that might help us debug this:
  context-{4:4}
  2 locks held by ifconfig/146:
  #0: c0926a38 (rtnl_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: devinet_ioctl+0x12c/0x664
  #1: c2006a40 (&qmc_hdlc->carrier_lock){....}-{2:2}, at: qmc_hdlc_framer_set_carrier+0x30/0x98

Avoid the spinlock usage and convert carrier_lock to a mutex.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43862 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f223d2b4acb7a45a6e0581cb380e1af1a6dc7ab9
