Subject: CVE-2024-58081: clk: mmp2: call pm_genpd_init() only after genpd.name is set

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: mmp2: call pm_genpd_init() only after genpd.name is set

Setting the genpd's struct device's name with dev_set_name() is
happening within pm_genpd_init(). If it remains NULL, things can blow up
later, such as when crafting the devfs hierarchy for the power domain:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000 when read
  ...
  Call trace:
   strlen from start_creating+0x90/0x138
   start_creating from debugfs_create_dir+0x20/0x178
   debugfs_create_dir from genpd_debug_add.part.0+0x4c/0x144
   genpd_debug_add.part.0 from genpd_debug_init+0x74/0x90
   genpd_debug_init from do_one_initcall+0x5c/0x244
   do_one_initcall from kernel_init_freeable+0x19c/0x1f4
   kernel_init_freeable from kernel_init+0x1c/0x12c
   kernel_init from ret_from_fork+0x14/0x28

Bisecting tracks this crash back to commit 899f44531fe6 ("pmdomain: core:
Add GENPD_FLAG_DEV_NAME_FW flag"), which exchanges use of genpd->name
with dev_name(&genpd->dev) in genpd_debug_add.part().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58081 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/eca01d5911fb34218d10a58d8d9534b758c8fd0a
