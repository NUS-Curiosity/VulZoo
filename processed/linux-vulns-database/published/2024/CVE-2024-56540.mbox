Subject: CVE-2024-56540: accel/ivpu: Prevent recovery invocation during probe and resume

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

accel/ivpu: Prevent recovery invocation during probe and resume

Refactor IPC send and receive functions to allow correct
handling of operations that should not trigger a recovery process.

Expose ivpu_send_receive_internal(), which is now utilized by the D0i3
entry, DCT initialization, and HWS initialization functions.
These functions have been modified to return error codes gracefully,
rather than initiating recovery.

The updated functions are invoked within ivpu_probe() and ivpu_resume(),
ensuring that any errors encountered during these stages result in a proper
teardown or shutdown sequence. The previous approach of triggering recovery
within these functions could lead to a race condition, potentially causing
undefined behavior and kernel crashes due to null pointer dereferences.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56540 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
