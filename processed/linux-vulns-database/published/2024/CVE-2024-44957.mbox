Subject: CVE-2024-44957: xen: privcmd: Switch from mutex to spinlock for irqfds

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen: privcmd: Switch from mutex to spinlock for irqfds

irqfd_wakeup() gets EPOLLHUP, when it is called by
eventfd_release() by way of wake_up_poll(&ctx->wqh, EPOLLHUP), which
gets called under spin_lock_irqsave(). We can't use a mutex here as it
will lead to a deadlock.

Fix it by switching over to a spin lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44957 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
