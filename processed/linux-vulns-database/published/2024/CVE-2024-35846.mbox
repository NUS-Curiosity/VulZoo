Subject: CVE-2024-35846: mm: zswap: fix shrinker NULL crash with cgroup_disable=memory

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: zswap: fix shrinker NULL crash with cgroup_disable=memory

Christian reports a NULL deref in zswap that he bisected down to the zswap
shrinker.  The issue also cropped up in the bug trackers of libguestfs [1]
and the Red Hat bugzilla [2].

The problem is that when memcg is disabled with the boot time flag, the
zswap shrinker might get called with sc->memcg == NULL.  This is okay in
many places, like the lruvec operations.  But it crashes in
memcg_page_state() - which is only used due to the non-node accounting of
cgroup's the zswap memory to begin with.

Nhat spotted that the memcg can be NULL in the memcg-disabled case, and I
was then able to reproduce the crash locally as well.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b0fdabc908a7f81d12382c87ca9e46a9c2e14042
