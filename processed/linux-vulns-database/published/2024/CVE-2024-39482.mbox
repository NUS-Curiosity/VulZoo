Subject: CVE-2024-39482: bcache: fix variable length array abuse in btree_iter

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bcache: fix variable length array abuse in btree_iter

btree_iter is used in two ways: either allocated on the stack with a
fixed size MAX_BSETS, or from a mempool with a dynamic size based on the
specific cache set. Previously, the struct had a fixed-length array of
size MAX_BSETS which was indexed out-of-bounds for the dynamically-sized
iterators, which causes UBSAN to complain.

This patch uses the same approach as in bcachefs's sort_iter and splits
the iterator into a btree_iter with a flexible array member and a
btree_iter_stack which embeds a btree_iter as well as a fixed-length
data array.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39482 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
