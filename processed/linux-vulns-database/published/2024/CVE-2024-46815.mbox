Subject: CVE-2024-46815: drm/amd/display: Check num_valid_sets before accessing reader_wm_sets[]

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check num_valid_sets before accessing reader_wm_sets[]

[WHY & HOW]
num_valid_sets needs to be checked to avoid a negative index when
accessing reader_wm_sets[num_valid_sets - 1].

This fixes an OVERRUN issue reported by Coverity.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
