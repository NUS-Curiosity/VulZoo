Subject: CVE-2024-36898: gpiolib: cdev: fix uninitialised kfifo

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: cdev: fix uninitialised kfifo

If a line is requested with debounce, and that results in debouncing
in software, and the line is subsequently reconfigured to enable edge
detection then the allocation of the kfifo to contain edge events is
overlooked.  This results in events being written to and read from an
uninitialised kfifo.  Read events are returned to userspace.

Initialise the kfifo in the case where the software debounce is
already active.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36898 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
