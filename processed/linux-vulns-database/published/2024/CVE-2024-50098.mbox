Subject: CVE-2024-50098: scsi: ufs: core: Set SDEV_OFFLINE when UFS is shut down

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Set SDEV_OFFLINE when UFS is shut down

There is a history of deadlock if reboot is performed at the beginning
of booting. SDEV_QUIESCE was set for all LU's scsi_devices by UFS
shutdown, and at that time the audio driver was waiting on
blk_mq_submit_bio() holding a mutex_lock while reading the fw binary.
After that, a deadlock issue occurred while audio driver shutdown was
waiting for mutex_unlock of blk_mq_submit_bio(). To solve this, set
SDEV_OFFLINE for all LUs except WLUN, so that any I/O that comes down
after a UFS shutdown will return an error.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
