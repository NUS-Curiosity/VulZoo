Subject: CVE-2024-47727: x86/tdx: Fix "in-kernel MMIO" check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/tdx: Fix "in-kernel MMIO" check

TDX only supports kernel-initiated MMIO operations. The handle_mmio()
function checks if the #VE exception occurred in the kernel and rejects
the operation if it did not.

However, userspace can deceive the kernel into performing MMIO on its
behalf. For example, if userspace can point a syscall to an MMIO address,
syscall does get_user() or put_user() on it, triggering MMIO #VE. The
kernel will treat the #VE as in-kernel MMIO.

Ensure that the target MMIO address is within the kernel before decoding
instruction.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47727 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
