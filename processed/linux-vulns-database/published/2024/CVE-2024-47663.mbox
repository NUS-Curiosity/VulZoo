Subject: CVE-2024-47663: staging: iio: frequency: ad9834: Validate frequency parameter value

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

staging: iio: frequency: ad9834: Validate frequency parameter value

In ad9834_write_frequency() clk_get_rate() can return 0. In such case
ad9834_calc_freqreg() call will lead to division by zero. Checking
'if (fout > (clk_freq / 2))' doesn't protect in case of 'fout' is 0.
ad9834_write_frequency() is called from ad9834_write(), where fout is
taken from text buffer, which can contain any value.

Modify parameters checking.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47663 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
