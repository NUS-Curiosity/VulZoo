Subject: CVE-2024-26993: fs: sysfs: Fix reference leak in sysfs_break_active_protection()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs: sysfs: Fix reference leak in sysfs_break_active_protection()

The sysfs_break_active_protection() routine has an obvious reference
leak in its error path.  If the call to kernfs_find_and_get() fails then
kn will be NULL, so the companion sysfs_unbreak_active_protection()
routine won't get called (and would only cause an access violation by
trying to dereference kn->parent if it was called).  As a result, the
reference to kobj acquired at the start of the function will never be
released.

Fix the leak by adding an explicit kobject_put() call when kn is NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26993 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
