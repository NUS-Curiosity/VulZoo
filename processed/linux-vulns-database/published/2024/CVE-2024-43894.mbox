Subject: CVE-2024-43894: drm/client: fix null pointer dereference in drm_client_modeset_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/client: fix null pointer dereference in drm_client_modeset_probe

In drm_client_modeset_probe(), the return value of drm_mode_duplicate() is
assigned to modeset->mode, which will lead to a possible NULL pointer
dereference on failure of drm_mode_duplicate(). Add a check to avoid npd.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43894 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
