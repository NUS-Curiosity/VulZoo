Subject: CVE-2024-56785: MIPS: Loongson64: DTS: Really fix PCIe port nodes for ls7a

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

MIPS: Loongson64: DTS: Really fix PCIe port nodes for ls7a

Fix the dtc warnings:

    arch/mips/boot/dts/loongson/ls7a-pch.dtsi:68.16-416.5: Warning (interrupt_provider): /bus@10000000/pci@1a000000: '#interrupt-cells' found, but node is not an interrupt provider
    arch/mips/boot/dts/loongson/ls7a-pch.dtsi:68.16-416.5: Warning (interrupt_provider): /bus@10000000/pci@1a000000: '#interrupt-cells' found, but node is not an interrupt provider
    arch/mips/boot/dts/loongson/loongson64g_4core_ls7a.dtb: Warning (interrupt_map): Failed prerequisite 'interrupt_provider'

And a runtime warning introduced in commit 045b14ca5c36 ("of: WARN on
deprecated #address-cells/#size-cells handling"):

    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at drivers/of/base.c:106 of_bus_n_addr_cells+0x9c/0xe0
    Missing '#address-cells' in /bus@10000000/pci@1a000000/pci_bridge@9,0

The fix is similar to commit d89a415ff8d5 ("MIPS: Loongson64: DTS: Fix PCIe
port nodes for ls7a"), which has fixed the issue for ls2k (despite its
subject mentions ls7a).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56785 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
