Subject: CVE-2024-50109: md/raid10: fix null ptr dereference in raid10_size()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/raid10: fix null ptr dereference in raid10_size()

In raid10_run() if raid10_set_queue_limits() succeed, the return value
is set to zero, and if following procedures failed raid10_run() will
return zero while mddev->private is still NULL, causing null ptr
dereference in raid10_size().

Fix the problem by only overwrite the return value if
raid10_set_queue_limits() failed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50109 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
