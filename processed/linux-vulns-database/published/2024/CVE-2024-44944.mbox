Subject: CVE-2024-44944: netfilter: ctnetlink: use helper function to calculate expect ID

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ctnetlink: use helper function to calculate expect ID

Delete expectation path is missing a call to the nf_expect_get_id()
helper function to calculate the expectation ID, otherwise LSB of the
expectation object address is leaked to userspace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44944 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
