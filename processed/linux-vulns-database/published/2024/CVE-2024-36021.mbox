Subject: CVE-2024-36021: net: hns3: fix kernel crash when devlink reload during pf initialization

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: fix kernel crash when devlink reload during pf initialization

The devlink reload process will access the hardware resources,
but the register operation is done before the hardware is initialized.
So, processing the devlink reload during initialization may lead to kernel
crash. This patch fixes this by taking devl_lock during initialization.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36021 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
