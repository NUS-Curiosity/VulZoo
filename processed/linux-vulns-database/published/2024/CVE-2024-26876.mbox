Subject: CVE-2024-26876: drm/bridge: adv7511: fix crash on irq during probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/bridge: adv7511: fix crash on irq during probe

Moved IRQ registration down to end of adv7511_probe().

If an IRQ already is pending during adv7511_probe
(before adv7511_cec_init) then cec_received_msg_ts
could crash using uninitialized data:

    Unable to handle kernel read from unreadable memory at virtual address 00000000000003d5
    Internal error: Oops: 96000004 [#1] PREEMPT_RT SMP
    Call trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
