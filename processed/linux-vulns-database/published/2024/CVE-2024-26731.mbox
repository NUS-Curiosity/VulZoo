Subject: CVE-2024-26731: bpf, sockmap: Fix NULL pointer dereference in sk_psock_verdict_data_ready()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf, sockmap: Fix NULL pointer dereference in sk_psock_verdict_data_ready()

syzbot reported the following NULL pointer dereference issue [1]:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
  [...]
  RIP: 0010:0x0
  [...]
  Call Trace:

If sk_psock_verdict_data_ready() and sk_psock_stop_verdict() are called
concurrently, psock->saved_data_ready can be NULL, causing the above issue.

This patch fixes this issue by calling the appropriate data ready function
using the sk_psock_data_ready() helper and protecting it from concurrency
with sk->sk_callback_lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26731 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
