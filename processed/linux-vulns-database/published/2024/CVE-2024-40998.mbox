Subject: CVE-2024-40998: ext4: fix uninitialized ratelimit_state->lock access in __ext4_fill_super()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix uninitialized ratelimit_state->lock access in __ext4_fill_super()

In the following concurrency we will access the uninitialized rs->lock:

ext4_fill_super
  ext4_register_sysfs
   // sysfs registered msg_ratelimit_interval_ms
                             // Other processes modify rs->interval to
                             // non-zero via msg_ratelimit_interval_ms
  ext4_orphan_cleanup
    ext4_msg(sb, KERN_INFO, "Errors on filesystem, "
      __ext4_msg
        ___ratelimit(&(EXT4_SB(sb)->s_msg_ratelimit_state)
          if (!rs->interval)  // do nothing if interval is 0
            return 1;
          raw_spin_trylock_irqsave(&rs->lock, flags)
            raw_spin_trylock(lock)
              _raw_spin_trylock
                __raw_spin_trylock
                  spin_acquire(&lock->dep_map, 0, 1, _RET_IP_)
                    lock_acquire
                      __lock_acquire
                        register_lock_class
                          assign_lock_key
                            dump_stack();
  ratelimit_state_init(&sbi->s_msg_ratelimit_state, 5 * HZ, 10);
    raw_spin_lock_init(&rs->lock);
    // init rs->lock here

and get the following dump_stack:

=========================================================

The code is fine but needs lockdep annotation, or maybe
you didn't initialize this object before use?

=========================================================

Normally interval is 0 until s_msg_ratelimit_state is initialized, so
___ratelimit() does nothing. But registering sysfs precedes initializing
rs->lock, so it is possible to change rs->interval to a non-zero value
via the msg_ratelimit_interval_ms interface of sysfs while rs->lock is
uninitialized, and then a call to ext4_msg triggers the problem by
accessing an uninitialized rs->lock. Therefore register sysfs after all
initializations are complete to avoid such problems.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40998 to this issue.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
