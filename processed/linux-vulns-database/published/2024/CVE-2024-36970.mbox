Subject: CVE-2024-36970: wifi: iwlwifi: Use request_module_nowait

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: Use request_module_nowait

This appears to work around a deadlock regression that came in
with the LED merge in 6.9.

The deadlock happens on my system with 24 iwlwifi radios, so maybe
it something like all worker threads are busy and some work that needs
to complete cannot complete.

[also remove unnecessary "load_module" var and now-wrong comment]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36970 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d20013259539e2fde2deeac85354851097afdf9e
