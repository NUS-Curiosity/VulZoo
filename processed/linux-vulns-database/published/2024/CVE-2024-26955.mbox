Subject: CVE-2024-26955: nilfs2: prevent kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: prevent kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()

Fix a bug where nilfs_get_block() returns a successful status when
searching and inserting the specified block both fail inconsistently.  If
this inconsistent behavior is not due to a previously fixed bug, then an
unexpected race is occurring, so return a temporary error -EAGAIN instead.

This prevents callers such as __block_write_begin_int() from requesting a
read into a buffer that is not mapped, which would cause the BUG_ON check
for the BH_Mapped flag in submit_bh_wbc() to fail.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26955 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
