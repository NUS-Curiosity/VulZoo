Subject: CVE-2024-58056: remoteproc: core: Fix ida_free call while not allocated

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: core: Fix ida_free call while not allocated

In the rproc_alloc() function, on error, put_device(&rproc->dev) is
called, leading to the call of the rproc_type_release() function.
An error can occurs before ida_alloc is called.

In such case in rproc_type_release(), the condition (rproc->index >= 0) is
true as rproc->index has been  initialized to 0.
ida_free() is called reporting a warning:

Calling ida_alloc earlier in rproc_alloc ensures that the rproc->index is
properly set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58056 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
