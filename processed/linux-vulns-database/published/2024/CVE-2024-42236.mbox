Subject: CVE-2024-42236: usb: gadget: configfs: Prevent OOB read/write in usb_string_copy()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: configfs: Prevent OOB read/write in usb_string_copy()

Userspace provided string 's' could trivially have the length zero. Left
unchecked this will firstly result in an OOB read in the form
`if (str[0 - 1] == '\n') followed closely by an OOB write in the form
`str[0 - 1] = '\0'`.

There is already a validating check to catch strings that are too long.
Let's supply an additional check for invalid strings that are too short.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42236 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
