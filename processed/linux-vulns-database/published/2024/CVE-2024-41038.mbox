Subject: CVE-2024-41038: firmware: cs_dsp: Prevent buffer overrun when processing V2 alg headers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Prevent buffer overrun when processing V2 alg headers

Check that all fields of a V2 algorithm header fit into the available
firmware data buffer.

The wmfw V2 format introduced variable-length strings in the algorithm
block header. This means the overall header length is variable, and the
position of most fields varies depending on the length of the string
fields. Each field must be checked to ensure that it does not overflow
the firmware data buffer.

As this ia bugfix patch, the fixes avoid making any significant change to
the existing code. This makes it easier to review and less likely to
introduce new bugs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41038 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
