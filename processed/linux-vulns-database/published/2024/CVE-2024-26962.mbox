Subject: CVE-2024-26962: dm-raid456, md/raid456: fix a deadlock for dm-raid456 while io concurrent with reshape

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm-raid456, md/raid456: fix a deadlock for dm-raid456 while io concurrent with reshape

For raid456, if reshape is still in progress, then IO across reshape
position will wait for reshape to make progress. However, for dm-raid,
in following cases reshape will never make progress hence IO will hang:

1) the array is read-only;
2) MD_RECOVERY_WAIT is set;
3) MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set;

After commit c467e97f079f ("md/raid6: use valid sector values to determine
if an I/O should wait on the reshape") fix the problem that IO across
reshape position doesn't wait for reshape, the dm-raid test
shell/lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh start to hang:

[<0>] do_syscall_64+0xc6/0x230
[<0>] entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x6c/0x74

This is because reshape can't make progress.

For md/raid, the problem doesn't exist because register new sync_thread
doesn't rely on the IO to be done any more:

1) If array is read-only, it can switch to read-write by ioctl/sysfs;
2) md/raid never set MD_RECOVERY_WAIT;
3) If MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set, mddev_suspend() doesn't hold
   'reconfig_mutex', hence it can be cleared and reshape can continue by
   sysfs api 'sync_action'.

However, I'm not sure yet how to avoid the problem in dm-raid yet. This
patch on the one hand make sure raid_message() can't change
sync_thread() through raid_message() after presuspend(), on the other
hand detect the above 3 cases before wait for IO do be done in
dm_suspend(), and let dm-raid requeue those IO.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26962 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
