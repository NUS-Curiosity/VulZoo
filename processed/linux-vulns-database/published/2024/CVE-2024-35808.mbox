Subject: CVE-2024-35808: md/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

md/dm-raid: don't call md_reap_sync_thread() directly

Currently md_reap_sync_thread() is called from raid_message() directly
without holding 'reconfig_mutex', this is definitely unsafe because
md_reap_sync_thread() can change many fields that is protected by
'reconfig_mutex'.

However, hold 'reconfig_mutex' here is still problematic because this
will cause deadlock, for example, commit 130443d60b1b ("md: refactor
idle/frozen_sync_thread() to fix deadlock").

Fix this problem by using stop_sync_thread() to unregister sync_thread,
like md/raid did.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35808 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
