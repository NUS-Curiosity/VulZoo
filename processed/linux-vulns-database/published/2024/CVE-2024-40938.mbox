Subject: CVE-2024-40938: landlock: Fix d_parent walk

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

landlock: Fix d_parent walk

The WARN_ON_ONCE() in collect_domain_accesses() can be triggered when
trying to link a root mount point.  This cannot work in practice because
this directory is mounted, but the VFS check is done after the call to
security_path_link().

Do not use source directory's d_parent when the source directory is the
mount point.

[mic: Fix commit message]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40938 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
