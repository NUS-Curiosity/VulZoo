Subject: CVE-2024-58085: tomoyo: don't emit warning in tomoyo_write_control()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tomoyo: don't emit warning in tomoyo_write_control()

syzbot is reporting too large allocation warning at tomoyo_write_control(),
for one can write a very very long line without new line character. To fix
this warning, I use __GFP_NOWARN rather than checking for KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE,
for practically a valid line should be always shorter than 32KB where the
"too small to fail" memory-allocation rule applies.

One might try to write a valid line that is longer than 32KB, but such
request will likely fail with -ENOMEM. Therefore, I feel that separately
returning -EINVAL when a line is longer than KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE is redundant.
There is no need to distinguish over-32KB and over-KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58085 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
