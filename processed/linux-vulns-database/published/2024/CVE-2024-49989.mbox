Subject: CVE-2024-49989: drm/amd/display: fix double free issue during amdgpu module unload

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: fix double free issue during amdgpu module unload

Flexible endpoints use DIGs from available inflexible endpoints,
so only the encoders of inflexible links need to be freed.
Otherwise, a double free issue may occur when unloading the
amdgpu module.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
