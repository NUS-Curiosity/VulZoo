Subject: CVE-2024-36905: tcp: defer shutdown(SEND_SHUTDOWN) for TCP_SYN_RECV sockets

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: defer shutdown(SEND_SHUTDOWN) for TCP_SYN_RECV sockets

TCP_SYN_RECV state is really special, it is only used by
cross-syn connections, mostly used by fuzzers.

In the following crash [1], syzbot managed to trigger a divide
by zero in tcp_rcv_space_adjust()

A socket makes the following state transitions,
without ever calling tcp_init_transfer(),
meaning tcp_init_buffer_space() is also not called.

         TCP_CLOSE
connect()
         TCP_SYN_SENT
         TCP_SYN_RECV
shutdown() -> tcp_shutdown(sk, SEND_SHUTDOWN)
         TCP_FIN_WAIT1

To fix this issue, change tcp_shutdown() to not
perform a TCP_SYN_RECV -> TCP_FIN_WAIT1 transition,
which makes no sense anyway.

When tcp_rcv_state_process() later changes socket state
from TCP_SYN_RECV to TCP_ESTABLISH, then look at
sk->sk_shutdown to finally enter TCP_FIN_WAIT1 state,
and send a FIN packet from a sane socket state.

This means tcp_send_fin() can now be called from BH
context, and must use GFP_ATOMIC allocations.

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
