Subject: CVE-2024-26591: bpf: Fix re-attachment branch in bpf_tracing_prog_attach

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix re-attachment branch in bpf_tracing_prog_attach

The following case can cause a crash due to missing attach_btf:

1) load rawtp program
2) load fentry program with rawtp as target_fd
3) create tracing link for fentry program with target_fd = 0
4) repeat 3

In the end we have:

- prog->aux->dst_trampoline == NULL
- tgt_prog == NULL (because we did not provide target_fd to link_create)
- prog->aux->attach_btf == NULL (the program was loaded with attach_prog_fd=X)
- the program was loaded for tgt_prog but we have no way to find out which one

    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000058

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
