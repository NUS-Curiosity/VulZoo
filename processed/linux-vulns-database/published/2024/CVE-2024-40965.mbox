Subject: CVE-2024-40965: i2c: lpi2c: Avoid calling clk_get_rate during transfer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: lpi2c: Avoid calling clk_get_rate during transfer

Instead of repeatedly calling clk_get_rate for each transfer, lock
the clock rate and cache the value.
A deadlock has been observed while adding tlv320aic32x4 audio codec to
the system. When this clock provider adds its clock, the clk mutex is
locked already, it needs to access i2c, which in return needs the mutex
for clk_get_rate as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40965 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.9.7 with commit 2b42e9587a7a
	Fixed in 6.10 with commit 4268254a3948

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-40965
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-imx-lpi2c.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
