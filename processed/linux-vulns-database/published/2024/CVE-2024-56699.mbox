Subject: CVE-2024-56699: s390/pci: Fix potential double remove of hotplug slot

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/pci: Fix potential double remove of hotplug slot

In commit 6ee600bfbe0f ("s390/pci: remove hotplug slot when releasing the
device") the zpci_exit_slot() was moved from zpci_device_reserved() to
zpci_release_device() with the intention of keeping the hotplug slot
around until the device is actually removed.

Now zpci_release_device() is only called once all references are
dropped. Since the zPCI subsystem only drops its reference once the
device is in the reserved state it follows that zpci_release_device()
must only deal with devices in the reserved state. Despite that it
contains code to tear down from both configured and standby state. For
the standby case this already includes the removal of the hotplug slot
so would cause a double removal if a device was ever removed in
either configured or standby state.

Instead of causing a potential double removal in a case that should
never happen explicitly WARN_ON() if a device in non-reserved state is
released and get rid of the dead code cases.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56699 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
