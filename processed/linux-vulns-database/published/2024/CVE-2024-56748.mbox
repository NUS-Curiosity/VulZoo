Subject: CVE-2024-56748: scsi: qedf: Fix a possible memory leak in qedf_alloc_and_init_sb()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qedf: Fix a possible memory leak in qedf_alloc_and_init_sb()

Hook "qed_ops->common->sb_init = qed_sb_init" does not release the DMA
memory sb_virt when it fails. Add dma_free_coherent() to free it. This
is the same way as qedr_alloc_mem_sb() and qede_alloc_mem_sb().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56748 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
