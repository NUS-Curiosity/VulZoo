Subject: CVE-2024-39463: 9p: add missing locking around taking dentry fid list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

9p: add missing locking around taking dentry fid list

Fix a use-after-free on dentry's d_fsdata fid list when a thread
looks up a fid through dentry while another thread unlinks it:

UAF thread:
refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
 p9_fid_get linux/./include/net/9p/client.h:262
 v9fs_fid_find+0x236/0x280 linux/fs/9p/fid.c:129
 v9fs_fid_lookup_with_uid linux/fs/9p/fid.c:181
 v9fs_fid_lookup+0xbf/0xc20 linux/fs/9p/fid.c:314
 v9fs_vfs_getattr_dotl+0xf9/0x360 linux/fs/9p/vfs_inode_dotl.c:400
 vfs_statx+0xdd/0x4d0 linux/fs/stat.c:248

Freed by:
 p9_fid_destroy (inlined)
 p9_client_clunk+0xb0/0xe0 linux/net/9p/client.c:1456
 p9_fid_put linux/./include/net/9p/client.h:278
 v9fs_dentry_release+0xb5/0x140 linux/fs/9p/vfs_dentry.c:55
 v9fs_remove+0x38f/0x620 linux/fs/9p/vfs_inode.c:518
 vfs_unlink+0x29a/0x810 linux/fs/namei.c:4335

The problem is that d_fsdata was not accessed under d_lock, because
d_release() normally is only called once the dentry is otherwise no
longer accessible but since we also call it explicitly in v9fs_remove
that lock is required:
move the hlist out of the dentry under lock then unref its fids once
they are no longer accessible.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39463 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
