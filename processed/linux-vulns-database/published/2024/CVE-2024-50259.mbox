Subject: CVE-2024-50259: netdevsim: Add trailing zero to terminate the string in nsim_nexthop_bucket_activity_write()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netdevsim: Add trailing zero to terminate the string in nsim_nexthop_bucket_activity_write()

This was found by a static analyzer.
We should not forget the trailing zero after copy_from_user()
if we will further do some string operations, sscanf() in this
case. Adding a trailing zero will ensure that the function
performs properly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50259 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
