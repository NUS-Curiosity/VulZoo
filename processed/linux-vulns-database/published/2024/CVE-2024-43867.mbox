Subject: CVE-2024-43867: drm/nouveau: prime: fix refcount underflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau: prime: fix refcount underflow

Calling nouveau_bo_ref() on a nouveau_bo without initializing it (and
hence the backing ttm_bo) leads to a refcount underflow.

Instead of calling nouveau_bo_ref() in the unwind path of
drm_gem_object_init(), clean things up manually.

(cherry picked from commit 1b93f3e89d03cfc576636e195466a0d728ad8de5)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43867 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
