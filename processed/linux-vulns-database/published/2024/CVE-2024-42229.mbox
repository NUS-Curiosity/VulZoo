Subject: CVE-2024-42229: crypto: aead,cipher - zeroize key buffer after use

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: aead,cipher - zeroize key buffer after use

I.G 9.7.B for FIPS 140-3 specifies that variables temporarily holding
cryptographic information should be zeroized once they are no longer
needed. Accomplish this by using kfree_sensitive for buffers that
previously held the private key.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42229 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
