Subject: CVE-2024-36244: net/sched: taprio: extend minimum interval restriction to entire cycle too

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: taprio: extend minimum interval restriction to entire cycle too

It is possible for syzbot to side-step the restriction imposed by the
blamed commit in the Fixes: tag, because the taprio UAPI permits a
cycle-time different from (and potentially shorter than) the sum of
entry intervals.

We need one more restriction, which is that the cycle time itself must
be larger than N * ETH_ZLEN bit times, where N is the number of schedule
entries. This restriction needs to apply regardless of whether the cycle
time came from the user or was the implicit, auto-calculated value, so
we move the existing "cycle == 0" check outside the "if "(!new->cycle_time)"
branch. This way covers both conditions and scenarios.

Add a selftest which illustrates the issue triggered by syzbot.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36244 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
