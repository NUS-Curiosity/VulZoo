Subject: CVE-2024-36897: drm/amd/display: Atom Integrated System Info v2_2 for DCN35

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Atom Integrated System Info v2_2 for DCN35

New request from KMD/VBIOS in order to support new UMA carveout
model. This fixes a null dereference from accessing
Ctx->dc_bios->integrated_info while it was NULL.

DAL parses through the BIOS and extracts the necessary
integrated_info but was missing a case for the new BIOS
version 2.3.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36897 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
