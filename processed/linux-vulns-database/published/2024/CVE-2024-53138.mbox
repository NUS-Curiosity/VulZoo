Subject: CVE-2024-53138: net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix incorrect page refcounting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: kTLS, Fix incorrect page refcounting

The kTLS tx handling code is using a mix of get_page() and
page_ref_inc() APIs to increment the page reference. But on the release
path (mlx5e_ktls_tx_handle_resync_dump_comp()), only put_page() is used.

This is an issue when using pages from large folios: the get_page()
references are stored on the folio page while the page_ref_inc()
references are stored directly in the given page. On release the folio
page will be dereferenced too many times.

This was found while doing kTLS testing with sendfile() + ZC when the
served file was read from NFS on a kernel with NFS large folios support
(commit 49b29a573da8 ("nfs: add support for large folios")).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53138 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
