Subject: CVE-2024-57925: ksmbd: fix a missing return value check bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix a missing return value check bug

In the smb2_send_interim_resp(), if ksmbd_alloc_work_struct()
fails to allocate a node, it returns a NULL pointer to the
in_work pointer. This can lead to an illegal memory write of
in_work->response_buf when allocate_interim_rsp_buf() attempts
to perform a kzalloc() on it.

To address this issue, incorporating a check for the return
value of ksmbd_alloc_work_struct() ensures that the function
returns immediately upon allocation failure, thereby preventing
the aforementioned illegal memory access.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57925 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
