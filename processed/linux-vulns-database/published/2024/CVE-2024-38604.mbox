Subject: CVE-2024-38604: block: refine the EOF check in blkdev_iomap_begin

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: refine the EOF check in blkdev_iomap_begin

blkdev_iomap_begin rounds down the offset to the logical block size
before stashing it in iomap->offset and checking that it still is
inside the inode size.

Check the i_size check to the raw pos value so that we don't try a
zero size write if iter->pos is unaligned.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38604 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
