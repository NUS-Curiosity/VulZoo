Subject: CVE-2024-27044: drm/amd/display: Fix potential NULL pointer dereferences in 'dcn10_set_output_transfer_func()'

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix potential NULL pointer dereferences in 'dcn10_set_output_transfer_func()'

The 'stream' pointer is used in dcn10_set_output_transfer_func() before
the check if 'stream' is NULL.

Fixes the below:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/hwss/dcn10/dcn10_hwseq.c:1892 dcn10_set_output_transfer_func() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'stream' (see line 1875)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27044 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
