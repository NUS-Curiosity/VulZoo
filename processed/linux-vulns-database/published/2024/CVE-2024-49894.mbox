Subject: CVE-2024-49894: drm/amd/display: Fix index out of bounds in degamma hardware format translation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix index out of bounds in degamma hardware format translation

Fixes index out of bounds issue in
`cm_helper_translate_curve_to_degamma_hw_format` function. The issue
could occur when the index 'i' exceeds the number of transfer function
points (TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS).

The fix adds a check to ensure 'i' is within bounds before accessing the
transfer function points. If 'i' is out of bounds the function returns
false to indicate an error.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
