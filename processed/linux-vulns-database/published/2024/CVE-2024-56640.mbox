Subject: CVE-2024-56640: net/smc: fix LGR and link use-after-free issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/smc: fix LGR and link use-after-free issue

We encountered a LGR/link use-after-free issue, which manifested as
the LGR/link refcnt reaching 0 early and entering the clear process,
making resource access unsafe.

 refcount_t: addition on 0; use-after-free.
 WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 107447 at lib/refcount.c:25 refcount_warn_saturate+0x9c/0x140

  worker_thread+0x158/0x510

It is caused by repeated release of LGR/link refcnt. One suspect is that
smc_conn_free() is called repeatedly because some smc_conn_free() from
server listening path are not protected by sock lock.

e.g.

Calls under socklock        | smc_listen_work
-------------------------------------------------------
lock_sock(sk)               | smc_conn_abort
smc_conn_free               | \- smc_conn_free
\- smcr_link_put            |    \- smcr_link_put (duplicated)
release_sock(sk)

So here add sock lock protection in smc_listen_work() path, making it
exclusive with other connection operations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56640 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
