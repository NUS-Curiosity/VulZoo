Subject: CVE-2024-50213: drm/tests: hdmi: Fix memory leaks in drm_display_mode_from_cea_vic()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/tests: hdmi: Fix memory leaks in drm_display_mode_from_cea_vic()

modprobe drm_hdmi_state_helper_test and then rmmod it, the following
memory leak occurs.

The `mode` allocated in drm_mode_duplicate() called by
drm_display_mode_from_cea_vic() is not freed, which cause the memory leak:

Free `mode` by using drm_kunit_display_mode_from_cea_vic()
to fix it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3bc3fae8a0f22e0e713729b50e2111f6a8c64724
