Subject: CVE-2024-43852: hwmon: (ltc2991) re-order conditions to fix off by one bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (ltc2991) re-order conditions to fix off by one bug

LTC2991_T_INT_CH_NR is 4.  The st->temp_en[] array has LTC2991_MAX_CHANNEL
(4) elements.  Thus if "channel" is equal to LTC2991_T_INT_CH_NR then we
have read one element beyond the end of the array.  Flip the conditions
around so that we check if "channel" is valid before using it as an array
index.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43852 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c180311c0a520692e2d0e9ca44dcd6c2ff1b41c4
