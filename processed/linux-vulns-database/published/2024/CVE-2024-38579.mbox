Subject: CVE-2024-38579: crypto: bcm - Fix pointer arithmetic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: bcm - Fix pointer arithmetic

In spu2_dump_omd() value of ptr is increased by ciph_key_len
instead of hash_iv_len which could lead to going beyond the
buffer boundaries.
Fix this bug by changing ciph_key_len to hash_iv_len.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38579 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
