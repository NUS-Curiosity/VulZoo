Subject: CVE-2024-26632: block: Fix iterating over an empty bio with bio_for_each_folio_all

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Fix iterating over an empty bio with bio_for_each_folio_all

If the bio contains no data, bio_first_folio() calls page_folio() on a
NULL pointer and oopses.  Move the test that we've reached the end of
the bio from bio_next_folio() to bio_first_folio().

[axboe: add unlikely() to error case]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26632 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
