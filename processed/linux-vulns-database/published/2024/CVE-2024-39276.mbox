Subject: CVE-2024-39276: ext4: fix mb_cache_entry's e_refcnt leak in ext4_xattr_block_cache_find()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix mb_cache_entry's e_refcnt leak in ext4_xattr_block_cache_find()

Syzbot reports a warning as follows:

============================================
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 5075 at fs/mbcache.c:419 mb_cache_destroy+0x224/0x290
Modules linked in:

Call Trace:

 ext4_kill_sb+0x68/0xa0 fs/ext4/super.c:7327
[...]
============================================

This is because when finding an entry in ext4_xattr_block_cache_find(), if
ext4_sb_bread() returns -ENOMEM, the ce's e_refcnt, which has already grown
in the __entry_find(), won't be put away, and eventually trigger the above
issue in mb_cache_destroy() due to reference count leakage.

So call mb_cache_entry_put() on the -ENOMEM error branch as a quick fix.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39276 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
