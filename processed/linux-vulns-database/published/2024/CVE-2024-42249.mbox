Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: don't unoptimize message in spi_async()

Calling spi_maybe_unoptimize_message() in spi_async() is wrong because
the message is likely to be in the queue and not transferred yet. This
can corrupt the message while it is being used by the controller driver.

spi_maybe_unoptimize_message() is already called in the correct place
in spi_finalize_current_message() to balance the call to
spi_maybe_optimize_message() in spi_async().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42249 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.9 with commit 7b1d87af14d9 and fixed in 6.9.10 with commit 8b9af6d67517

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-42249
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/spi/spi.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b9af6d67517ce4a0015928b3cf35bfd2b1bc1c2
