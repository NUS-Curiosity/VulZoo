Subject: CVE-2024-49986: platform/x86: x86-android-tablets: Fix use after free on platform_device_register() errors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: x86-android-tablets: Fix use after free on platform_device_register() errors

x86_android_tablet_remove() frees the pdevs[] array, so it should not
be used after calling x86_android_tablet_remove().

When platform_device_register() fails, store the pdevs[x] PTR_ERR() value
into the local ret variable before calling x86_android_tablet_remove()
to avoid using pdevs[] after it has been freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49986 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
