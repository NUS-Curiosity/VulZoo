Subject: CVE-2024-49983: ext4: drop ppath from ext4_ext_replay_update_ex() to avoid double-free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: drop ppath from ext4_ext_replay_update_ex() to avoid double-free

When calling ext4_force_split_extent_at() in ext4_ext_replay_update_ex(),
the 'ppath' is updated but it is the 'path' that is freed, thus potentially
triggering a double-free in the following process:

ext4_ext_replay_update_ex
  ppath = path
  ext4_force_split_extent_at(&ppath)
    ext4_split_extent_at
      ext4_ext_insert_extent
        ext4_ext_create_new_leaf
          ext4_ext_grow_indepth
            ext4_find_extent
              if (depth > path[0].p_maxdepth)
                kfree(path)                 ---> path First freed
                *orig_path = path = NULL    ---> null ppath
  kfree(path)                               ---> path double-free !!!

So drop the unnecessary ppath and use path directly to avoid this problem.
And use ext4_find_extent() directly to update path, avoiding unnecessary
memory allocation and freeing. Also, propagate the error returned by
ext4_find_extent() instead of using strange error codes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49983 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
