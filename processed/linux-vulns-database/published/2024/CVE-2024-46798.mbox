Subject: CVE-2024-46798: ASoC: dapm: Fix UAF for snd_soc_pcm_runtime object

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: dapm: Fix UAF for snd_soc_pcm_runtime object

When using kernel with the following extra config,

  - CONFIG_KASAN=y
  - CONFIG_KASAN_GENERIC=y
  - CONFIG_KASAN_INLINE=y
  - CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC=y
  - CONFIG_FRAME_WARN=4096

kernel detects that snd_pcm_suspend_all() access a freed
'snd_soc_pcm_runtime' object when the system is suspended, which
leads to a use-after-free bug:

[   52.047746] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in snd_pcm_suspend_all+0x1a8/0x270
[   52.047765] Read of size 1 at addr ffff0000b9434d50 by task systemd-sleep/2330

[   52.047824]  snd_soc_suspend+0x19c/0x4e0

The snd_pcm_sync_stop() has a NULL check on 'substream->runtime' before
making any access. So we need to always set 'substream->runtime' to NULL
everytime we kfree() it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46798 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
