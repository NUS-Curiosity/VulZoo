Subject: CVE-2024-41055: mm: prevent derefencing NULL ptr in pfn_section_valid()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: prevent derefencing NULL ptr in pfn_section_valid()

Commit 5ec8e8ea8b77 ("mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing
memory_section->usage") changed pfn_section_valid() to add a READ_ONCE()
call around "ms->usage" to fix a race with section_deactivate() where
ms->usage can be cleared.  The READ_ONCE() call, by itself, is not enough
to prevent NULL pointer dereference.  We need to check its value before
dereferencing it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41055 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
