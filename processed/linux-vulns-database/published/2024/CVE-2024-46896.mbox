Subject: CVE-2024-46896: drm/amdgpu: don't access invalid sched

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: don't access invalid sched

Since 2320c9e6a768 ("drm/sched: memset() 'job' in drm_sched_job_init()")
accessing job->base.sched can produce unexpected results as the initialisation
of (*job)->base.sched done in amdgpu_job_alloc is overwritten by the
memset.

This commit fixes an issue when a CS would fail validation and would
be rejected after job->num_ibs is incremented. In this case,
amdgpu_ib_free(ring->adev, ...) will be called, which would crash the
machine because the ring value is bogus.

To fix this, pass a NULL pointer to amdgpu_ib_free(): we can do this
because the device is actually not used in this function.

The next commit will remove the ring argument completely.

(cherry picked from commit 2ae520cb12831d264ceb97c61f72c59d33c0dbd7)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46896 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
