Subject: CVE-2024-40957: seg6: fix parameter passing when calling NF_HOOK() in End.DX4 and End.DX6 behaviors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

seg6: fix parameter passing when calling NF_HOOK() in End.DX4 and End.DX6 behaviors

input_action_end_dx4() and input_action_end_dx6() are called NF_HOOK() for
PREROUTING hook, in PREROUTING hook, we should passing a valid indev,
and a NULL outdev to NF_HOOK(), otherwise may trigger a NULL pointer
dereference, as below:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
