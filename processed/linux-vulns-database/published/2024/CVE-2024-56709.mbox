Subject: CVE-2024-56709: io_uring: check if iowq is killed before queuing

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: check if iowq is killed before queuing

task work can be executed after the task has gone through io_uring
termination, whether it's the final task_work run or the fallback path.
In this case, task work will find ->io_wq being already killed and
null'ed, which is a problem if it then tries to forward the request to
io_queue_iowq(). Make io_queue_iowq() fail requests in this case.

Note that it also checks PF_KTHREAD, because the user can first close
a DEFER_TASKRUN ring and shortly after kill the task, in which case
->iowq check would race.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56709 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
