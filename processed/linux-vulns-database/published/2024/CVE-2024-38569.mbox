Subject: CVE-2024-38569: drivers/perf: hisi_pcie: Fix out-of-bound access when valid event group

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/perf: hisi_pcie: Fix out-of-bound access when valid event group

The perf tool allows users to create event groups through following
cmd [1], but the driver does not check whether the array index is out of
bounds when writing data to the event_group array. If the number of events
in an event_group is greater than HISI_PCIE_MAX_COUNTERS, the memory write
overflow of event_group array occurs.

Add array index check to fix the possible array out of bounds violation,
and return directly when write new events are written to array bounds.

There are 9 different events in an event_group.
[1] perf stat -e '{pmu/event1/, ... ,pmu/event9/}'

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38569 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
