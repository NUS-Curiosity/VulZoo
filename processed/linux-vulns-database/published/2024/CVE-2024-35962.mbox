Subject: CVE-2024-35962: netfilter: complete validation of user input

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: complete validation of user input

In my recent commit, I missed that do_replace() handlers
use copy_from_sockptr() (which I fixed), followed
by unsafe copy_from_sockptr_offset() calls.

In all functions, we can perform the @optlen validation
before even calling xt_alloc_table_info() with the following
check:

if ((u64)optlen < (u64)tmp.size + sizeof(tmp))
        return -EINVAL;

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35962 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
