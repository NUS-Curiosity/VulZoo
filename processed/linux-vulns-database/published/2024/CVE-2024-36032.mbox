Subject: CVE-2024-36032: Bluetooth: qca: fix info leak when fetching fw build id

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: qca: fix info leak when fetching fw build id

Add the missing sanity checks and move the 255-byte build-id buffer off
the stack to avoid leaking stack data through debugfs in case the
build-info reply is malformed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36032 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
