Subject: CVE-2024-26799: ASoC: qcom: Fix uninitialized pointer dmactl

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: qcom: Fix uninitialized pointer dmactl

In the case where __lpass_get_dmactl_handle is called and the driver
id dai_id is invalid the pointer dmactl is not being assigned a value,
and dmactl contains a garbage value since it has not been initialized
and so the null check may not work. Fix this to initialize dmactl to
NULL. One could argue that modern compilers will set this to zero, but
it is useful to keep this initialized as per the same way in functions
__lpass_platform_codec_intf_init and lpass_cdc_dma_daiops_hw_params.

Cleans up clang scan build warning:
sound/soc/qcom/lpass-cdc-dma.c:275:7: warning: Branch condition
evaluates to a garbage value [core.uninitialized.Branch]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26799 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
