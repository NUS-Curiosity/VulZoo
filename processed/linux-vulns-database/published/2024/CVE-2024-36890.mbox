Subject: CVE-2024-36890: mm/slab: make __free(kfree) accept error pointers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/slab: make __free(kfree) accept error pointers

Currently, if an automatically freed allocation is an error pointer that
will lead to a crash.  An example of this is in wm831x_gpio_dbg_show().

   171	char *label __free(kfree) = gpiochip_dup_line_label(chip, i);
   172	if (IS_ERR(label)) {
   173		dev_err(wm831x->dev, "Failed to duplicate label\n");
   174		continue;
   175  }

The auto clean up function should check for error pointers as well,
otherwise we're going to keep hitting issues like this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36890 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
