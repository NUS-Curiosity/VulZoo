Subject: CVE-2024-40964: ALSA: hda: cs35l41: Possible null pointer dereference in cs35l41_hda_unbind()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: cs35l41: Possible null pointer dereference in cs35l41_hda_unbind()

The cs35l41_hda_unbind() function clears the hda_component entry
matching it's index and then dereferences the codec pointer held in the
first element of the hda_component array, this is an issue when the
device index was 0.

Instead use the codec pointer stashed in the cs35l41_hda structure as it
will still be valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40964 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
