Subject: CVE-2024-53235: erofs: fix file-backed mounts over FUSE

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix file-backed mounts over FUSE

syzbot reported a null-ptr-deref in fuse_read_args_fill:
 fuse_read_folio+0xb0/0x100 fs/fuse/file.c:905
 filemap_read_folio+0xc6/0x2a0 mm/filemap.c:2367
 do_read_cache_folio+0x263/0x5c0 mm/filemap.c:3825
 read_mapping_folio include/linux/pagemap.h:1011 [inline]
 erofs_bread+0x34d/0x7e0 fs/erofs/data.c:41
 erofs_read_superblock fs/erofs/super.c:281 [inline]
 erofs_fc_fill_super+0x2b9/0x2500 fs/erofs/super.c:625

Unlike most filesystems, some network filesystems and FUSE need
unavoidable valid `file` pointers for their read I/Os [1].
Anyway, those use cases need to be supported too.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5036f2f024cac40a02ea6ea70de2c3a4407d16bc
