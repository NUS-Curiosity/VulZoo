Subject: CVE-2024-49941: gpiolib: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in gpiod_get_label()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in gpiod_get_label()

In `gpiod_get_label()`, it is possible that `srcu_dereference_check()` may
return a NULL pointer, leading to a scenario where `label->str` is accessed
without verifying if `label` itself is NULL.

This patch adds a proper NULL check for `label` before accessing
`label->str`. The check for `label->str != NULL` is removed because
`label->str` can never be NULL if `label` is not NULL.

This fixes the issue where the label name was being printed as `(efault)`
when dumping the sysfs GPIO file when `label == NULL`.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49941 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9ee4b907d7a5d7a53b4ff7727c371ff3d44ccbbb
