Subject: CVE-2024-26649: drm/amdgpu: Fix the null pointer when load rlc firmware

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix the null pointer when load rlc firmware

If the RLC firmware is invalid because of wrong header size,
the pointer to the rlc firmware is released in function
amdgpu_ucode_request. There will be a null pointer error
in subsequent use. So skip validation to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26649 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
