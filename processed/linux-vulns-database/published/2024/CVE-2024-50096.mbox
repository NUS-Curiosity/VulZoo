Subject: CVE-2024-50096: nouveau/dmem: Fix vulnerability in migrate_to_ram upon copy error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nouveau/dmem: Fix vulnerability in migrate_to_ram upon copy error

The `nouveau_dmem_copy_one` function ensures that the copy push command is
sent to the device firmware but does not track whether it was executed
successfully.

In the case of a copy error (e.g., firmware or hardware failure), the
copy push command will be sent via the firmware channel, and
`nouveau_dmem_copy_one` will likely report success, leading to the
`migrate_to_ram` function returning a dirty HIGH_USER page to the user.

This can result in a security vulnerability, as a HIGH_USER page that may
contain sensitive or corrupted data could be returned to the user.

To prevent this vulnerability, we allocate a zero page. Thus, in case of
an error, a non-dirty (zero) page will be returned to the user.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50096 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
