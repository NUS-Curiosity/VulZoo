Subject: CVE-2024-27413: efi/capsule-loader: fix incorrect allocation size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi/capsule-loader: fix incorrect allocation size

gcc-14 notices that the allocation with sizeof(void) on 32-bit architectures
is not enough for a 64-bit phys_addr_t:

drivers/firmware/efi/capsule-loader.c: In function 'efi_capsule_open':
drivers/firmware/efi/capsule-loader.c:295:24: error: allocation of insufficient size '4' for type 'phys_addr_t' {aka 'long long unsigned int'} with size '8' [-Werror=alloc-size]
  295 |         cap_info->phys = kzalloc(sizeof(void *), GFP_KERNEL);
      |                        ^

Use the correct type instead here.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27413 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
