Subject: CVE-2024-50071: pinctrl: nuvoton: fix a double free in ma35_pinctrl_dt_node_to_map_func()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pinctrl: nuvoton: fix a double free in ma35_pinctrl_dt_node_to_map_func()

'new_map' is allocated using devm_* which takes care of freeing the
allocated data on device removal, call to

	.dt_free_map = pinconf_generic_dt_free_map

double frees the map as pinconf_generic_dt_free_map() calls
pinctrl_utils_free_map().

Fix this by using kcalloc() instead of auto-managed devm_kcalloc().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50071 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
