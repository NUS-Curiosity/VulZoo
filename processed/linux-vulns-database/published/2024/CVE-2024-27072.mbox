Subject: CVE-2024-27072: media: usbtv: Remove useless locks in usbtv_video_free()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: usbtv: Remove useless locks in usbtv_video_free()

Remove locks calls in usbtv_video_free() because
are useless and may led to a deadlock as reported here:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/x/bisect.txt?x=166dc872180000
Also remove usbtv_stop() call since it will be called when
unregistering the device.

Before 'c838530d230b' this issue would only be noticed if you
disconnect while streaming and now it is noticeable even when
disconnecting while not streaming.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
