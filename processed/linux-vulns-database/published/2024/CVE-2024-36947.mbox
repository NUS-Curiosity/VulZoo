Subject: CVE-2024-36947: qibfs: fix dentry leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

qibfs: fix dentry leak

simple_recursive_removal() drops the pinning references to all positives
in subtree.  For the cases when its argument has been kept alive by
the pinning alone that's exactly the right thing to do, but here
the argument comes from dcache lookup, that needs to be balanced by
explicit dput().

Fucked-up-by: Al Viro <viro@zeniv.linux.org.uk>

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36947 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
