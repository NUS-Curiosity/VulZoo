Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/mm: Add NULL pointer check to crst_table_free() base_crst_free()

crst_table_free() used to work with NULL pointers before the conversion
to ptdescs.  Since crst_table_free() can be called with a NULL pointer
(error handling in crst_table_upgrade() add an explicit check.

Also add the same check to base_crst_free() for consistency reasons.

In real life this should not happen, since order two GFP_KERNEL
allocations will not fail, unless FAIL_PAGE_ALLOC is enabled and used.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42235 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
