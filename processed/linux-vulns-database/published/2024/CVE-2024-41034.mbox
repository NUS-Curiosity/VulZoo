Subject: CVE-2024-41034: nilfs2: fix kernel bug on rename operation of broken directory

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix kernel bug on rename operation of broken directory

Syzbot reported that in rename directory operation on broken directory on
nilfs2, __block_write_begin_int() called to prepare block write may fail
BUG_ON check for access exceeding the folio/page size.

This is because nilfs_dotdot(), which gets parent directory reference
entry ("..") of the directory to be moved or renamed, does not check
consistency enough, and may return location exceeding folio/page size for
broken directories.

Fix this issue by checking required directory entries ("." and "..") in
the first chunk of the directory in nilfs_dotdot().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41034 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
