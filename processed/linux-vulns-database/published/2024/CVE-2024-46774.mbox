Subject: CVE-2024-46774: powerpc/rtas: Prevent Spectre v1 gadget construction in sys_rtas()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/rtas: Prevent Spectre v1 gadget construction in sys_rtas()

Smatch warns:

  arch/powerpc/kernel/rtas.c:1932 __do_sys_rtas() warn: potential
  spectre issue 'args.args' [r] (local cap)

The 'nargs' and 'nret' locals come directly from a user-supplied
buffer and are used as indexes into a small stack-based array and as
inputs to copy_to_user() after they are subject to bounds checks.

Use array_index_nospec() after the bounds checks to clamp these values
for speculative execution.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46774 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/68d8156480940b79227d58865ec5d2947b9384a8
