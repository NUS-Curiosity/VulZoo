Subject: CVE-2024-53088: i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state

Fix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters
becoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under
heavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN
filters by setting mac and port VLAN.

1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().
2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within
        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().
3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which
        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.

Reproduction steps:
1. Spawn multiple VFs.
2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change
        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.
3. Observe errors in dmesg:
"Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,
	please set promiscuous on manually for VF XX".

Exact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.

The fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,
I40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.
These filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but
must be removed using the full process.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53088 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
