Subject: CVE-2024-53067: scsi: ufs: core: Start the RTC update work later

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Start the RTC update work later

The RTC update work involves runtime resuming the UFS controller. Hence,
only start the RTC update work after runtime power management in the UFS
driver has been fully initialized. This patch fixes the following kernel
crash:

Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000006 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
Workqueue: events ufshcd_rtc_work

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
