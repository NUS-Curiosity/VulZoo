Subject: CVE-2024-42319: mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Move devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Move devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable()

When mtk-cmdq unbinds, a WARN_ON message with condition
pm_runtime_get_sync() < 0 occurs.

According to the call tracei below:
  cmdq_mbox_shutdown
  mbox_free_channel
  mbox_controller_unregister
  __devm_mbox_controller_unregister
  ...

The root cause can be deduced to be calling pm_runtime_get_sync() after
calling pm_runtime_disable() as observed below:
1. CMDQ driver uses devm_mbox_controller_register() in cmdq_probe()
   to bind the cmdq device to the mbox_controller, so
   devm_mbox_controller_unregister() will automatically unregister
   the device bound to the mailbox controller when the device-managed
   resource is removed. That means devm_mbox_controller_unregister()
   and cmdq_mbox_shoutdown() will be called after cmdq_remove().
2. CMDQ driver also uses devm_pm_runtime_enable() in cmdq_probe() after
   devm_mbox_controller_register(), so that devm_pm_runtime_disable()
   will be called after cmdq_remove(), but before
   devm_mbox_controller_unregister().

To fix this problem, cmdq_probe() needs to move
devm_mbox_controller_register() after devm_pm_runtime_enable() to make
devm_pm_runtime_disable() be called after
devm_mbox_controller_unregister().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42319 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
