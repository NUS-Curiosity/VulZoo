Subject: CVE-2024-49954: static_call: Replace pointless WARN_ON() in static_call_module_notify()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

static_call: Replace pointless WARN_ON() in static_call_module_notify()

static_call_module_notify() triggers a WARN_ON(), when memory allocation
fails in __static_call_add_module().

That's not really justified, because the failure case must be correctly
handled by the well known call chain and the error code is passed
through to the initiating userspace application.

A memory allocation fail is not a fatal problem, but the WARN_ON() takes
the machine out when panic_on_warn is set.

Replace it with a pr_warn().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49954 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
