Subject: CVE-2024-50193: x86/entry_32: Clear CPU buffers after register restore in NMI return

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/entry_32: Clear CPU buffers after register restore in NMI return

CPU buffers are currently cleared after call to exc_nmi, but before
register state is restored. This may be okay for MDS mitigation but not for
RDFS. Because RDFS mitigation requires CPU buffers to be cleared when
registers don't have any sensitive data.

Move CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS after RESTORE_ALL_NMI.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50193 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
