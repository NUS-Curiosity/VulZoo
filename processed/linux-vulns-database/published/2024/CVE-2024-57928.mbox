Subject: CVE-2024-57928: netfs: Fix enomem handling in buffered reads

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Fix enomem handling in buffered reads

If netfs_read_to_pagecache() gets an error from either ->prepare_read() or
from netfs_prepare_read_iterator(), it needs to decrement ->nr_outstanding,
cancel the subrequest and break out of the issuing loop.  Currently, it
only does this for two of the cases, but there are two more that aren't
handled.

Fix this by moving the handling to a common place and jumping to it from
all four places.  This is in preference to inserting a wrapper around
netfs_prepare_read_iterator() as proposed by Dmitry Antipov[1].

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57928 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/88ecdfea1b333de5c51442b45cd549eeadf01852
