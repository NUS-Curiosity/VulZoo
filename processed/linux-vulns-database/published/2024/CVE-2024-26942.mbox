Subject: CVE-2024-26942: net: phy: qcom: at803x: fix kernel panic with at8031_probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: qcom: at803x: fix kernel panic with at8031_probe

On reworking and splitting the at803x driver, in splitting function of
at803x PHYs it was added a NULL dereference bug where priv is referenced
before it's actually allocated and then is tried to write to for the
is_1000basex and is_fiber variables in the case of at8031, writing on
the wrong address.

Fix this by correctly setting priv local variable only after
at803x_probe is called and actually allocates priv in the phydev struct.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26942 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
