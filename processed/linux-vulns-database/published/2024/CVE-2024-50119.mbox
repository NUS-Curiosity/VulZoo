Subject: CVE-2024-50119: cifs: fix warning when destroy 'cifs_io_request_pool'

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix warning when destroy 'cifs_io_request_pool'

There's a issue as follows:
WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 27826 at mm/slub.c:4698 free_large_kmalloc+0xac/0xe0
RIP: 0010:free_large_kmalloc+0xac/0xe0
Call Trace:
 <TASK>

Obviously, 'cifs_io_request_pool' is not created by mempool_create().
So just use mempool_exit() to revert 'cifs_io_request_pool'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50119 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/726416a253c51037636ecc65ad3dada3d02dcaea
