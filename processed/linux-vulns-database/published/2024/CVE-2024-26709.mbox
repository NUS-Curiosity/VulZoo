Subject: CVE-2024-26709: powerpc/iommu: Fix the missing iommu_group_put() during platform domain attach

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/iommu: Fix the missing iommu_group_put() during platform domain attach

The function spapr_tce_platform_iommu_attach_dev() is missing to call
iommu_group_put() when the domain is already set. This refcount leak
shows up with BUG_ON() during DLPAR remove operation as:

  KernelBug: Kernel bug in state 'None': kernel BUG at arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/iommu.c:100!

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c90fdea9cac9eb419fc266e75d625cb60c8f7f6c
