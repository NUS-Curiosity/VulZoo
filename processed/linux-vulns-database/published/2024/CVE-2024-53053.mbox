Subject: CVE-2024-53053: scsi: ufs: core: Fix another deadlock during RTC update

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix another deadlock during RTC update

If ufshcd_rtc_work calls ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() and the pm's usage_count
is 0, we will enter the runtime suspend callback.  However, the runtime
suspend callback will wait to flush ufshcd_rtc_work, causing a deadlock.

Replace ufshcd_rpm_put_sync() with ufshcd_rpm_put() to avoid the
deadlock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53053 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
