Subject: CVE-2024-49926: rcu-tasks: Fix access non-existent percpu rtpcp variable in rcu_tasks_need_gpcb()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu-tasks: Fix access non-existent percpu rtpcp variable in rcu_tasks_need_gpcb()

For kernels built with CONFIG_FORCE_NR_CPUS=y, the nr_cpu_ids is
defined as NR_CPUS instead of the number of possible cpus, this
will cause the following system panic:

smpboot: Allowing 4 CPUs, 0 hotplug CPUs
...
setup_percpu: NR_CPUS:512 nr_cpumask_bits:512 nr_cpu_ids:512 nr_node_ids:1
...

Considering that there may be holes in the CPU numbers, use the
maximum possible cpu number, instead of nr_cpu_ids, for configuring
enqueue and dequeue limits.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
