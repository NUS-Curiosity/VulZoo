Subject: CVE-2024-39282: net: wwan: t7xx: Fix FSM command timeout issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: wwan: t7xx: Fix FSM command timeout issue

When driver processes the internal state change command, it use an
asynchronous thread to process the command operation. If the main
thread detects that the task has timed out, the asynchronous thread
will panic when executing the completion notification because the
main thread completion object has been released.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
