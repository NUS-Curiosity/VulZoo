Subject: CVE-2024-42237: firmware: cs_dsp: Validate payload length before processing block

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: cs_dsp: Validate payload length before processing block

Move the payload length check in cs_dsp_load() and cs_dsp_coeff_load()
to be done before the block is processed.

The check that the length of a block payload does not exceed the number
of remaining bytes in the firwmware file buffer was being done near the
end of the loop iteration. However, some code before that check used the
length field without validating it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42237 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
