Subject: CVE-2024-53213: net: usb: lan78xx: Fix double free issue with interrupt buffer allocation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: usb: lan78xx: Fix double free issue with interrupt buffer allocation

In lan78xx_probe(), the buffer `buf` was being freed twice: once
implicitly through `usb_free_urb(dev->urb_intr)` with the
`URB_FREE_BUFFER` flag and again explicitly by `kfree(buf)`. This caused
a double free issue.

To resolve this, reordered `kmalloc()` and `usb_alloc_urb()` calls to
simplify the initialization sequence and removed the redundant
`kfree(buf)`.  Now, `buf` is allocated after `usb_alloc_urb()`, ensuring
it is correctly managed by  `usb_fill_int_urb()` and freed by
`usb_free_urb()` as intended.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53213 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
