Subject: CVE-2024-41019: fs/ntfs3: Validate ff offset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/ntfs3: Validate ff offset

This adds sanity checks for ff offset. There is a check
on rt->first_free at first, but walking through by ff
without any check. If the second ff is a large offset.
We may encounter an out-of-bound read.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41019 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
