Subject: CVE-2024-44974: mptcp: pm: avoid possible UaF when selecting endp

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: pm: avoid possible UaF when selecting endp

select_local_address() and select_signal_address() both select an
endpoint entry from the list inside an RCU protected section, but return
a reference to it, to be read later on. If the entry is dereferenced
after the RCU unlock, reading info could cause a Use-after-Free.

A simple solution is to copy the required info while inside the RCU
protected section to avoid any risk of UaF later. The address ID might
need to be modified later to handle the ID0 case later, so a copy seems
OK to deal with.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44974 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
