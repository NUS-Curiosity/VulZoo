Subject: CVE-2024-35928: drm/amd/amdgpu: Fix potential ioremap() memory leaks in amdgpu_device_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/amdgpu: Fix potential ioremap() memory leaks in amdgpu_device_init()

This ensures that the memory mapped by ioremap for adev->rmmio, is
properly handled in amdgpu_device_init(). If the function exits early
due to an error, the memory is unmapped. If the function completes
successfully, the memory remains mapped.

Reported by smatch:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_device.c:4337 amdgpu_device_init() warn: 'adev->rmmio' from ioremap() not released on lines: 4035,4045,4051,4058,4068,4337

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35928 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
