Subject: CVE-2024-47678: icmp: change the order of rate limits

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

icmp: change the order of rate limits

ICMP messages are ratelimited :

After the blamed commits, the two rate limiters are applied in this order:

1) host wide ratelimit (icmp_global_allow())

2) Per destination ratelimit (inetpeer based)

In order to avoid side-channels attacks, we need to apply
the per destination check first.

This patch makes the following change :

1) icmp_global_allow() checks if the host wide limit is reached.
   But credits are not yet consumed. This is deferred to 3)

2) The per destination limit is checked/updated.
   This might add a new node in inetpeer tree.

3) icmp_global_consume() consumes tokens if prior operations succeeded.

This means that host wide ratelimit is still effective
in keeping inetpeer tree small even under DDOS.

As a bonus, I removed icmp_global.lock as the fast path
can use a lock-free operation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47678 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/997ba8889611891f91e8ad83583466aeab6239a3
