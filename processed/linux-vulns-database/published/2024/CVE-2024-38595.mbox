Subject: CVE-2024-38595: net/mlx5: Fix peer devlink set for SF representor devlink port

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Fix peer devlink set for SF representor devlink port

The cited patch change register devlink flow, and neglect to reflect
the changes for peer devlink set logic. Peer devlink set is
triggering a call trace if done after devl_register.[1]

Hence, align peer devlink set logic with register devlink flow.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
