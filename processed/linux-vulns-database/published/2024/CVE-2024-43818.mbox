Subject: CVE-2024-43818: ASoC: amd: Adjust error handling in case of absent codec device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: amd: Adjust error handling in case of absent codec device

acpi_get_first_physical_node() can return NULL in several cases (no such
device, ACPI table error, reference count drop to 0, etc).
Existing check just emit error message, but doesn't perform return.
Then this NULL pointer is passed to devm_acpi_dev_add_driver_gpios()
where it is dereferenced.

Adjust this error handling by adding error code return.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43818 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
