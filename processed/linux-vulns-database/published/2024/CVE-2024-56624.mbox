Subject: CVE-2024-56624: iommufd: Fix out_fput in iommufd_fault_alloc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd: Fix out_fput in iommufd_fault_alloc()

As fput() calls the file->f_op->release op, where fault obj and ictx are
getting released, there is no need to release these two after fput() one
more time, which would result in imbalanced refcounts:
  refcount_t: decrement hit 0; leaking memory.
  WARNING: CPU: 48 PID: 2369 at lib/refcount.c:31 refcount_warn_saturate+0x60/0x230

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2b3f30c8edbf9a122ce01f13f0f41fbca5f1d41d
