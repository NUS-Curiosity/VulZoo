Subject: CVE-2024-42086: iio: chemical: bme680: Fix overflows in compensate() functions

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: chemical: bme680: Fix overflows in compensate() functions

There are cases in the compensate functions of the driver that
there could be overflows of variables due to bit shifting ops.
These implications were initially discussed here [1] and they
were mentioned in log message of Commit 1b3bd8592780 ("iio:
chemical: Add support for Bosch BME680 sensor").

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
