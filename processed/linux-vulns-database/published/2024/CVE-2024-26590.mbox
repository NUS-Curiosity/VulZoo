Subject: CVE-2024-26590: erofs: fix inconsistent per-file compression format

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: fix inconsistent per-file compression format

EROFS can select compression algorithms on a per-file basis, and each
per-file compression algorithm needs to be marked in the on-disk
superblock for initialization.

However, syzkaller can generate inconsistent crafted images that use
an unsupported algorithmtype for specific inodes, e.g. use MicroLZMA
algorithmtype even it's not set in `sbi->available_compr_algs`.  This
can lead to an unexpected "BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference" if
the corresponding decompressor isn't built-in.

Fix this by checking against `sbi->available_compr_algs` for each
m_algorithmformat request.  Incorrect !erofs_sb_has_compr_cfgs preset
bitmap is now fixed together since it was harmless previously.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26590 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
