Subject: CVE-2024-50173: drm/panthor: Fix access to uninitialized variable in tick_ctx_cleanup()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/panthor: Fix access to uninitialized variable in tick_ctx_cleanup()

The group variable can't be used to retrieve ptdev in our second loop,
because it points to the previously iterated list_head, not a valid
group. Get the ptdev object from the scheduler instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50173 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
