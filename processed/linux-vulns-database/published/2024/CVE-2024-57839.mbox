Subject: CVE-2024-57839: Revert "readahead: properly shorten readahead when falling back to do_page_cache_ra()"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "readahead: properly shorten readahead when falling back to do_page_cache_ra()"

This reverts commit 7c877586da3178974a8a94577b6045a48377ff25.

Anders and Philippe have reported that recent kernels occasionally hang
when used with NFS in readahead code.  The problem has been bisected to
7c877586da3 ("readahead: properly shorten readahead when falling back to
do_page_cache_ra()").  The cause of the problem is that ra->size can be
shrunk by read_pages() call and subsequently we end up calling
do_page_cache_ra() with negative (read huge positive) number of pages. 
Let's revert 7c877586da3 for now until we can find a proper way how the
logic in read_pages() and page_cache_ra_order() can coexist.  This can
lead to reduced readahead throughput due to readahead window confusion but
that's better than outright hangs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57839 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
