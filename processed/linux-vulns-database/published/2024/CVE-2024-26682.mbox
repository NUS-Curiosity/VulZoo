Subject: CVE-2024-26682: wifi: mac80211: improve CSA/ECSA connection refusal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: improve CSA/ECSA connection refusal

As mentioned in the previous commit, we pretty quickly found
that some APs have ECSA elements stuck in their probe response,
so using that to not attempt to connect while CSA is happening
we never connect to such an AP.

Improve this situation by checking more carefully and ignoring
the ECSA if cfg80211 has previously detected the ECSA element
being stuck in the probe response.

Additionally, allow connecting to an AP that's switching to a
channel it's already using, unless it's using quiet mode. In
this case, we may just have to adjust bandwidth later. If it's
actually switching channels, it's better not to try to connect
in the middle of that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26682 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ea88bde8e3fefbe4268f6991375dd629895a090a
