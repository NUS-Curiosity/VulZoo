Subject: CVE-2024-50093: thermal: intel: int340x: processor: Fix warning during module unload

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: intel: int340x: processor: Fix warning during module unload

The processor_thermal driver uses pcim_device_enable() to enable a PCI
device, which means the device will be automatically disabled on driver
detach.  Thus there is no need to call pci_disable_device() again on it.

With recent PCI device resource management improvements, e.g. commit
f748a07a0b64 ("PCI: Remove legacy pcim_release()"), this problem is
exposed and triggers the warining below.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
