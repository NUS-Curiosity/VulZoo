Subject: CVE-2024-50101: iommu/vt-d: Fix incorrect pci_for_each_dma_alias() for non-PCI devices

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix incorrect pci_for_each_dma_alias() for non-PCI devices

Previously, the domain_context_clear() function incorrectly called
pci_for_each_dma_alias() to set up context entries for non-PCI devices.
This could lead to kernel hangs or other unexpected behavior.

Add a check to only call pci_for_each_dma_alias() for PCI devices. For
non-PCI devices, domain_context_clear_one() is called directly.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50101 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
