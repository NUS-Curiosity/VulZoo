Subject: CVE-2024-35894: mptcp: prevent BPF accessing lowat from a subflow socket.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: prevent BPF accessing lowat from a subflow socket.

Alexei reported the following splat:

The root cause of the issue is that bpf allows accessing mptcp-level
proto_ops from a tcp subflow scope.

Fix the issue detecting the problematic call and preventing any action.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35894 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
