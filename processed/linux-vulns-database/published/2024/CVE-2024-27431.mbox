Subject: CVE-2024-27431: cpumap: Zero-initialise xdp_rxq_info struct before running XDP program

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cpumap: Zero-initialise xdp_rxq_info struct before running XDP program

When running an XDP program that is attached to a cpumap entry, we don't
initialise the xdp_rxq_info data structure being used in the xdp_buff
that backs the XDP program invocation. Tobias noticed that this leads to
random values being returned as the xdp_md->rx_queue_index value for XDP
programs running in a cpumap.

This means we're basically returning the contents of the uninitialised
memory, which is bad. Fix this by zero-initialising the rxq data
structure before running the XDP program.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27431 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
