Subject: CVE-2024-53108: drm/amd/display: Adjust VSDB parser for replay feature

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Adjust VSDB parser for replay feature

At some point, the IEEE ID identification for the replay check in the
AMD EDID was added. However, this check causes the following
out-of-bounds issues when using KASAN:

[   27.804016] BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in amdgpu_dm_update_freesync_caps+0xefa/0x17a0 [amdgpu]

[   27.821268] ==================================================================

This is caused because the ID extraction happens outside of the range of
the edid lenght. This commit addresses this issue by considering the
amd_vsdb_block size.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0a326fbc8f72a320051f27328d4d4e7abdfe68d7
