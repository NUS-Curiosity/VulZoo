Subject: CVE-2024-58007: soc: qcom: socinfo: Avoid out of bounds read of serial number

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: socinfo: Avoid out of bounds read of serial number

On MSM8916 devices, the serial number exposed in sysfs is constant and does
not change across individual devices. It's always:

  db410c:/sys/devices/soc0$ cat serial_number
  2644893864

The firmware used on MSM8916 exposes SOCINFO_VERSION(0, 8), which does not
have support for the serial_num field in the socinfo struct. There is an
existing check to avoid exposing the serial number in that case, but it's
not correct: When checking the item_size returned by SMEM, we need to make
sure the *end* of the serial_num is within bounds, instead of comparing
with the *start* offset. The serial_number currently exposed on MSM8916
devices is just an out of bounds read of whatever comes after the socinfo
struct in SMEM.

Fix this by changing offsetof() to offsetofend(), so that the size of the
field is also taken into account.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58007 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
