Subject: CVE-2024-36026: drm/amd/pm: fixes a random hang in S4 for SMU v13.0.4/11

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/pm: fixes a random hang in S4 for SMU v13.0.4/11

While doing multiple S4 stress tests, GC/RLC/PMFW get into
an invalid state resulting into hard hangs.

Adding a GFX reset as workaround just before sending the
MP1_UNLOAD message avoids this failure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36026 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
