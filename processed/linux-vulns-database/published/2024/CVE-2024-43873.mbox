Subject: CVE-2024-43873: vhost/vsock: always initialize seqpacket_allow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vhost/vsock: always initialize seqpacket_allow

There are two issues around seqpacket_allow:
1. seqpacket_allow is not initialized when socket is
   created. Thus if features are never set, it will be
   read uninitialized.
2. if VIRTIO_VSOCK_F_SEQPACKET is set and then cleared,
   then seqpacket_allow will not be cleared appropriately
   (existing apps I know about don't usually do this but
    it's legal and there's no way to be sure no one relies
    on this).

To fix:
	- initialize seqpacket_allow after allocation
	- set it unconditionally in set_features

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43873 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
