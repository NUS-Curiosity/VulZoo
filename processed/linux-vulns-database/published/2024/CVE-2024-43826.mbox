Subject: CVE-2024-43826: nfs: pass explicit offset/count to trace events

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfs: pass explicit offset/count to trace events

nfs_folio_length is unsafe to use without having the folio locked and a
check for a NULL ->f_mapping that protects against truncations and can
lead to kernel crashes.  E.g. when running xfstests generic/065 with
all nfs trace points enabled.

Follow the model of the XFS trace points and pass in an expl—ñcit offset
and length.  This has the additional benefit that these values can
be more accurate as some of the users touch partial folio ranges.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43826 to this issue.

	fs/nfs/file.c
	fs/nfs/nfstrace.h
	fs/nfs/read.c
	fs/nfs/write.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
