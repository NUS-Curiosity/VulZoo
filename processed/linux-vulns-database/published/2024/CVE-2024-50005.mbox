Subject: CVE-2024-50005: mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mac802154: Fix potential RCU dereference issue in mac802154_scan_worker

In the `mac802154_scan_worker` function, the `scan_req->type` field was
accessed after the RCU read-side critical section was unlocked. According
to RCU usage rules, this is illegal and can lead to unpredictable
behavior, such as accessing memory that has been updated or causing
use-after-free issues.

This possible bug was identified using a static analysis tool developed
by myself, specifically designed to detect RCU-related issues.

To address this, the `scan_req->type` value is now stored in a local
variable `scan_req_type` while still within the RCU read-side critical
section. The `scan_req_type` is then used after the RCU lock is released,
ensuring that the type value is safely accessed without violating RCU
rules.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50005 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
