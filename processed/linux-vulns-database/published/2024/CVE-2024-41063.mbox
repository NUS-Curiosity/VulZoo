Subject: CVE-2024-41063: Bluetooth: hci_core: cancel all works upon hci_unregister_dev()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_core: cancel all works upon hci_unregister_dev()

syzbot is reporting that calling hci_release_dev() from hci_error_reset()
due to hci_dev_put() from hci_error_reset() can cause deadlock at
destroy_workqueue(), for hci_error_reset() is called from
hdev->req_workqueue which destroy_workqueue() needs to flush.

We need to make sure that hdev->{rx_work,cmd_work,tx_work} which are
queued into hdev->workqueue and hdev->{power_on,error_reset} which are
queued into hdev->req_workqueue are no longer running by the moment

       destroy_workqueue(hdev->workqueue);
       destroy_workqueue(hdev->req_workqueue);

are called from hci_release_dev().

Call cancel_work_sync() on these work items from hci_unregister_dev()
as soon as hdev->list is removed from hci_dev_list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41063 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
