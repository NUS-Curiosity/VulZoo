Subject: CVE-2024-57953: rtc: tps6594: Fix integer overflow on 32bit systems

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtc: tps6594: Fix integer overflow on 32bit systems

The problem is this multiply in tps6594_rtc_set_offset()

	tmp = offset * TICKS_PER_HOUR;

The "tmp" variable is an s64 but "offset" is a long in the
(-277774)-277774 range.  On 32bit systems a long can hold numbers up to
approximately two billion.  The number of TICKS_PER_HOUR is really large,
(32768 * 3600) or roughly a hundred million.  When you start multiplying
by a hundred million it doesn't take long to overflow the two billion
mark.

Probably the safest way to fix this is to change the type of
TICKS_PER_HOUR to long long because it's such a large number.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57953 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
