Subject: CVE-2024-46690: nfsd: fix nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict in presence of third party lease

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: fix nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict in presence of third party lease

It is not safe to dereference fl->c.flc_owner without first confirming
fl->fl_lmops is the expected manager.  nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict()
tests fl_lmops but largely ignores the result and assumes that flc_owner
is an nfs4_delegation anyway.  This is wrong.

With this patch we restore the "!= &nfsd_lease_mng_ops" case to behave
as it did before the change mentioned below.  This is the same as the
current code, but without any reference to a possible delegation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46690 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1b46a871e980e3daa16fd5e77539966492e8910a
