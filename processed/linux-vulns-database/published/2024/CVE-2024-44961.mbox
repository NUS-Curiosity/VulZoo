Subject: CVE-2024-44961: drm/amdgpu: Forward soft recovery errors to userspace

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Forward soft recovery errors to userspace

As we discussed before[1], soft recovery should be
forwarded to userspace, or we can get into a really
bad state where apps will keep submitting hanging
command buffers cascading us to a hard reset.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
