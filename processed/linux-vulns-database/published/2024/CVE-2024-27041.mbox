Subject: CVE-2024-27041: drm/amd/display: fix NULL checks for adev->dm.dc in amdgpu_dm_fini()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: fix NULL checks for adev->dm.dc in amdgpu_dm_fini()

Since 'adev->dm.dc' in amdgpu_dm_fini() might turn out to be NULL
before the call to dc_enable_dmub_notifications(), check
beforehand to ensure there will not be a possible NULL-ptr-deref
there.

Also, since commit 1e88eb1b2c25 ("drm/amd/display: Drop
CONFIG_DRM_AMD_DC_HDCP") there are two separate checks for NULL in
'adev->dm.dc' before dc_deinit_callbacks() and dc_dmub_srv_destroy().
Clean up by combining them all under one 'if'.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static
analysis tool SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27041 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
