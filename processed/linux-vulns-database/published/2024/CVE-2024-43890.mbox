Subject: CVE-2024-43890: tracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()

"tracing_map->next_elt" in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing.

Once it overflows, new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map
even though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached.
Continuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the
tracing_map containing "tracing_map->max_size" elements, leaving no empty
entries.
If any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using
`__tracing_map_insert()`, it will cause an infinite loop with preemption
disabled, leading to a CPU hang problem.

Fix this by preventing any further increments to "tracing_map->next_elt"
once it reaches "tracing_map->max_elt".

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43890 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
