Subject: CVE-2024-26779: wifi: mac80211: fix race condition on enabling fast-xmit

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: fix race condition on enabling fast-xmit

fast-xmit must only be enabled after the sta has been uploaded to the driver,
otherwise it could end up passing the not-yet-uploaded sta via drv_tx calls
to the driver, leading to potential crashes because of uninitialized drv_priv
data.
Add a missing sta->uploaded check and re-check fast xmit after inserting a sta.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26779 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
