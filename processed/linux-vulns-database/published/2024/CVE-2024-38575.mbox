Subject: CVE-2024-38575: wifi: brcmfmac: pcie: handle randbuf allocation failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcmfmac: pcie: handle randbuf allocation failure

The kzalloc() in brcmf_pcie_download_fw_nvram() will return null
if the physical memory has run out. As a result, if we use
get_random_bytes() to generate random bytes in the randbuf, the
null pointer dereference bug will happen.

In order to prevent allocation failure, this patch adds a separate
function using buffer on kernel stack to generate random bytes in
the randbuf, which could prevent the kernel stack from overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38575 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
