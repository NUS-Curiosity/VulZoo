Subject: CVE-2024-46770: ice: Add netif_device_attach/detach into PF reset flow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: Add netif_device_attach/detach into PF reset flow

Ethtool callbacks can be executed while reset is in progress and try to
access deleted resources, e.g. getting coalesce settings can result in a
NULL pointer dereference seen below.

Reproduction steps:
Once the driver is fully initialized, trigger reset:
	# echo 1 > /sys/class/net/<interface>/device/reset
when reset is in progress try to get coalesce settings using ethtool:
	# ethtool -c <interface>

Calling netif_device_detach() before reset makes the net core not call
the driver when ethtool command is issued, the attempt to execute an
ethtool command during reset will result in the following message:

    netlink error: No such device

instead of NULL pointer dereference. Once reset is done and
ice_rebuild() is executing, the netif_device_attach() is called to allow
for ethtool operations to occur again in a safe manner.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46770 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
