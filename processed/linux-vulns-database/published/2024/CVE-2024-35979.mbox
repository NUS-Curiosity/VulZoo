Subject: CVE-2024-35979: raid1: fix use-after-free for original bio in raid1_write_request()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

raid1: fix use-after-free for original bio in raid1_write_request()

r1_bio->bios[] is used to record new bios that will be issued to
underlying disks, however, in raid1_write_request(), r1_bio->bios[]
will set to the original bio temporarily. Meanwhile, if blocked rdev
is set, free_r1bio() will be called causing that all r1_bio->bios[]
to be freed:

raid1_write_request()
 r1_bio = alloc_r1bio(mddev, bio); -> r1_bio->bios[] is NULL
 for (i = 0;  i < disks; i++) -> for each rdev in conf
  // first rdev is normal
  r1_bio->bios[0] = bio; -> set to original bio
  // second rdev is blocked
  if (test_bit(Blocked, &rdev->flags))
   break

 if (blocked_rdev)
  free_r1bio()
   put_all_bios()
    bio_put(r1_bio->bios[0]) -> original bio is freed

Test scripts:

mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l1 -n4 /dev/sd[abcd] --assume-clean
fio -filename=/dev/md0 -ioengine=libaio -rw=write -bs=4k -numjobs=1 \
    -iodepth=128 -name=test -direct=1
echo blocked > /sys/block/md0/md/rd2/state

Test result:

BUG bio-264 (Not tainted): Object already free

Since that bios for underlying disks are not allocated yet, fix this
problem by using mempool_free() directly to free the r1_bio.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35979 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
