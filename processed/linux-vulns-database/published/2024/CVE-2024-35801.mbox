Subject: CVE-2024-35801: x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD

Commit 672365477ae8 ("x86/fpu: Update XFD state where required") and
commit 8bf26758ca96 ("x86/fpu: Add XFD state to fpstate") introduced a
per CPU variable xfd_state to keep the MSR_IA32_XFD value cached, in
order to avoid unnecessary writes to the MSR.

On CPU hotplug MSR_IA32_XFD is reset to the init_fpstate.xfd, which
wipes out any stale state. But the per CPU cached xfd value is not
reset, which brings them out of sync.

As a consequence a subsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to update
the MSR which in turn can result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernel
space, which crashes the kernel.

To fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state together
with MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35801 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
