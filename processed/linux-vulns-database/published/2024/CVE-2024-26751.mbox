Subject: CVE-2024-26751: ARM: ep93xx: Add terminator to gpiod_lookup_table

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARM: ep93xx: Add terminator to gpiod_lookup_table

Without the terminator, if a con_id is passed to gpio_find() that
does not exist in the lookup table the function will not stop looping
correctly, and eventually cause an oops.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26751 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
