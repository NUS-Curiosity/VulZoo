Subject: CVE-2024-57893: ALSA: seq: oss: Fix races at processing SysEx messages

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: seq: oss: Fix races at processing SysEx messages

OSS sequencer handles the SysEx messages split in 6 bytes packets, and
ALSA sequencer OSS layer tries to combine those.  It stores the data
in the internal buffer and this access is racy as of now, which may
lead to the out-of-bounds access.

As a temporary band-aid fix, introduce a mutex for serializing the
process of the SysEx message packets.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57893 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
