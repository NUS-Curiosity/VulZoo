Subject: CVE-2024-38603: drivers/perf: hisi: hns3: Actually use devm_add_action_or_reset()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/perf: hisi: hns3: Actually use devm_add_action_or_reset()

pci_alloc_irq_vectors() allocates an irq vector. When devm_add_action()
fails, the irq vector is not freed, which leads to a memory leak.

Replace the devm_add_action with devm_add_action_or_reset to ensure
the irq vector can be destroyed when it fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38603 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
