Subject: CVE-2024-38538: net: bridge: xmit: make sure we have at least eth header len bytes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bridge: xmit: make sure we have at least eth header len bytes

syzbot triggered an uninit value[1] error in bridge device's xmit path
by sending a short (less than ETH_HLEN bytes) skb. To fix it check if
we can actually pull that amount instead of assuming.

Tested with dropwatch:
 drop at: br_dev_xmit+0xb93/0x12d0 [bridge] (0xffffffffc06739b3)
 origin: software
 timestamp: Mon May 13 11:31:53 2024 778214037 nsec
 protocol: 0x88a8
 length: 2
 original length: 2
 drop reason: PKT_TOO_SMALL

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
