Subject: CVE-2024-46694: drm/amd/display: avoid using null object of framebuffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: avoid using null object of framebuffer

Instead of using state->fb->obj[0] directly, get object from framebuffer
by calling drm_gem_fb_get_obj() and return error code when object is
null to avoid using null object of framebuffer.

(cherry picked from commit 73dd0ad9e5dad53766ea3e631303430116f834b3)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46694 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
