Subject: CVE-2024-41049: filelock: fix potential use-after-free in posix_lock_inode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

filelock: fix potential use-after-free in posix_lock_inode

Light Hsieh reported a KASAN UAF warning in trace_posix_lock_inode().
The request pointer had been changed earlier to point to a lock entry
that was added to the inode's list. However, before the tracepoint could
fire, another task raced in and freed that lock.

Fix this by moving the tracepoint inside the spinlock, which should
ensure that this doesn't happen.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41049 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
