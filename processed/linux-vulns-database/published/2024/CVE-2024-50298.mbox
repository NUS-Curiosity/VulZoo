Subject: CVE-2024-50298: net: enetc: allocate vf_state during PF probes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: enetc: allocate vf_state during PF probes

In the previous implementation, vf_state is allocated memory only when VF
is enabled. However, net_device_ops::ndo_set_vf_mac() may be called before
VF is enabled to configure the MAC address of VF. If this is the case,
enetc_pf_set_vf_mac() will access vf_state, resulting in access to a null
pointer. The simplified error log is as follows.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ef0edfbe9eeed1fccad7cb705648af5222664944
