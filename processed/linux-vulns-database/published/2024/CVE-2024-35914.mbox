Subject: CVE-2024-35914: nfsd: Fix error cleanup path in nfsd_rename()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: Fix error cleanup path in nfsd_rename()

Commit a8b0026847b8 ("rename(): avoid a deadlock in the case of parents
having no common ancestor") added an error bail out path. However this
path does not drop the remount protection that has been acquired. Fix
the cleanup path to properly drop the remount protection.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
