Subject: CVE-2024-44948: x86/mtrr: Check if fixed MTRRs exist before saving them

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/mtrr: Check if fixed MTRRs exist before saving them

MTRRs have an obsolete fixed variant for fine grained caching control
of the 640K-1MB region that uses separate MSRs. This fixed variant has
a separate capability bit in the MTRR capability MSR.

So far all x86 CPUs which support MTRR have this separate bit set, so it
went unnoticed that mtrr_save_state() does not check the capability bit
before accessing the fixed MTRR MSRs.

Though on a CPU that does not support the fixed MTRR capability this
results in a #GP.  The #GP itself is harmless because the RDMSR fault is
handled gracefully, but results in a WARN_ON().

Add the missing capability check to prevent this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44948 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
