Subject: CVE-2024-43838: bpf: fix overflow check in adjust_jmp_off()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: fix overflow check in adjust_jmp_off()

adjust_jmp_off() incorrectly used the insn->imm field for all overflow check,
which is incorrect as that should only be done or the BPF_JMP32 | BPF_JA case,
not the general jump instruction case. Fix it by using insn->off for overflow
check in the general case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43838 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
