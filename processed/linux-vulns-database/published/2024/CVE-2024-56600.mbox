Subject: CVE-2024-56600: net: inet6: do not leave a dangling sk pointer in inet6_create()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: inet6: do not leave a dangling sk pointer in inet6_create()

sock_init_data() attaches the allocated sk pointer to the provided sock
object. If inet6_create() fails later, the sk object is released, but the
sock object retains the dangling sk pointer, which may cause use-after-free
later.

Clear the sock sk pointer on error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56600 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
