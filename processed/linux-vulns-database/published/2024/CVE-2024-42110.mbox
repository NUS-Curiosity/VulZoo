Subject: CVE-2024-42110: net: ntb_netdev: Move ntb_netdev_rx_handler() to call netif_rx() from __netif_rx()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ntb_netdev: Move ntb_netdev_rx_handler() to call netif_rx() from __netif_rx()

The following is emitted when using idxd (DSA) dmanegine as the data
mover for ntb_transport that ntb_netdev uses.

The cause is due to the idxd driver interrupt completion handler uses
threaded interrupt and the threaded handler is not hard or soft interrupt
context. However __netif_rx() can only be called from interrupt context.
Change the call to netif_rx() in order to allow completion via normal
context for dmaengine drivers that utilize threaded irq handling.

While the following commit changed from netif_rx() to __netif_rx(),
baebdf48c360 ("net: dev: Makes sure netif_rx() can be invoked in any context."),
the change should've been a noop instead. However, the code precedes this
fix should've been using netif_rx_ni() or netif_rx_any_context().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42110 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
