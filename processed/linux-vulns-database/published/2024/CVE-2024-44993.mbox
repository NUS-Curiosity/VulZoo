Subject: CVE-2024-44993: drm/v3d: Fix out-of-bounds read in `v3d_csd_job_run()`

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Fix out-of-bounds read in `v3d_csd_job_run()`

When enabling UBSAN on Raspberry Pi 5, we get the following warning:

[  387.894977] UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/gpu/drm/v3d/v3d_sched.c:320:3

This happens because the UAPI provides only seven configuration
registers and we are reading the eighth position of this u32 array.

Therefore, fix the out-of-bounds read in `v3d_csd_job_run()` by
accessing only seven positions on the '__u32 [7]' array. The eighth
register exists indeed on V3D 7.1, but it isn't currently used. That
being so, let's guarantee that it remains unused and add a note that it
could be set in a future patch.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44993 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d656b82c4b30cf12715e6cd129d3df808fde24a7
