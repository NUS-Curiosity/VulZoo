Subject: CVE-2024-47723: jfs: fix out-of-bounds in dbNextAG() and diAlloc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: fix out-of-bounds in dbNextAG() and diAlloc()

In dbNextAG() , there is no check for the case where bmp->db_numag is
greater or same than MAXAG due to a polluted image, which causes an
out-of-bounds. Therefore, a bounds check should be added in dbMount().

And in dbNextAG(), a check for the case where agpref is greater than
bmp->db_numag should be added, so an out-of-bounds exception should be
prevented.

Additionally, a check for the case where agno is greater or same than
MAXAG should be added in diAlloc() to prevent out-of-bounds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47723 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
