Subject: CVE-2024-50223: sched/numa: Fix the potential null pointer dereference in task_numa_work()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/numa: Fix the potential null pointer dereference in task_numa_work()

When running stress-ng-vm-segv test, we found a null pointer dereference
error in task_numa_work(). Here is the backtrace:

stress-ng-vm-segv in stress-ng is used to stress test the SIGSEGV error
handling function of the system, which tries to cause a SIGSEGV error on
return from unmapping the whole address space of the child process.

Normally this program will not cause kernel crashes. But before the
munmap system call returns to user mode, a potential task_numa_work()
for numa balancing could be added and executed. In this scenario, since the
child process has no vma after munmap, the vma_next() in task_numa_work()
will return a null pointer even if the vma iterator restarts from 0.

Recheck the vma pointer before dereferencing it in task_numa_work().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50223 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ade91f6e9848b370add44d89c976e070ccb492ef
