Subject: CVE-2024-27078: media: v4l2-tpg: fix some memleaks in tpg_alloc

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: v4l2-tpg: fix some memleaks in tpg_alloc

In tpg_alloc, resources should be deallocated in each and every
error-handling paths, since they are allocated in for statements.
Otherwise there would be memleaks because tpg_free is called only when
tpg_alloc return 0.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27078 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
