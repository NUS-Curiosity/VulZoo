Subject: CVE-2024-50058: serial: protect uart_port_dtr_rts() in uart_shutdown() too

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: protect uart_port_dtr_rts() in uart_shutdown() too

Commit af224ca2df29 (serial: core: Prevent unsafe uart port access, part
3) added few uport == NULL checks. It added one to uart_shutdown(), so
the commit assumes, uport can be NULL in there. But right after that
protection, there is an unprotected "uart_port_dtr_rts(uport, false);"
call. That is invoked only if HUPCL is set, so I assume that is the
reason why we do not see lots of these reports.

Or it cannot be NULL at this point at all for some reason :P.

Until the above is investigated, stay on the safe side and move this
dereference to the if too.

I got this inconsistency from Coverity under CID 1585130. Thanks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50058 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
