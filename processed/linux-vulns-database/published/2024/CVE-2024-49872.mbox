Subject: CVE-2024-49872: mm/gup: fix memfd_pin_folios alloc race panic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/gup: fix memfd_pin_folios alloc race panic

If memfd_pin_folios tries to create a hugetlb page, but someone else
already did, then folio gets the value -EEXIST here:

        folio = memfd_alloc_folio(memfd, start_idx);
        if (IS_ERR(folio)) {
                ret = PTR_ERR(folio);
                if (ret != -EEXIST)
                        goto err;

then on the next trip through the "while start_idx" loop we panic here:

        if (folio) {
                folio_put(folio);

To fix, set the folio to NULL on error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49872 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e28f39b359c0cfdcc011603e51187085a5f1e5e3
