Subject: CVE-2024-53128: sched/task_stack: fix object_is_on_stack() for KASAN tagged pointers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched/task_stack: fix object_is_on_stack() for KASAN tagged pointers

When CONFIG_KASAN_SW_TAGS and CONFIG_KASAN_STACK are enabled, the
object_is_on_stack() function may produce incorrect results due to the
presence of tags in the obj pointer, while the stack pointer does not have
tags.  This discrepancy can lead to incorrect stack object detection and
subsequently trigger warnings if CONFIG_DEBUG_OBJECTS is also enabled.

Example of the warning:

ODEBUG: object 3eff800082ea7bb0 is NOT on stack ffff800082ea0000, but annotated.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
