Subject: CVE-2024-50156: drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/msm: Avoid NULL dereference in msm_disp_state_print_regs()

If the allocation in msm_disp_state_dump_regs() failed then
`block->state` can be NULL. The msm_disp_state_print_regs() function
_does_ have code to try to handle it with:

  if (*reg)
    dump_addr = *reg;

...but since "dump_addr" is initialized to NULL the above is actually
a noop. The code then goes on to dereference `dump_addr`.

Make the function print "Registers not stored" when it sees a NULL to
solve this. Since we're touching the code, fix
msm_disp_state_print_regs() not to pointlessly take a double-pointer
and properly mark the pointer as `const`.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
