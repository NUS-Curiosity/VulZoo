Subject: CVE-2024-42283: net: nexthop: Initialize all fields in dumped nexthops

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: nexthop: Initialize all fields in dumped nexthops

struct nexthop_grp contains two reserved fields that are not initialized by
nla_put_nh_group(), and carry garbage. This can be observed e.g. with
strace (edited for clarity):

    # ip nexthop add id 1 dev lo
    # ip nexthop add id 101 group 1
    # strace -e recvmsg ip nexthop get id 101
    ...
    recvmsg(... [{nla_len=12, nla_type=NHA_GROUP},
                 [{id=1, weight=0, resvd1=0x69, resvd2=0x67}]] ...) = 52

The fields are reserved and therefore not currently used. But as they are, they
leak kernel memory, and the fact they are not just zero complicates repurposing
of the fields for new ends. Initialize the full structure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42283 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
