[Analysis]
gsm_msg on the tx_ctrl_list or tx_data_list of gsm_mux
can be freed by multi threads through ioctl,which leads
to the occurrence of uaf. Protect it by gsm tx lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50073 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
