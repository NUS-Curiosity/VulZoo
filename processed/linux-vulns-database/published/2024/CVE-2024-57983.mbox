Subject: CVE-2024-57983: mailbox: th1520: Fix memory corruption due to incorrect array size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mailbox: th1520: Fix memory corruption due to incorrect array size

The functions th1520_mbox_suspend_noirq and th1520_mbox_resume_noirq are
intended to save and restore the interrupt mask registers in the MBOX
ICU0. However, the array used to store these registers was incorrectly
sized, leading to memory corruption when accessing all four registers.

This commit corrects the array size to accommodate all four interrupt
mask registers, preventing memory corruption during suspend and resume
operations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57983 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
