Subject: CVE-2024-53187: io_uring: check for overflows in io_pin_pages

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: check for overflows in io_pin_pages

io_pin_pages()'s uaddr parameter came directly from the user and can be
garbage. Don't just add size to it as it can overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53187 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
