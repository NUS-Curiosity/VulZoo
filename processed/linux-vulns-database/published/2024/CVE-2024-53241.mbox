Subject: CVE-2024-53241: x86/xen: don't do PV iret hypercall through hypercall page

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/xen: don't do PV iret hypercall through hypercall page

Instead of jumping to the Xen hypercall page for doing the iret
hypercall, directly code the required sequence in xen-asm.S.

This is done in preparation of no longer using hypercall page at all,
as it has shown to cause problems with speculation mitigations.

This is part of XSA-466 / CVE-2024-53241.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53241 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
