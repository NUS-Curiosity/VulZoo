Subject: CVE-2024-40949: mm: shmem: fix getting incorrect lruvec when replacing a shmem folio

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: shmem: fix getting incorrect lruvec when replacing a shmem folio

When testing shmem swapin, I encountered the warning below on my machine. 
The reason is that replacing an old shmem folio with a new one causes
mem_cgroup_migrate() to clear the old folio's memcg data.  As a result,
the old folio cannot get the correct memcg's lruvec needed to remove
itself from the LRU list when it is being freed.  This could lead to
possible serious problems, such as LRU list crashes due to holding the
wrong LRU lock, and incorrect LRU statistics.

To fix this issue, we can fallback to use the mem_cgroup_replace_folio()
to replace the old shmem folio.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
