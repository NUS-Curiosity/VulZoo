Subject: CVE-2024-47733: netfs: Delete subtree of 'fs/netfs' when netfs module exits

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfs: Delete subtree of 'fs/netfs' when netfs module exits

In netfs_init() or fscache_proc_init(), we create dentry under 'fs/netfs',
but in netfs_exit(), we only delete the proc entry of 'fs/netfs' without
deleting its subtree. This triggers the following WARNING:

==================================================================
remove_proc_entry: removing non-empty directory 'fs/netfs', leaking at least 'requests'
WARNING: CPU: 4 PID: 566 at fs/proc/generic.c:717 remove_proc_entry+0x160/0x1c0
Modules linked in: netfs(-)
CPU: 4 UID: 0 PID: 566 Comm: rmmod Not tainted 6.11.0-rc3 #860
RIP: 0010:remove_proc_entry+0x160/0x1c0
Call Trace:

==================================================================

Therefore use remove_proc_subtree() instead of remove_proc_entry() to
fix the above problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47733 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/603f95cefbee06a31b03137b777f03e3c2163d72
