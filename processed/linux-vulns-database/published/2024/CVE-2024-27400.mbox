Subject: CVE-2024-27400: drm/amdgpu: once more fix the call oder in amdgpu_ttm_move() v2

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: once more fix the call oder in amdgpu_ttm_move() v2

This reverts drm/amdgpu: fix ftrace event amdgpu_bo_move always move
on same heap. The basic problem here is that after the move the old
location is simply not available any more.

Some fixes were suggested, but essentially we should call the move
notification before actually moving things because only this way we have
the correct order for DMA-buf and VM move notifications as well.

Also rework the statistic handling so that we don't update the eviction
counter before the move.

v2: add missing NULL check

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27400 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
