Subject: CVE-2024-36003: ice: fix LAG and VF lock dependency in ice_reset_vf()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix LAG and VF lock dependency in ice_reset_vf()

9f74a3dfcf83 ("ice: Fix VF Reset paths when interface in a failed over
aggregate"), the ice driver has acquired the LAG mutex in ice_reset_vf().
The commit placed this lock acquisition just prior to the acquisition of
the VF configuration lock.

If ice_reset_vf() acquires the configuration lock via the ICE_VF_RESET_LOCK
flag, this could deadlock with ice_vc_cfg_qs_msg() because it always
acquires the locks in the order of the VF configuration lock and then the
LAG mutex.

Lockdep reports this violation almost immediately on creating and then
removing 2 VF:

To avoid deadlock, we must acquire the LAG mutex only after acquiring the
VF configuration lock. Fix the ice_reset_vf() to acquire the LAG mutex only
after we either acquire or check that the VF configuration lock is held.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
