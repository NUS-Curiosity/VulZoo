Subject: CVE-2024-47698: drivers: media: dvb-frontends/rtl2832: fix an out-of-bounds write error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers: media: dvb-frontends/rtl2832: fix an out-of-bounds write error

Ensure index in rtl2832_pid_filter does not exceed 31 to prevent
out-of-bounds access.

dev->filters is a 32-bit value, so set_bit and clear_bit functions should
only operate on indices from 0 to 31. If index is 32, it will attempt to
access a non-existent 33rd bit, leading to out-of-bounds access.
Change the boundary check from index > 32 to index >= 32 to resolve this
issue.

[hverkuil: added fixes tag, rtl2830_pid_filter -> rtl2832_pid_filter in logmsg]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47698 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
