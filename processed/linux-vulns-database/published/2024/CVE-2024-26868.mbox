Subject: CVE-2024-26868: nfs: fix panic when nfs4_ff_layout_prepare_ds() fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfs: fix panic when nfs4_ff_layout_prepare_ds() fails

We've been seeing the following panic in production

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000065

Inspecting the core with drgn I was able to pull this

  >>> prog.crashed_thread().stack_trace()[0]
  #0 at 0xffffffffa079657a (ff_layout_cancel_io+0x3a/0x84) in ff_layout_cancel_io at fs/nfs/flexfilelayout/flexfilelayout.c:2021:27
  >>> prog.crashed_thread().stack_trace()[0]['idx']
  (u32)1
  >>> prog.crashed_thread().stack_trace()[0]['flseg'].mirror_array[1].mirror_ds
  (struct nfs4_ff_layout_ds *)0xffffffffffffffed

This is clear from the stack trace, we call nfs4_ff_layout_prepare_ds()
which could error out initializing the mirror_ds, and then we go to
clean it all up and our check is only for if (!mirror->mirror_ds).  This
is inconsistent with the rest of the users of mirror_ds, which have

  if (IS_ERR_OR_NULL(mirror_ds))

to keep from tripping over this exact scenario.  Fix this up in
ff_layout_cancel_io() to make sure we don't panic when we get an error.
I also spot checked all the other instances of checking mirror_ds and we
appear to be doing the correct checks everywhere, only unconditionally
dereferencing mirror_ds when we know it would be valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26868 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
