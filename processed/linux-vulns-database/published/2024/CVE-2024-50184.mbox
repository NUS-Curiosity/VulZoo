Subject: CVE-2024-50184: virtio_pmem: Check device status before requesting flush

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio_pmem: Check device status before requesting flush

If a pmem device is in a bad status, the driver side could wait for
host ack forever in virtio_pmem_flush(), causing the system to hang.

So add a status check in the beginning of virtio_pmem_flush() to return
early if the device is not activated.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50184 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
