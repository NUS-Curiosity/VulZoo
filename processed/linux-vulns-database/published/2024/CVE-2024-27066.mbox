Subject: CVE-2024-27066: virtio: packed: fix unmap leak for indirect desc table

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

virtio: packed: fix unmap leak for indirect desc table

When use_dma_api and premapped are true, then the do_unmap is false.

Because the do_unmap is false, vring_unmap_extra_packed is not called by
detach_buf_packed.

  if (unlikely(vq->do_unmap)) {
                curr = id;
                for (i = 0; i < state->num; i++) {
                        vring_unmap_extra_packed(vq,
                                                 &vq->packed.desc_extra[curr]);
                        curr = vq->packed.desc_extra[curr].next;
                }
  }

So the indirect desc table is not unmapped. This causes the unmap leak.

So here, we check vq->use_dma_api instead. Synchronously, dma info is
updated based on use_dma_api judgment

This bug does not occur, because no driver use the premapped with
indirect.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27066 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
