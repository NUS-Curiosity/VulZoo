Subject: CVE-2024-38607: macintosh/via-macii: Fix "BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

macintosh/via-macii: Fix "BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context"

The via-macii ADB driver calls request_irq() after disabling hard
interrupts. But disabling interrupts isn't necessary here because the
VIA shift register interrupt was masked during VIA1 initialization.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38607 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
