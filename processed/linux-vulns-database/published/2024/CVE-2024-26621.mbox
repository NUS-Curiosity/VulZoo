Subject: CVE-2024-26621: mm: huge_memory: don't force huge page alignment on 32 bit

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: huge_memory: don't force huge page alignment on 32 bit

commit efa7df3e3bb5 ("mm: align larger anonymous mappings on THP
boundaries") caused two issues [1] [2] reported on 32 bit system or compat
userspace.

It doesn't make too much sense to force huge page alignment on 32 bit
system due to the constrained virtual address space.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
