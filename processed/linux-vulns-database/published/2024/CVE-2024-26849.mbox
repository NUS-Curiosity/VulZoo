Subject: CVE-2024-26849: netlink: add nla be16/32 types to minlen array

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netlink: add nla be16/32 types to minlen array

BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in nla_validate_range_unsigned lib/nlattr.c:222 [inline]
BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in nla_validate_int_range lib/nlattr.c:336 [inline]
BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in validate_nla lib/nlattr.c:575 [inline]
BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in __nla_validate_parse+0x2e20/0x45c0 lib/nlattr.c:631
 nla_validate_range_unsigned lib/nlattr.c:222 [inline]
 nla_validate_int_range lib/nlattr.c:336 [inline]
 validate_nla lib/nlattr.c:575 [inline]
...

The message in question matches this policy:

 [NFTA_TARGET_REV]       = NLA_POLICY_MAX(NLA_BE32, 255),

but because NLA_BE32 size in minlen array is 0, the validation
code will read past the malformed (too small) attribute.

Note: Other attributes, e.g. BITFIELD32, SINT, UINT.. are also missing:
those likely should be added too.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26849 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
