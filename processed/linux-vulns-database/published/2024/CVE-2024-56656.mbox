Subject: CVE-2024-56656: bnxt_en: Fix aggregation ID mask to prevent oops on 5760X chips

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Fix aggregation ID mask to prevent oops on 5760X chips

The 5760X (P7) chip's HW GRO/LRO interface is very similar to that of
the previous generation (5750X or P5).  However, the aggregation ID
fields in the completion structures on P7 have been redefined from
16 bits to 12 bits.  The freed up 4 bits are redefined for part of the
metadata such as the VLAN ID.  The aggregation ID mask was not modified
when adding support for P7 chips.  Including the extra 4 bits for the
aggregation ID can potentially cause the driver to store or fetch the
packet header of GRO/LRO packets in the wrong TPA buffer.  It may hit
the BUG() condition in __skb_pull() because the SKB contains no valid
packet header:

Fix it by redefining the aggregation ID mask for P5_PLUS chips to be
12 bits.  This will work because the maximum aggregation ID is less
than 4096 on all P5_PLUS chips.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56656 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fe9274027697c69c1430dc7ee568f82b331ef972
