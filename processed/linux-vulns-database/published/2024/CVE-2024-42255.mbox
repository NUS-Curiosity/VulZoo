Subject: CVE-2024-42255: tpm: Use auth only after NULL check in tpm_buf_check_hmac_response()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tpm: Use auth only after NULL check in tpm_buf_check_hmac_response()

Dereference auth after NULL check in tpm_buf_check_hmac_response().
Otherwise, unless tpm2_sessions_init() was called, a call can cause NULL
dereference, when TCG_TPM2_HMAC is enabled.

[jarkko: adjusted the commit message.]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42255 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
