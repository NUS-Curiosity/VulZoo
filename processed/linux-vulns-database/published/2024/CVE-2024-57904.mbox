Subject: CVE-2024-57904: iio: adc: at91: call input_free_device() on allocated iio_dev

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: at91: call input_free_device() on allocated iio_dev

Current implementation of at91_ts_register() calls input_free_deivce()
on st->ts_input, however, the err label can be reached before the
allocated iio_dev is stored to st->ts_input. Thus call
input_free_device() on input instead of st->ts_input.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57904 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
