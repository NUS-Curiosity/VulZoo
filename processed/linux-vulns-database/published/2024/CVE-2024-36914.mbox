Subject: CVE-2024-36914: drm/amd/display: Skip on writeback when it's not applicable

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Skip on writeback when it's not applicable

[WHY]
dynamic memory safety error detector (KASAN) catches and generates error
messages "BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds" as writeback connector does not
support certain features which are not initialized.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
