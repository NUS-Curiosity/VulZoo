Subject: CVE-2024-39466: thermal/drivers/qcom/lmh: Check for SCM availability at probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal/drivers/qcom/lmh: Check for SCM availability at probe

Up until now, the necessary scm availability check has not been
performed, leading to possible null pointer dereferences (which did
happen for me on RB1).

Fix that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39466 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
