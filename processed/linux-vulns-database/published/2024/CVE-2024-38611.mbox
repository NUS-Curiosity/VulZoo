Subject: CVE-2024-38611: media: i2c: et8ek8: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: i2c: et8ek8: Don't strip remove function when driver is builtin

Using __exit for the remove function results in the remove callback
being discarded with CONFIG_VIDEO_ET8EK8=y. When such a device gets
unbound (e.g. using sysfs or hotplug), the driver is just removed
without the cleanup being performed. This results in resource leaks. Fix
it by compiling in the remove callback unconditionally.

This also fixes a W=1 modpost warning:

	WARNING: modpost: drivers/media/i2c/et8ek8/et8ek8: section mismatch in reference: et8ek8_i2c_driver+0x10 (section: .data) -> et8ek8_remove (section: .exit.text)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38611 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
