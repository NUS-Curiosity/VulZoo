Subject: CVE-2024-56697: drm/amdgpu: Fix the memory allocation issue in amdgpu_discovery_get_nps_info()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix the memory allocation issue in amdgpu_discovery_get_nps_info()

Fix two issues with memory allocation in amdgpu_discovery_get_nps_info()
for mem_ranges:

 - Add a check for allocation failure to avoid dereferencing a null
   pointer.

 - As suggested by Christophe, use kvcalloc() for memory allocation,
   which checks for multiplication overflow.

Additionally, assign the output parameters nps_type and range_cnt after
the kvcalloc() call to prevent modifying the output parameters in case
of an error return.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56697 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d14bea4e094871226ea69772d69dab8b7b5f4915
