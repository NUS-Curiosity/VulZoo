Subject: CVE-2024-42100: clk: sunxi-ng: common: Don't call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: sunxi-ng: common: Don't call hw_to_ccu_common on hw without common

In order to set the rate range of a hw sunxi_ccu_probe calls
hw_to_ccu_common() assuming all entries in desc->ccu_clks are contained
in a ccu_common struct. This assumption is incorrect and, in
consequence, causes invalid pointer de-references.

Remove the faulty call. Instead, add one more loop that iterates over
the ccu_clks and sets the rate range, if required.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42100 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
