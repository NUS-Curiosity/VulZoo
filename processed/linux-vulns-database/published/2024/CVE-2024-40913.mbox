Subject: CVE-2024-40913: cachefiles: defer exposing anon_fd until after copy_to_user() succeeds

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachefiles: defer exposing anon_fd until after copy_to_user() succeeds

After installing the anonymous fd, we can now see it in userland and close
it. However, at this point we may not have gotten the reference count of
the cache, but we will put it during colse fd, so this may cause a cache
UAF.

So grab the cache reference count before fd_install(). In addition, by
kernel convention, fd is taken over by the user land after fd_install(),
and the kernel should not call close_fd() after that, i.e., it should call
fd_install() after everything is ready, thus fd_install() is called after
copy_to_user() succeeds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40913 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
