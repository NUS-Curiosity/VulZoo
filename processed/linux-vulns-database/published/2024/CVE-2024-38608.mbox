Subject: CVE-2024-38608: net/mlx5e: Fix netif state handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix netif state handling

mlx5e_suspend cleans resources only if netif_device_present() returns
true. However, mlx5e_resume changes the state of netif, via
mlx5e_nic_enable, only if reg_state == NETREG_REGISTERED.
In the below case, the above leads to NULL-ptr Oops[1] and memory
leaks:

mlx5e_probe
 _mlx5e_resume
  mlx5e_attach_netdev
   mlx5e_nic_enable  <-- netdev not reg, not calling netif_device_attach()
  register_netdev <-- failed for some reason.
ERROR_FLOW:
 _mlx5e_suspend <-- netif_device_present return false, resources aren't freed :(

Hence, clean resources in this case as well.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en_main.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f7e6cfb864a53af71c5cc904f1cc22215d68f5c6
