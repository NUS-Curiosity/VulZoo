Subject: CVE-2024-36006: mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix incorrect list API usage

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix incorrect list API usage

Both the function that migrates all the chunks within a region and the
function that migrates all the entries within a chunk call
list_first_entry() on the respective lists without checking that the
lists are not empty. This is incorrect usage of the API, which leads to
the following warning [1].

Fix by returning if the lists are empty as there is nothing to migrate
in this case.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
