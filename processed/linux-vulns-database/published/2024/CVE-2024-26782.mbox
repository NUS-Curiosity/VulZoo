Subject: CVE-2024-26782: mptcp: fix double-free on socket dismantle

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix double-free on socket dismantle

when MPTCP server accepts an incoming connection, it clones its listener
socket. However, the pointer to 'inet_opt' for the new socket has the same
value as the original one: as a consequence, on program exit it's possible
to observe the following splat:

Something similar (a refcount underflow) happens with CALIPSO/IPv6. Fix
this by duplicating IP / IPv6 options after clone, so that
ip{,6}_sock_destruct() doesn't end up freeing the same memory area twice.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26782 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
