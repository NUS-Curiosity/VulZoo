Subject: CVE-2024-43821: scsi: lpfc: Fix a possible null pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Fix a possible null pointer dereference

In function lpfc_xcvr_data_show, the memory allocation with kmalloc might
fail, thereby making rdp_context a null pointer. In the following context
and functions that use this pointer, there are dereferencing operations,
leading to null pointer dereference.

To fix this issue, a null pointer check should be added. If it is null,
use scnprintf to notify the user and return len.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43821 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
