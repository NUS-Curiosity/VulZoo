Subject: CVE-2024-56662: acpi: nfit: vmalloc-out-of-bounds Read in acpi_nfit_ctl

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

acpi: nfit: vmalloc-out-of-bounds Read in acpi_nfit_ctl

Fix an issue detected by syzbot with KASAN:

BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in cmd_to_func drivers/acpi/nfit/
core.c:416 [inline]
BUG: KASAN: vmalloc-out-of-bounds in acpi_nfit_ctl+0x20e8/0x24a0
drivers/acpi/nfit/core.c:459

The issue occurs in cmd_to_func when the call_pkg->nd_reserved2
array is accessed without verifying that call_pkg points to a buffer
that is appropriately sized as a struct nd_cmd_pkg. This can lead
to out-of-bounds access and undefined behavior if the buffer does not
have sufficient space.

To address this, a check was added in acpi_nfit_ctl() to ensure that
buf is not NULL and that buf_len is less than sizeof(*call_pkg)
before accessing it. This ensures safe access to the members of
call_pkg, including the nd_reserved2 array.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56662 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
