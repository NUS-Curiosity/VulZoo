Subject: CVE-2024-49957: ocfs2: fix null-ptr-deref when journal load failed.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: fix null-ptr-deref when journal load failed.

During the mounting process, if journal_reset() fails because of too short
journal, then lead to jbd2_journal_load() fails with NULL j_sb_buffer. 
Subsequently, ocfs2_journal_shutdown() calls
jbd2_journal_flush()->jbd2_cleanup_journal_tail()->
__jbd2_update_log_tail()->jbd2_journal_update_sb_log_tail()
->lock_buffer(journal->j_sb_buffer), resulting in a null-pointer
dereference error.

To resolve this issue, we should check the JBD2_LOADED flag to ensure the
journal was properly loaded.  Additionally, use journal instead of
osb->journal directly to simplify the code.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49957 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
