Subject: CVE-2024-39464: media: v4l: async: Fix notifier list entry init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: v4l: async: Fix notifier list entry init

struct v4l2_async_notifier has several list_head members, but only
waiting_list and done_list are initialized. notifier_entry was kept
'zeroed' leading to an uninitialized list_head.
This results in a NULL-pointer dereference if csi2_async_register() fails,
e.g. node for remote endpoint is disabled, and returns -ENOTCONN.
The following calls to v4l2_async_nf_unregister() results in a NULL
pointer dereference.
Add the missing list head initializer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39464 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
