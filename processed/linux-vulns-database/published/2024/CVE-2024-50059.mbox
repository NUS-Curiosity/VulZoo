Subject: CVE-2024-50059: ntb: ntb_hw_switchtec: Fix use after free vulnerability in switchtec_ntb_remove due to race condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntb: ntb_hw_switchtec: Fix use after free vulnerability in switchtec_ntb_remove due to race condition

In the switchtec_ntb_add function, it can call switchtec_ntb_init_sndev
function, then &sndev->check_link_status_work is bound with
check_link_status_work. switchtec_ntb_link_notification may be called
to start the work.

If we remove the module which will call switchtec_ntb_remove to make
cleanup, it will free sndev through kfree(sndev), while the work
mentioned above will be used. The sequence of operations that may lead
to a UAF bug is as follows:

CPU0                                 CPU1

                        | check_link_status_work
switchtec_ntb_remove    |
kfree(sndev);           |
                        | if (sndev->link_force_down)
                        | // use sndev

Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding with
the cleanup in switchtec_ntb_remove.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50059 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
