Subject: CVE-2024-53210: s390/iucv: MSG_PEEK causes memory leak in iucv_sock_destruct()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/iucv: MSG_PEEK causes memory leak in iucv_sock_destruct()

Passing MSG_PEEK flag to skb_recv_datagram() increments skb refcount
(skb->users) and iucv_sock_recvmsg() does not decrement skb refcount
at exit.
This results in skb memory leak in skb_queue_purge() and WARN_ON in
iucv_sock_destruct() during socket close. To fix this decrease
skb refcount by one if MSG_PEEK is set in order to prevent memory
leak and WARN_ON.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
