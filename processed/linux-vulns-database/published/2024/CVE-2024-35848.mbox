Subject: CVE-2024-35848: eeprom: at24: fix memory corruption race condition

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

eeprom: at24: fix memory corruption race condition

If the eeprom is not accessible, an nvmem device will be registered, the
read will fail, and the device will be torn down. If another driver
accesses the nvmem device after the teardown, it will reference
invalid memory.

Move the failure point before registering the nvmem device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35848 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
