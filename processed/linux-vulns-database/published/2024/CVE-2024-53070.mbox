Subject: CVE-2024-53070: usb: dwc3: fix fault at system suspend if device was already runtime suspended

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: fix fault at system suspend if device was already runtime suspended

If the device was already runtime suspended then during system suspend
we cannot access the device registers else it will crash.

Also we cannot access any registers after dwc3_core_exit() on some
platforms so move the dwc3_enable_susphy() call to the top.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53070 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
