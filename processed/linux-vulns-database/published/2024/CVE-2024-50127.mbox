Subject: CVE-2024-50127: net: sched: fix use-after-free in taprio_change()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sched: fix use-after-free in taprio_change()

In 'taprio_change()', 'admin' pointer may become dangling due to sched
switch / removal caused by 'advance_sched()', and critical section
protected by 'q->current_entry_lock' is too small to prevent from such
a scenario (which causes use-after-free detected by KASAN). Fix this
by prefer 'rcu_replace_pointer()' over 'rcu_assign_pointer()' to update
'admin' immediately before an attempt to schedule freeing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50127 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
