Subject: CVE-2024-27015: netfilter: flowtable: incorrect pppoe tuple

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: flowtable: incorrect pppoe tuple

pppoe traffic reaching ingress path does not match the flowtable entry
because the pppoe header is expected to be at the network header offset.
This bug causes a mismatch in the flow table lookup, so pppoe packets
enter the classical forwarding path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27015 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
