Subject: CVE-2024-47700: ext4: check stripe size compatibility on remount as well

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: check stripe size compatibility on remount as well

We disable stripe size in __ext4_fill_super if it is not a multiple of
the cluster ratio however this check is missed when trying to remount.
This can leave us with cases where stripe < cluster_ratio after
remount:set making EXT4_B2C(sbi->s_stripe) become 0 that can cause some
unforeseen bugs like divide by 0.

Fix that by adding the check in remount path as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47700 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
