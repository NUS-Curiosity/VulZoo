Subject: CVE-2024-50148: Bluetooth: bnep: fix wild-memory-access in proto_unregister

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: bnep: fix wild-memory-access in proto_unregister

There's issue as follows:
  KASAN: maybe wild-memory-access in range [0xdead...108-0xdead...10f]
  CPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 2805 Comm: rmmod Tainted: G        W
  RIP: 0010:proto_unregister+0xee/0x400
  Call Trace:
   <TASK>
   __do_sys_delete_module+0x318/0x580
   do_syscall_64+0xc1/0x1d0
   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x77/0x7f

As bnep_init() ignore bnep_sock_init()'s return value, and bnep_sock_init()
will cleanup all resource. Then when remove bnep module will call
bnep_sock_cleanup() to cleanup sock's resource.
To solve above issue just return bnep_sock_init()'s return value in
bnep_exit().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50148 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
