Subject: CVE-2024-35854: mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix possible use-after-free during rehash

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix possible use-after-free during rehash

The rehash delayed work migrates filters from one region to another
according to the number of available credits.

The migrated from region is destroyed at the end of the work if the
number of credits is non-negative as the assumption is that this is
indicative of migration being complete. This assumption is incorrect as
a non-negative number of credits can also be the result of a failed
migration.

The destruction of a region that still has filters referencing it can
result in a use-after-free [1].

Fix by not destroying the region if migration failed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
