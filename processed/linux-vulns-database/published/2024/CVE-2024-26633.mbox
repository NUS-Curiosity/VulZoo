Subject: CVE-2024-26633: ip6_tunnel: fix NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT handling in ip6_tnl_parse_tlv_enc_lim()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ip6_tunnel: fix NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT handling in ip6_tnl_parse_tlv_enc_lim()

syzbot pointed out [1] that NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT handling is broken.

Reading frag_off can only be done if we pulled enough bytes
to skb->head. Currently we might access garbage.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
