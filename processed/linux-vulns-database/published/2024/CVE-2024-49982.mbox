Subject: CVE-2024-49982: aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in more places

For fixing CVE-2023-6270, f98364e92662 ("aoe: fix the potential
use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts") makes tx() calling dev_put()
instead of doing in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). It avoids that the tx() runs
into use-after-free.

Then Nicolai Stange found more places in aoe have potential use-after-free
problem with tx(). e.g. revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(), probe()
and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). Those functions also use aoenet_xmit() to push
packet to tx queue. So they should also use dev_hold() to increase the
refcnt of skb->dev.

On the other hand, moving dev_put() to tx() causes that the refcnt of
skb->dev be reduced to a negative value, because corresponding
dev_hold() are not called in revalidate(), aoecmd_ata_rw(), resend(),
probe(), and aoecmd_cfg_rsp(). This patch fixed this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49982 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
