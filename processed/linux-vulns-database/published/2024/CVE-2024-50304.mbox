Subject: CVE-2024-50304: ipv4: ip_tunnel: Fix suspicious RCU usage warning in ip_tunnel_find()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv4: ip_tunnel: Fix suspicious RCU usage warning in ip_tunnel_find()

The per-netns IP tunnel hash table is protected by the RTNL mutex and
ip_tunnel_find() is only called from the control path where the mutex is
taken.

Add a lockdep expression to hlist_for_each_entry_rcu() in
ip_tunnel_find() in order to validate that the mutex is held and to
silence the suspicious RCU usage warning [1].

[1]
WARNING: suspicious RCU usage
6.12.0-rc3-custom-gd95d9a31aceb #139 Not tainted
-----------------------------

other info that might help us debug this:

rcu_scheduler_active = 2, debug_locks = 1

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
