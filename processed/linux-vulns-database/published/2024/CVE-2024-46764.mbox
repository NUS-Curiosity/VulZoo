Subject: CVE-2024-46764: bpf: add check for invalid name in btf_name_valid_section()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: add check for invalid name in btf_name_valid_section()

If the length of the name string is 1 and the value of name[0] is NULL
byte, an OOB vulnerability occurs in btf_name_valid_section() and the
return value is true, so the invalid name passes the check.

To solve this, you need to check if the first position is NULL byte and
if the first character is printable.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46764 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
