Subject: CVE-2024-53224: RDMA/mlx5: Move events notifier registration to be after device registration

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Move events notifier registration to be after device registration

Move pkey change work initialization and cleanup from device resources
stage to notifier stage, since this is the stage which handles this work
events.

Fix a race between the device deregistration and pkey change work by moving
MLX5_IB_STAGE_DEVICE_NOTIFIER to be after MLX5_IB_STAGE_IB_REG in order to
ensure that the notifier is deregistered before the device during cleanup.
Which ensures there are no works that are being executed after the
device has already unregistered which can cause the panic below.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
