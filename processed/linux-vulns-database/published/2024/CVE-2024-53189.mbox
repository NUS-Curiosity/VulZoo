Subject: CVE-2024-53189: wifi: nl80211: fix bounds checker error in nl80211_parse_sched_scan

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: nl80211: fix bounds checker error in nl80211_parse_sched_scan

The channels array in the cfg80211_scan_request has a __counted_by
attribute attached to it, which points to the n_channels variable. This
attribute is used in bounds checking, and if it is not set before the
array is filled, then the bounds sanitizer will issue a warning or a
kernel panic if CONFIG_UBSAN_TRAP is set.

This patch sets the size of allocated memory as the initial value for
n_channels. It is updated with the actual number of added elements after
the array is filled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53189 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d4ef643ea78c59c22546046c25dc6e7206267672
