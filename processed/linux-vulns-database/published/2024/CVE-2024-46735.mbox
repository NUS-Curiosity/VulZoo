Subject: CVE-2024-46735: ublk_drv: fix NULL pointer dereference in ublk_ctrl_start_recovery()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk_drv: fix NULL pointer dereference in ublk_ctrl_start_recovery()

When two UBLK_CMD_START_USER_RECOVERY commands are submitted, the
first one sets 'ubq->ubq_daemon' to NULL, and the second one triggers
WARN in ublk_queue_reinit() and subsequently a NULL pointer dereference
issue.

Fix it by adding the check in ublk_ctrl_start_recovery() and return
immediately in case of zero 'ub->nr_queues_ready'.

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000028
  RIP: 0010:ublk_ctrl_start_recovery.constprop.0+0x82/0x180

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
