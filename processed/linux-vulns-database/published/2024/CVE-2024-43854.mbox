Subject: CVE-2024-43854: block: initialize integrity buffer to zero before writing it to media

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: initialize integrity buffer to zero before writing it to media

Metadata added by bio_integrity_prep is using plain kmalloc, which leads
to random kernel memory being written media.  For PI metadata this is
limited to the app tag that isn't used by kernel generated metadata,
but for non-PI metadata the entire buffer leaks kernel memory.

Fix this by adding the __GFP_ZERO flag to allocations for writes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43854 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
