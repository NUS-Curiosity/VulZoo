Subject: CVE-2024-58001: ocfs2: handle a symlink read error correctly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: handle a symlink read error correctly

Patch series "Convert ocfs2 to use folios".

Mark did a conversion of ocfs2 to use folios and sent it to me as a
giant patch for review ;-)

So I've redone it as individual patches, and credited Mark for the patches
where his code is substantially the same.  It's not a bad way to do it;
his patch had some bugs and my patches had some bugs.  Hopefully all our
bugs were different from each other.  And hopefully Mark likes all the
changes I made to his code!


This patch (of 23):

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
