Subject: CVE-2024-53120: net/mlx5e: CT: Fix null-ptr-deref in add rule err flow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: CT: Fix null-ptr-deref in add rule err flow

In error flow of mlx5_tc_ct_entry_add_rule(), in case ct_rule_add()
callback returns error, zone_rule->attr is used uninitiated. Fix it to
use attr which has the needed pointer value.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
