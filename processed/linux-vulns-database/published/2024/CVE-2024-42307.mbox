Subject: CVE-2024-42307: cifs: fix potential null pointer use in destroy_workqueue in init_cifs error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix potential null pointer use in destroy_workqueue in init_cifs error path

Dan Carpenter reported a Smack static checker warning:
   fs/smb/client/cifsfs.c:1981 init_cifs()
   error: we previously assumed 'serverclose_wq' could be null (see line 1895)

The patch which introduced the serverclose workqueue used the wrong
oredering in error paths in init_cifs() for freeing it on errors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42307 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
