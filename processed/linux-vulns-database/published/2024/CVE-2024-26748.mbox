Subject: CVE-2024-26748: usb: cdns3: fix memory double free when handle zero packet

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: cdns3: fix memory double free when handle zero packet

829  if (request->complete) {
830          spin_unlock(&priv_dev->lock);
831          usb_gadget_giveback_request(&priv_ep->endpoint,
832                                    request);
833          spin_lock(&priv_dev->lock);
834  }
835
836  if (request->buf == priv_dev->zlp_buf)
837      cdns3_gadget_ep_free_request(&priv_ep->endpoint, request);

Driver append an additional zero packet request when queue a packet, which
length mod max packet size is 0. When transfer complete, run to line 831,
usb_gadget_giveback_request() will free this requestion. 836 condition is
true, so cdns3_gadget_ep_free_request() free this request again.

Log:

[ 1920.140696][  T150] BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free read in cdns3_gadget_giveback+0x134/0x2c0 [cdns3]
[ 1920.140696][  T150]
[ 1920.151837][  T150] Use-after-free read at 0x000000003d1cd10b (in kfence-#36):
[ 1920.159082][  T150]  cdns3_gadget_giveback+0x134/0x2c0 [cdns3]
[ 1920.164988][  T150]  cdns3_transfer_completed+0x438/0x5f8 [cdns3]

Add check at line 829, skip call usb_gadget_giveback_request() if it is
additional zero length packet request. Needn't call
usb_gadget_giveback_request() because it is allocated in this driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26748 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
