Subject: CVE-2024-39481: media: mc: Fix graph walk in media_pipeline_start

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: mc: Fix graph walk in media_pipeline_start

The graph walk tries to follow all links, even if they are not between
pads. This causes a crash with, e.g. a MEDIA_LNK_FL_ANCILLARY_LINK link.

Fix this by allowing the walk to proceed only for MEDIA_LNK_FL_DATA_LINK
links.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39481 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
