Subject: CVE-2024-36979: net: bridge: mst: fix vlan use-after-free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bridge: mst: fix vlan use-after-free

syzbot reported a suspicious rcu usage[1] in bridge's mst code. While
fixing it I noticed that nothing prevents a vlan to be freed while
walking the list from the same path (br forward delay timer). Fix the rcu
usage and also make sure we are not accessing freed memory by making
br_mst_vlan_set_state use rcu read lock.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
