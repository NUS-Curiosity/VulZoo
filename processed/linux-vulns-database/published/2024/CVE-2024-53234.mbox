Subject: CVE-2024-53234: erofs: handle NONHEAD !delta[1] lclusters gracefully

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: handle NONHEAD !delta[1] lclusters gracefully

syzbot reported a WARNING in iomap_iter_done:
 iomap_fiemap+0x73b/0x9b0 fs/iomap/fiemap.c:80
 ioctl_fiemap fs/ioctl.c:220 [inline]

Generally, NONHEAD lclusters won't have delta[1]==0, except for crafted
images and filesystems created by pre-1.0 mkfs versions.

Previously, it would immediately bail out if delta[1]==0, which led to
inadequate decompressed lengths (thus FIEMAP is impacted).  Treat it as
delta[1]=1 to work around these legacy mkfs versions.

`lclusterbits > 14` is illegal for compact indexes, error out too.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53234 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
