Subject: CVE-2024-50268: usb: typec: fix potential out of bounds in ucsi_ccg_update_set_new_cam_cmd()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: fix potential out of bounds in ucsi_ccg_update_set_new_cam_cmd()

The "*cmd" variable can be controlled by the user via debugfs.  That means
"new_cam" can be as high as 255 while the size of the uc->updated[] array
is UCSI_MAX_ALTMODES (30).

The call tree is:
ucsi_cmd() // val comes from simple_attr_write_xsigned()
-> ucsi_send_command()
   -> ucsi_send_command_common()
      -> ucsi_run_command() // calls ucsi->ops->sync_control()
         -> ucsi_ccg_sync_control()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50268 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
