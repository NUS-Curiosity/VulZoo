Subject: CVE-2024-53165: sh: intc: Fix use-after-free bug in register_intc_controller()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sh: intc: Fix use-after-free bug in register_intc_controller()

In the error handling for this function, d is freed without ever
removing it from intc_list which would lead to a use after free.
To fix this, let's only add it to the list after everything has
succeeded.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53165 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
