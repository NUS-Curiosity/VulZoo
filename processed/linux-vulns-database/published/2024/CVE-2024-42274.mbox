Subject: CVE-2024-42274: Revert "ALSA: firewire-lib: operate for period elapse event in process context"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Revert "ALSA: firewire-lib: operate for period elapse event in process context"

Commit 7ba5ca32fe6e ("ALSA: firewire-lib: operate for period elapse event
in process context") removed the process context workqueue from
amdtp_domain_stream_pcm_pointer() and update_pcm_pointers() to remove
its overhead.

With RME Fireface 800, this lead to a regression since
Kernels 5.14.0, causing an AB/BA deadlock competition for the
substream lock with eventual system freeze under ALSA operation:

thread 0:
    * (lock A) acquire substream lock by
	snd_pcm_stream_lock_irq() in
	snd_pcm_status64()
    * (lock B) wait for tasklet to finish by calling
    	tasklet_unlock_spin_wait() in
	tasklet_disable_in_atomic() in
	ohci_flush_iso_completions() of ohci.c

thread 1:
    * (lock B) enter tasklet
    * (lock A) attempt to acquire substream lock,
    	waiting for it to be released:
	snd_pcm_stream_lock_irqsave() in
    	snd_pcm_period_elapsed() in
	update_pcm_pointers() in
	process_ctx_payloads() in
	process_rx_packets() of amdtp-stream.c

? tasklet_unlock_spin_wait
 </NMI>
 <TASK>
ohci_flush_iso_completions firewire_ohci
amdtp_domain_stream_pcm_pointer snd_firewire_lib
snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0 snd_pcm
snd_pcm_status64 snd_pcm

? native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath

snd_pcm_period_elapsed snd_pcm
process_rx_packets snd_firewire_lib
irq_target_callback snd_firewire_lib

context_tasklet firewire_ohci

Restore the process context work queue to prevent deadlock
AB/BA deadlock competition for ALSA substream lock of
snd_pcm_stream_lock_irq() in snd_pcm_status64()
and snd_pcm_stream_lock_irqsave() in snd_pcm_period_elapsed().

revert commit 7ba5ca32fe6e ("ALSA: firewire-lib: operate for period
elapse event in process context")

Replace inline description to prevent future deadlock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42274 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
