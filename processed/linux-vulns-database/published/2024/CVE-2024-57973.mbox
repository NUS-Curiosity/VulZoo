Subject: CVE-2024-57973: rdma/cxgb4: Prevent potential integer overflow on 32bit

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rdma/cxgb4: Prevent potential integer overflow on 32bit

The "gl->tot_len" variable is controlled by the user.  It comes from
process_responses().  On 32bit systems, the "gl->tot_len + sizeof(struct
cpl_pass_accept_req) + sizeof(struct rss_header)" addition could have an
integer wrapping bug.  Use size_add() to prevent this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57973 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
