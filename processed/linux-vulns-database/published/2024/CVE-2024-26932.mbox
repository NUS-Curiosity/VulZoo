Subject: CVE-2024-26932: usb: typec: tcpm: fix double-free issue in tcpm_port_unregister_pd()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: tcpm: fix double-free issue in tcpm_port_unregister_pd()

When unregister pd capabilitie in tcpm, KASAN will capture below double
-free issue. The root cause is the same capabilitiy will be kfreed twice,
the first time is kfreed by pd_capabilities_release() and the second time
is explicitly kfreed by tcpm_port_unregister_pd().

To fix the issue, this will remove kree() from tcpm_port_unregister_pd().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26932 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
