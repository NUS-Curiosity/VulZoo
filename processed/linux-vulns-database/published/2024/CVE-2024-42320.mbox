Subject: CVE-2024-42320: s390/dasd: fix error checks in dasd_copy_pair_store()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/dasd: fix error checks in dasd_copy_pair_store()

dasd_add_busid() can return an error via ERR_PTR() if an allocation
fails. However, two callsites in dasd_copy_pair_store() do not check
the result, potentially resulting in a NULL pointer dereference. Fix
this by checking the result with IS_ERR() and returning the error up
the stack.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42320 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
