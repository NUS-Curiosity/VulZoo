Subject: CVE-2024-35841: net: tls, fix WARNIING in __sk_msg_free

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: tls, fix WARNIING in __sk_msg_free

A splice with MSG_SPLICE_PAGES will cause tls code to use the
tls_sw_sendmsg_splice path in the TLS sendmsg code to move the user
provided pages from the msg into the msg_pl. This will loop over the
msg until msg_pl is full, checked by sk_msg_full(msg_pl). The user
can also set the MORE flag to hint stack to delay sending until receiving
more pages and ideally a full buffer.

If the user adds more pages to the msg than can fit in the msg_pl
scatterlist (MAX_MSG_FRAGS) we should ignore the MORE flag and send
the buffer anyways.

What actually happens though is we abort the msg to msg_pl scatterlist
setup and then because we forget to set 'full record' indicating we
can no longer consume data without a send we fallthrough to the 'continue'
path which will check if msg_data_left(msg) has more bytes to send and
then attempts to fit them in the already full msg_pl. Then next
iteration of sender doing send will encounter a full msg_pl and throw
the warning in the syzbot report.

To fix simply check if we have a full_record in splice code path and
if not send the msg regardless of MORE flag.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35841 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
