Subject: CVE-2024-42247: wireguard: allowedips: avoid unaligned 64-bit memory accesses

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wireguard: allowedips: avoid unaligned 64-bit memory accesses

On the parisc platform, the kernel issues kernel warnings because
swap_endian() tries to load a 128-bit IPv6 address from an unaligned
memory location:

 Kernel: unaligned access to 0x55f4688c in wg_allowedips_insert_v6+0x2c/0x80 [wireguard] (iir 0xf3010df)
 Kernel: unaligned access to 0x55f46884 in wg_allowedips_insert_v6+0x38/0x80 [wireguard] (iir 0xf2010dc)

Avoid such unaligned memory accesses by instead using the
get_unaligned_be64() helper macro.

[Jason: replace src[8] in original patch with src+8]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42247 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
