Subject: CVE-2024-36936: efi/unaccepted: touch soft lockup during memory accept

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

efi/unaccepted: touch soft lockup during memory accept

Commit 50e782a86c98 ("efi/unaccepted: Fix soft lockups caused by
parallel memory acceptance") has released the spinlock so other CPUs can
do memory acceptance in parallel and not triggers softlockup on other
CPUs.

However the softlock up was intermittent shown up if the memory of the
TD guest is large, and the timeout of softlockup is set to 1 second:

 RIP: 0010:_raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore
 Call Trace:
 ? __hrtimer_run_queues

When the local irq is enabled at the end of accept_memory(), the
softlockup detects that the watchdog on single CPU has not been fed for
a while. That is to say, even other CPUs will not be blocked by
spinlock, the current CPU might be stunk with local irq disabled for a
while, which hurts not only nmi watchdog but also softlockup.

Chao Gao pointed out that the memory accept could be time costly and
there was similar report before. Thus to avoid any softlocup detection
during this stage, give the softlockup a flag to skip the timeout check
at the end of accept_memory(), by invoking touch_softlockup_watchdog().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36936 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e115c1b5de55a105c75aba8eb08301c075fa4ef4
