Subject: CVE-2024-43865: s390/fpu: Re-add exception handling in load_fpu_state()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/fpu: Re-add exception handling in load_fpu_state()

With the recent rewrite of the fpu code exception handling for the
lfpc instruction within load_fpu_state() was erroneously removed.

Add it again to prevent that loading invalid floating point register
values cause an unhandled specification exception.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43865 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/494b14138201f07343e5488db6360c828fcc8cf6
