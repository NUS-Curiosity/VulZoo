Subject: CVE-2024-50097: net: fec: don't save PTP state if PTP is unsupported

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: fec: don't save PTP state if PTP is unsupported

Some platforms (such as i.MX25 and i.MX27) do not support PTP, so on
these platforms fec_ptp_init() is not called and the related members
in fep are not initialized. However, fec_ptp_save_state() is called
unconditionally, which causes the kernel to panic. Therefore, add a
condition so that fec_ptp_save_state() is not called if PTP is not
supported.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50097 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
