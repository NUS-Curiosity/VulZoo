Subject: CVE-2024-27009: s390/cio: fix race condition during online processing

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/cio: fix race condition during online processing

A race condition exists in ccw_device_set_online() that can cause the
online process to fail, leaving the affected device in an inconsistent
state. As a result, subsequent attempts to set that device online fail
with return code ENODEV.

The problem occurs when a path verification request arrives after
a wait for final device state completed, but before the result state
is evaluated.

Fix this by ensuring that the CCW-device lock is held between
determining final state and checking result state.

Note that since:

commit 2297791c92d0 ("s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers")

path verification requests are much more likely to occur during boot,
resulting in an increased chance of this race condition occurring.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27009 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
