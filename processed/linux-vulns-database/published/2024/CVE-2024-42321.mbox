Subject: CVE-2024-42321: net: flow_dissector: use DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: flow_dissector: use DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE

The following splat is easy to reproduce upstream as well as in -stable
kernels. Florian Westphal provided the following commit:

  d1dab4f71d37 ("net: add and use __skb_get_hash_symmetric_net")

but this complementary fix has been also suggested by Willem de Bruijn
and it can be easily backported to -stable kernel which consists in
using DEBUG_NET_WARN_ON_ONCE instead to silence the following splat
given __skb_get_hash() is used by the nftables tracing infrastructure to
to identify packets in traces.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
