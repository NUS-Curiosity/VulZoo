Subject: CVE-2024-46768: hwmon: (hp-wmi-sensors) Check if WMI event data exists

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (hp-wmi-sensors) Check if WMI event data exists

The BIOS can choose to return no event data in response to a
WMI event, so the ACPI object passed to the WMI notify handler
can be NULL.

Check for such a situation and ignore the event in such a case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46768 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
