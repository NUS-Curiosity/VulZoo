Subject: CVE-2024-57887: drm: adv7511: Fix use-after-free in adv7533_attach_dsi()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm: adv7511: Fix use-after-free in adv7533_attach_dsi()

The host_node pointer was assigned and freed in adv7533_parse_dt(), and
later, adv7533_attach_dsi() uses the same. Fix this use-after-free issue
byÂ dropping of_node_put() in adv7533_parse_dt() and calling of_node_put()
in error path of probe() and also in the remove().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57887 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
