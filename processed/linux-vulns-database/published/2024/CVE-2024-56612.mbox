Subject: CVE-2024-56612: mm/gup: handle NULL pages in unpin_user_pages()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/gup: handle NULL pages in unpin_user_pages()

The recent addition of "pofs" (pages or folios) handling to gup has a
flaw: it assumes that unpin_user_pages() handles NULL pages in the pages**
array.  That's not the case, as I discovered when I ran on a new
configuration on my test machine.

Fix this by skipping NULL pages in unpin_user_pages(), just like
unpin_folios() already does.

Details: when booting on x86 with "numa=fake=2 movablecore=4G" on Linux
6.12, and running this:

    tools/testing/selftests/mm/gup_longterm

...I get the following crash:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000008
RIP: 0010:sanity_check_pinned_pages+0x3a/0x2d0

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/69d319450d1c651f3b05cd820ff285fdd810c032
