Subject: CVE-2024-46717: net/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix incorrect page release

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: SHAMPO, Fix incorrect page release

Under the following conditions:
1) No skb created yet
2) header_size == 0 (no SHAMPO header)
3) header_index + 1 % MLX5E_SHAMPO_WQ_HEADER_PER_PAGE == 0 (this is the
   last page fragment of a SHAMPO header page)

a new skb is formed with a page that is NOT a SHAMPO header page (it
is a regular data page). Further down in the same function
(mlx5e_handle_rx_cqe_mpwrq_shampo()), a SHAMPO header page from
header_index is released. This is wrong and it leads to SHAMPO header
pages being released more than once.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46717 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
