Subject: CVE-2024-46701: libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir

After we switch tmpfs dir operations from simple_dir_operations to
simple_offset_dir_operations, every rename happened will fill new dentry
to dest dir's maple tree(&SHMEM_I(inode)->dir_offsets->mt) with a free
key starting with octx->newx_offset, and then set newx_offset equals to
free key + 1. This will lead to infinite readdir combine with rename
happened at the same time, which fail generic/736 in xfstests(detail show
as below).

1. create 5000 files(1 2 3...) under one dir
2. call readdir(man 3 readdir) once, and get one entry
3. rename(entry, "TEMPFILE"), then rename("TEMPFILE", entry)
4. loop 2~3, until readdir return nothing or we loop too many
   times(tmpfs break test with the second condition)

We choose the same logic what commit 9b378f6ad48cf ("btrfs: fix infinite
directory reads") to fix it, record the last_index when we open dir, and
do not emit the entry which index >= last_index. The file->private_data
now used in offset dir can use directly to do this, and we also update
the last_index when we llseek the dir file.

[brauner: only update last_index after seek when offset is zero like Jan suggested]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46701 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/308b4fc2403b335894592ee9dc212a5e58bb309f
