Subject: CVE-2024-36929: net: core: reject skb_copy(_expand) for fraglist GSO skbs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: core: reject skb_copy(_expand) for fraglist GSO skbs

SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST skbs must not be linearized, otherwise they become
invalid. Return NULL if such an skb is passed to skb_copy or
skb_copy_expand, in order to prevent a crash on a potential later
call to skb_gso_segment.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36929 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
