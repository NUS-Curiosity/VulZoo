Subject: CVE-2024-53225: iommu/tegra241-cmdqv: Fix alignment failure at max_n_shift

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/tegra241-cmdqv: Fix alignment failure at max_n_shift

When configuring a kernel with PAGE_SIZE=4KB, depending on its setting of
CONFIG_CMA_ALIGNMENT, VCMDQ_LOG2SIZE_MAX=19 could fail the alignment test
and trigger a WARN_ON:
    WARNING: at drivers/iommu/arm/arm-smmu-v3/arm-smmu-v3.c:3646
    Call trace:
     arm_smmu_init_one_queue+0x15c/0x210
     tegra241_cmdqv_init_structures+0x114/0x338
     arm_smmu_device_probe+0xb48/0x1d90

Fix it by capping max_n_shift to CMDQ_MAX_SZ_SHIFT as SMMUv3 CMDQ does.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53225 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/85a1d70b86dbcb84a68e7e4942a5181276945988
