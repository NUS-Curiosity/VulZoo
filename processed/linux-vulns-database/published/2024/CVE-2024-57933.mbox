Subject: CVE-2024-57933: gve: guard XSK operations on the existence of queues

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gve: guard XSK operations on the existence of queues

This patch predicates the enabling and disabling of XSK pools on the
existence of queues. As it stands, if the interface is down, disabling
or enabling XSK pools would result in a crash, as the RX queue pointer
would be NULL. XSK pool registration will occur as part of the next
interface up.

Similarly, xsk_wakeup needs be guarded against queues disappearing
while the function is executing, so a check against the
GVE_PRIV_FLAGS_NAPI_ENABLED flag is added to synchronize with the
disabling of the bit and the synchronize_net() in gve_turndown.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57933 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
