Subject: CVE-2024-50027: thermal: core: Free tzp copy along with the thermal zone

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: core: Free tzp copy along with the thermal zone

The object pointed to by tz->tzp may still be accessed after being
freed in thermal_zone_device_unregister(), so move the freeing of it
to the point after the removal completion has been completed at which
it cannot be accessed any more.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50027 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
