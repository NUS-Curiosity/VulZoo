Subject: CVE-2024-58069: rtc: pcf85063: fix potential OOB write in PCF85063 NVMEM read

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rtc: pcf85063: fix potential OOB write in PCF85063 NVMEM read

The nvmem interface supports variable buffer sizes, while the regmap
interface operates with fixed-size storage. If an nvmem client uses a
buffer size less than 4 bytes, regmap_read will write out of bounds
as it expects the buffer to point at an unsigned int.

Fix this by using an intermediary unsigned int to hold the value.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58069 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
