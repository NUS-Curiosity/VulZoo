Subject: CVE-2024-35901: net: mana: Fix Rx DMA datasize and skb_over_panic

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mana: Fix Rx DMA datasize and skb_over_panic

mana_get_rxbuf_cfg() aligns the RX buffer's DMA datasize to be
multiple of 64. So a packet slightly bigger than mtu+14, say 1536,
can be received and cause skb_over_panic.

Sample dmesg:
[ 5325.237162] skbuff: skb_over_panic: text:ffffffffc043277a len:1536 put:1536 head:ff1100018b517000 data:ff1100018b517100 tail:0x700 end:0x6ea dev:<NULL>

[ 5325.326328]  net_rx_action+0x12e/0x280

As discussed internally, this alignment is not necessary. To fix
this bug, remove it from the code. So oversized packets will be
marked as CQE_RX_TRUNCATED by NIC, and dropped.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35901 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
