Subject: CVE-2024-40906: net/mlx5: Always stop health timer during driver removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Always stop health timer during driver removal

Currently, if teardown_hca fails to execute during driver removal, mlx5
does not stop the health timer. Afterwards, mlx5 continue with driver
teardown. This may lead to a UAF bug, which results in page fault
Oops[1], since the health timer invokes after resources were freed.

Hence, stop the health monitor even if teardown_hca fails.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
