Subject: CVE-2024-38588: ftrace: Fix possible use-after-free issue in ftrace_location()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftrace: Fix possible use-after-free issue in ftrace_location()

KASAN reports a bug:

  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in ftrace_location+0x90/0x120
  Read of size 8 at addr ffff888141d40010 by task insmod/424

   entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x71/0x79

The root cause is that, in lookup_rec(), ftrace record of some address
is being searched in ftrace pages of some module, but those ftrace pages
at the same time is being freed in ftrace_release_mod() as the
corresponding module is being deleted:

           CPU1                       |      CPU2
  register_kprobes() {                | delete_module() {
    check_kprobe_address_safe() {     |
      arch_check_ftrace_location() {  |
        ftrace_location() {           |
          lookup_rec() // USE!        |   ftrace_release_mod() // Free!

To fix this issue:
  1. Hold rcu lock as accessing ftrace pages in ftrace_location_range();
  2. Use ftrace_location_range() instead of lookup_rec() in
     ftrace_location();
  3. Call synchronize_rcu() before freeing any ftrace pages both in
     ftrace_process_locs()/ftrace_release_mod()/ftrace_free_mem().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38588 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
