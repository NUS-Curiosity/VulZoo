Subject: CVE-2024-26784: pmdomain: arm: Fix NULL dereference on scmi_perf_domain removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pmdomain: arm: Fix NULL dereference on scmi_perf_domain removal

On unloading of the scmi_perf_domain module got the below splat, when in
the DT provided to the system under test the '#power-domain-cells' property
was missing. Indeed, this particular setup causes the probe to bail out
early without giving any error, which leads to the ->remove() callback gets
to run too, but without all the expected initialized structures in place.

Add a check and bail out early on remove too.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/f6aaf131e4d4a9a26040ecc018eb70ab8b3d355d
