Subject: CVE-2024-47695: RDMA/rtrs-clt: Reset cid to con_num - 1 to stay in bounds

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rtrs-clt: Reset cid to con_num - 1 to stay in bounds

In the function init_conns(), after the create_con() and create_cm() for
loop if something fails. In the cleanup for loop after the destroy tag, we
access out of bound memory because cid is set to clt_path->s.con_num.

This commits resets the cid to clt_path->s.con_num - 1, to stay in bounds
in the cleanup loop later.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47695 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
