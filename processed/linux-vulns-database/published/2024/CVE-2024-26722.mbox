Subject: CVE-2024-26722: ASoC: rt5645: Fix deadlock in rt5645_jack_detect_work()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: rt5645: Fix deadlock in rt5645_jack_detect_work()

There is a path in rt5645_jack_detect_work(), where rt5645->jd_mutex
is left locked forever. That may lead to deadlock
when rt5645_jack_detect_work() is called for the second time.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26722 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
