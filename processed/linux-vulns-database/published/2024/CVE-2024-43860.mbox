Subject: CVE-2024-43860: remoteproc: imx_rproc: Skip over memory region when node value is NULL

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

remoteproc: imx_rproc: Skip over memory region when node value is NULL

In imx_rproc_addr_init() "nph = of_count_phandle_with_args()" just counts
number of phandles. But phandles may be empty. So of_parse_phandle() in
the parsing loop (0 < a < nph) may return NULL which is later dereferenced.
Adjust this issue by adding NULL-return check.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

[Fixed title to fit within the prescribed 70-75 charcters]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43860 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
