Subject: CVE-2024-27075: media: dvb-frontends: avoid stack overflow warnings with clang

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvb-frontends: avoid stack overflow warnings with clang

A previous patch worked around a KASAN issue in stv0367, now a similar
problem showed up with clang:

drivers/media/dvb-frontends/stv0367.c:1222:12: error: stack frame size (3624) exceeds limit (2048) in 'stv0367ter_set_frontend' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than]
 1214 | static int stv0367ter_set_frontend(struct dvb_frontend *fe)

Rework the stv0367_writereg() function to be simpler and mark both
register access functions as noinline_for_stack so the temporary
i2c_msg structures do not get duplicated on the stack when KASAN_STACK
is enabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27075 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
