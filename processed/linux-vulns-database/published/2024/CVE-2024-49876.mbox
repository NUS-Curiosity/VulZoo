Subject: CVE-2024-49876: drm/xe: fix UAF around queue destruction

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: fix UAF around queue destruction

We currently do stuff like queuing the final destruction step on a
random system wq, which will outlive the driver instance. With bad
timing we can teardown the driver with one or more work workqueue still
being alive leading to various UAF splats. Add a fini step to ensure
user queues are properly torn down. At this point GuC should already be
nuked so queue itself should no longer be referenced from hw pov.

v2 (Matt B)
 - Looks much safer to use a waitqueue and then just wait for the
   xa_array to become empty before triggering the drain.

(cherry picked from commit 861108666cc0e999cffeab6aff17b662e68774e3)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49876 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
