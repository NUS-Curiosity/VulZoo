Subject: CVE-2024-47731: drivers/perf: Fix ali_drw_pmu driver interrupt status clearing

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drivers/perf: Fix ali_drw_pmu driver interrupt status clearing

The alibaba_uncore_pmu driver forgot to clear all interrupt status
in the interrupt processing function. After the PMU counter overflow
interrupt occurred, an interrupt storm occurred, causing the system
to hang.

Therefore, clear the correct interrupt status in the interrupt handling
function to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47731 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
