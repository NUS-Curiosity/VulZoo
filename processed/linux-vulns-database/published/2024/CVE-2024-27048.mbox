Subject: CVE-2024-27048: wifi: brcm80211: handle pmk_op allocation failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: brcm80211: handle pmk_op allocation failure

The kzalloc() in brcmf_pmksa_v3_op() will return null if the
physical memory has run out. As a result, if we dereference
the null value, the null pointer dereference bug will happen.

Return -ENOMEM from brcmf_pmksa_v3_op() if kzalloc() fails
for pmk_op.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27048 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
