Subject: CVE-2024-43889: padata: Fix possible divide-by-0 panic in padata_mt_helper()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

padata: Fix possible divide-by-0 panic in padata_mt_helper()

We are hit with a not easily reproducible divide-by-0 panic in padata.c at
bootup time.

  [   10.017908] Oops: divide error: 0000 1 PREEMPT SMP NOPTI

Looking at the padata_mt_helper() function, the only way a divide-by-0
panic can happen is when ps->chunk_size is 0.  The way that chunk_size is
initialized in padata_do_multithreaded(), chunk_size can be 0 when the
min_chunk in the passed-in padata_mt_job structure is 0.

Fix this divide-by-0 panic by making sure that chunk_size will be at least
1 no matter what the input parameters are.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43889 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
