Subject: CVE-2024-56710: ceph: fix memory leak in ceph_direct_read_write()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix memory leak in ceph_direct_read_write()

The bvecs array which is allocated in iter_get_bvecs_alloc() is leaked
and pages remain pinned if ceph_alloc_sparse_ext_map() fails.

There is no need to delay the allocation of sparse_ext map until after
the bvecs array is set up, so fix this by moving sparse_ext allocation
a bit earlier.  Also, make a similar adjustment in __ceph_sync_read()
for consistency (a leak of the same kind in __ceph_sync_read() has been
addressed differently).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56710 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
