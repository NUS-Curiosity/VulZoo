Subject: CVE-2024-57850: jffs2: Prevent rtime decompress memory corruption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jffs2: Prevent rtime decompress memory corruption

The rtime decompression routine does not fully check bounds during the
entirety of the decompression pass and can corrupt memory outside the
decompression buffer if the compressed data is corrupted. This adds the
required check to prevent this failure mode.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57850 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
