Subject: CVE-2024-56618: pmdomain: imx: gpcv2: Adjust delay after power up handshake

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pmdomain: imx: gpcv2: Adjust delay after power up handshake

The udelay(5) is not enough, sometimes below kernel panic
still be triggered:

The correct way is to wait handshake, but it needs BUS clock of
BLK-CTL be enabled, which is in separate driver. So delay is the
only option here. The udelay(10) is a data got by experiment.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56618 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a63907c8c712414643b597debcd09d16b6827b23
