Subject: CVE-2024-49969: drm/amd/display: Fix index out of bounds in DCN30 color transformation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix index out of bounds in DCN30 color transformation

This commit addresses a potential index out of bounds issue in the
`cm3_helper_translate_curve_to_hw_format` function in the DCN30 color
management module. The issue could occur when the index 'i' exceeds the
number of transfer function points (TRANSFER_FUNC_POINTS).

The fix adds a check to ensure 'i' is within bounds before accessing the
transfer function points. If 'i' is out of bounds, the function returns
false to indicate an error.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
