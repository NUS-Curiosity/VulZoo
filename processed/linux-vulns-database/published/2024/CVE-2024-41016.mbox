Subject: CVE-2024-41016: ocfs2: strict bound check before memcmp in ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: strict bound check before memcmp in ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()

xattr in ocfs2 maybe 'non-indexed', which saved with additional space
requested.  It's better to check if the memory is out of bound before
memcmp, although this possibility mainly comes from crafted poisonous
images.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41016 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
