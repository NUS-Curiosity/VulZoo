Subject: CVE-2024-41016: ocfs2: strict bound check before memcmp in ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ocfs2: strict bound check before memcmp in ocfs2_xattr_find_entry()

xattr in ocfs2 maybe 'non-indexed', which saved with additional space
requested.  It's better to check if the memory is out of bound before
memcmp, although this possibility mainly comes from crafted poisonous
images.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41016 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.11-rc1 with commit af77c4fc1871

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-41016
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/ocfs2/xattr.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
