Subject: CVE-2024-41097: usb: atm: cxacru: fix endpoint checking in cxacru_bind()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: atm: cxacru: fix endpoint checking in cxacru_bind()

Syzbot is still reporting quite an old issue [1] that occurs due to
incomplete checking of present usb endpoints. As such, wrong
endpoints types may be used at urb sumbitting stage which in turn
triggers a warning in usb_submit_urb().

Fix the issue by verifying that required endpoint types are present
for both in and out endpoints, taking into account cmd endpoint type.

Unfortunately, this patch has not been tested on real hardware.

[1] Syzbot report:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
