Subject: CVE-2024-26980: ksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in smb2_allocate_rsp_buf

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: fix slab-out-of-bounds in smb2_allocate_rsp_buf

If ->ProtocolId is SMB2_TRANSFORM_PROTO_NUM, smb2 request size
validation could be skipped. if request size is smaller than
sizeof(struct smb2_query_info_req), slab-out-of-bounds read can happen in
smb2_allocate_rsp_buf(). This patch allocate response buffer after
decrypting transform request. smb3_decrypt_req() will validate transform
request size and avoid slab-out-of-bound in smb2_allocate_rsp_buf().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26980 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
