Subject: CVE-2024-46868: firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: Fix deadlock in qcuefi_acquire()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: qcom: uefisecapp: Fix deadlock in qcuefi_acquire()

If the __qcuefi pointer is not set, then in the original code, we would
hold onto the lock.  That means that if we tried to set it later, then
it would cause a deadlock.  Drop the lock on the error path.  That's
what all the callers are expecting.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46868 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8c6a5a1fc02ad1d62d06897ab330693d4d27cd03
