Subject: CVE-2024-26618: arm64/sme: Always exit sme_alloc() early with existing storage

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64/sme: Always exit sme_alloc() early with existing storage

When sme_alloc() is called with existing storage and we are not flushing we
will always allocate new storage, both leaking the existing storage and
corrupting the state. Fix this by separating the checks for flushing and
for existing storage as we do for SVE.

Callers that reallocate (eg, due to changing the vector length) should
call sme_free() themselves.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26618 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/569156e4fa347237f8fa2a7e935d860109c55ac4
