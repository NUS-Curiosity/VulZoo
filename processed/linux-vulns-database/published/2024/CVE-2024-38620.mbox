Subject: CVE-2024-38620: Bluetooth: HCI: Remove HCI_AMP support

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: HCI: Remove HCI_AMP support

Since BT_HS has been remove HCI_AMP controllers no longer has any use so
remove it along with the capability of creating AMP controllers.

Since we no longer need to differentiate between AMP and Primary
controllers, as only HCI_PRIMARY is left, this also remove
hdev->dev_type altogether.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38620 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
