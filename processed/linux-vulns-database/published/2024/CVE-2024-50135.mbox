Subject: CVE-2024-50135: nvme-pci: fix race condition between reset and nvme_dev_disable()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvme-pci: fix race condition between reset and nvme_dev_disable()

nvme_dev_disable() modifies the dev->online_queues field, therefore
nvme_pci_update_nr_queues() should avoid racing against it, otherwise
we could end up passing invalid values to blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues().

 WARNING: CPU: 39 PID: 61303 at drivers/pci/msi/api.c:347
          pci_irq_get_affinity+0x187/0x210
 Workqueue: nvme-reset-wq nvme_reset_work [nvme]
 RIP: 0010:pci_irq_get_affinity+0x187/0x210
 Call Trace:
  <TASK>
  ? blk_mq_pci_map_queues+0x87/0x3c0
  ? pci_irq_get_affinity+0x187/0x210
  blk_mq_pci_map_queues+0x87/0x3c0

  blk_mq_update_nr_hw_queues+0x2a/0x40
  nvme_reset_work+0x1be/0x2a0 [nvme]

Fix the bug by locking the shutdown_lock mutex before using
dev->online_queues. Give up if nvme_dev_disable() is running or if
it has been executed already.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50135 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4ed32cc0939b64e3d7b48c8c0d63ea038775f304
