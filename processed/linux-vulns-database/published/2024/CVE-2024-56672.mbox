Subject: CVE-2024-56672: blk-cgroup: Fix UAF in blkcg_unpin_online()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

blk-cgroup: Fix UAF in blkcg_unpin_online()

blkcg_unpin_online() walks up the blkcg hierarchy putting the online pin. To
walk up, it uses blkcg_parent(blkcg) but it was calling that after
blkcg_destroy_blkgs(blkcg) which could free the blkcg, leading to the
following UAF:

Note that the UAF is not easy to trigger as the free path is indirected
behind a couple RCU grace periods and a work item execution. I could only
trigger it with artifical msleep() injected in blkcg_unpin_online().

Fix it by reading the parent pointer before destroying the blkcg's blkg's.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56672 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
