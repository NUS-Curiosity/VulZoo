Subject: CVE-2024-56543: wifi: ath12k: Skip Rx TID cleanup for self peer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: Skip Rx TID cleanup for self peer

During peer create, dp setup for the peer is done where Rx TID is
updated for all the TIDs. Peer object for self peer will not go through
dp setup.

When core halts, dp cleanup is done for all the peers. While cleanup,
rx_tid::ab is accessed which causes below stack trace for self peer.

WARNING: CPU: 6 PID: 12297 at drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath12k/dp_rx.c:851

sta object in peer will be updated when remote peer is created. Hence
use peer::sta to detect the self peer and skip the cleanup.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
