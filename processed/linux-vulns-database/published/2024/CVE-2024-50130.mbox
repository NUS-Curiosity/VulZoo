Subject: CVE-2024-50130: netfilter: bpf: must hold reference on net namespace

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: bpf: must hold reference on net namespace

BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __nf_unregister_net_hook+0x640/0x6b0
Read of size 8 at addr ffff8880106fe400 by task repro/72=
bpf_nf_link_release+0xda/0x1e0
bpf_link_free+0x139/0x2d0
bpf_link_release+0x68/0x80
__fput+0x414/0xb60

Eric says:
 It seems that bpf was able to defer the __nf_unregister_net_hook()
 after exit()/close() time.
 Perhaps a netns reference is missing, because the netns has been
 dismantled/freed already.
 bpf_nf_link_attach() does :
 link->net = net;
 But I do not see a reference being taken on net.

Add such a reference and release it after hook unreg.
Note that I was unable to get syzbot reproducer to work, so I
do not know if this resolves this splat.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50130 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
