Subject: CVE-2024-56615: bpf: fix OOB devmap writes when deleting elements

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: fix OOB devmap writes when deleting elements

Jordy reported issue against XSKMAP which also applies to DEVMAP - the
index used for accessing map entry, due to being a signed integer,
causes the OOB writes. Fix is simple as changing the type from int to
u32, however, when compared to XSKMAP case, one more thing needs to be
addressed.

When map is released from system via dev_map_free(), we iterate through
all of the entries and an iterator variable is also an int, which
implies OOB accesses. Again, change it to be u32.

Example splat below:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
