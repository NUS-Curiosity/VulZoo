Subject: CVE-2024-57799: phy: rockchip: samsung-hdptx: Set drvdata before enabling runtime PM

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: rockchip: samsung-hdptx: Set drvdata before enabling runtime PM

In some cases, rk_hdptx_phy_runtime_resume() may be invoked before
platform_set_drvdata() is executed in ->probe(), leading to a NULL
pointer dereference when using the return of dev_get_drvdata().

Ensure platform_set_drvdata() is called before devm_pm_runtime_enable().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57799 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
