Subject: CVE-2024-43815: crypto: mxs-dcp - Ensure payload is zero when using key slot

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: mxs-dcp - Ensure payload is zero when using key slot

We could leak stack memory through the payload field when running
AES with a key from one of the hardware's key slots. Fix this by
ensuring the payload field is set to 0 in such cases.

This does not affect the common use case when the key is supplied
from main memory via the descriptor payload.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43815 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e1640fed0377bf7276efb70d03cb821a6931063d
