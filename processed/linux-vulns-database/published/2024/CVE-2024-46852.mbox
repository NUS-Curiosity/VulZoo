Subject: CVE-2024-46852: dma-buf: heaps: Fix off-by-one in CMA heap fault handler

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dma-buf: heaps: Fix off-by-one in CMA heap fault handler

Until VM_DONTEXPAND was added in commit 1c1914d6e8c6 ("dma-buf: heaps:
Don't track CMA dma-buf pages under RssFile") it was possible to obtain
a mapping larger than the buffer size via mremap and bypass the overflow
check in dma_buf_mmap_internal. When using such a mapping to attempt to
fault past the end of the buffer, the CMA heap fault handler also checks
the fault offset against the buffer size, but gets the boundary wrong by
1. Fix the boundary check so that we don't read off the end of the pages
array and insert an arbitrary page in the mapping.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46852 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
