Subject: CVE-2024-57804: scsi: mpi3mr: Fix corrupt config pages PHY state is switched in sysfs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpi3mr: Fix corrupt config pages PHY state is switched in sysfs

The driver, through the SAS transport, exposes a sysfs interface to
enable/disable PHYs in a controller/expander setup.  When multiple PHYs
are disabled and enabled in rapid succession, the persistent and current
config pages related to SAS IO unit/SAS Expander pages could get
corrupted.

Use separate memory for each config request.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57804 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
