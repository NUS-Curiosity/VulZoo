Subject: CVE-2024-49994: block: fix integer overflow in BLKSECDISCARD

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix integer overflow in BLKSECDISCARD

I independently rediscovered

	commit 22d24a544b0d49bbcbd61c8c0eaf77d3c9297155
	block: fix overflow in blk_ioctl_discard()

but for secure erase.

Same problem:

	uint64_t r[2] = {512, 18446744073709551104ULL};
	ioctl(fd, BLKSECDISCARD, r);

will enter near infinite loop inside blkdev_issue_secure_erase():

	a.out: attempt to access beyond end of device
	loop0: rw=5, sector=3399043073, nr_sectors = 1024 limit=2048
	bio_check_eod: 3286214 callbacks suppressed

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49994 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
