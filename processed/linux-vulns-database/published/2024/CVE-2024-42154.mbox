Subject: CVE-2024-42154: tcp_metrics: validate source addr length

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp_metrics: validate source addr length

I don't see anything checking that TCP_METRICS_ATTR_SADDR_IPV4
is at least 4 bytes long, and the policy doesn't have an entry
for this attribute at all (neither does it for IPv6 but v6 is
manually validated).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42154 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
