Subject: CVE-2024-46838: userfaultfd: don't BUG_ON() if khugepaged yanks our page table

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

userfaultfd: don't BUG_ON() if khugepaged yanks our page table

Since khugepaged was changed to allow retracting page tables in file
mappings without holding the mmap lock, these BUG_ON()s are wrong - get
rid of them.

We could also remove the preceding "if (unlikely(...))" block, but then we
could reach pte_offset_map_lock() with transhuge pages not just for file
mappings but also for anonymous mappings - which would probably be fine
but I think is not necessarily expected.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46838 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4a594acc12d5954cdc71d4450a386748bf3d136a
