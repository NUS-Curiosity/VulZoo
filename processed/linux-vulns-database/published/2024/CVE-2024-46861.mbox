Subject: CVE-2024-46861: usbnet: ipheth: do not stop RX on failing RX callback

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usbnet: ipheth: do not stop RX on failing RX callback

RX callbacks can fail for multiple reasons:

* Payload too short
* Payload formatted incorrecly (e.g. bad NCM framing)
* Lack of memory

None of these should cause the driver to seize up.

Make such failures non-critical and continue processing further
incoming URBs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46861 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
