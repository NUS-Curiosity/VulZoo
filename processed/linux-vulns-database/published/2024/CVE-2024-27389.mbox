Subject: CVE-2024-27389: pstore: inode: Only d_invalidate() is needed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pstore: inode: Only d_invalidate() is needed

Unloading a modular pstore backend with records in pstorefs would
trigger the dput() double-drop warning:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2569 at fs/dcache.c:762 dput.part.0+0x3f3/0x410

Using the combo of d_drop()/dput() (as mentioned in
Documentation/filesystems/vfs.rst) isn't the right approach here, and
leads to the reference counting problem seen above. Use d_invalidate()
and update the code to not bother checking for error codes that can
never happen.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
