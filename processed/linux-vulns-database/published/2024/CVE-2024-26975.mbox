Subject: CVE-2024-26975: powercap: intel_rapl: Fix a NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powercap: intel_rapl: Fix a NULL pointer dereference

A NULL pointer dereference is triggered when probing the MMIO RAPL
driver on platforms with CPU ID not listed in intel_rapl_common CPU
model list.

This is because the intel_rapl_common module still probes on such
platforms even if 'defaults_msr' is not set after commit 1488ac990ac8
("powercap: intel_rapl: Allow probing without CPUID match"). Thus the
MMIO RAPL rp->priv->defaults is NULL when registering to RAPL framework.

Fix the problem by adding sanity check to ensure rp->priv->rapl_defaults
is always valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26975 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
