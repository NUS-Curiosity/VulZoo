Subject: CVE-2024-38576: rcu: Fix buffer overflow in print_cpu_stall_info()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

rcu: Fix buffer overflow in print_cpu_stall_info()

The rcuc-starvation output from print_cpu_stall_info() might overflow the
buffer if there is a huge difference in jiffies difference.  The situation
might seem improbable, but computers sometimes get very confused about
time, which can result in full-sized integers, and, in this case,
buffer overflow.

Also, the unsigned jiffies difference is printed using %ld, which is
normally for signed integers.  This is intentional for debugging purposes,
but it is not obvious from the code.

This commit therefore changes sprintf() to snprintf() and adds a
clarifying comment about intention of %ld format.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38576 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
