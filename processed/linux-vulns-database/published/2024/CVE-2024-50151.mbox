Subject: CVE-2024-50151: smb: client: fix OOBs when building SMB2_IOCTL request

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix OOBs when building SMB2_IOCTL request

When using encryption, either enforced by the server or when using
'seal' mount option, the client will squash all compound request buffers
down for encryption into a single iov in smb2_set_next_command().

SMB2_ioctl_init() allocates a small buffer (448 bytes) to hold the
SMB2_IOCTL request in the first iov, and if the user passes an input
buffer that is greater than 328 bytes, smb2_set_next_command() will
end up writing off the end of @rqst->iov[0].iov_base as shown below:

  mount.cifs //srv/share /mnt -o ...,seal
  ln -s $(perl -e "print('a')for 1..1024") /mnt/link

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
