Subject: CVE-2024-45030: igb: cope with large MAX_SKB_FRAGS

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igb: cope with large MAX_SKB_FRAGS

Sabrina reports that the igb driver does not cope well with large
MAX_SKB_FRAG values: setting MAX_SKB_FRAG to 45 causes payload
corruption on TX.

An easy reproducer is to run ssh to connect to the machine.  With
MAX_SKB_FRAGS=17 it works, with MAX_SKB_FRAGS=45 it fails.  This has
been reported originally in
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2265320

The root cause of the issue is that the driver does not take into
account properly the (possibly large) shared info size when selecting
the ring layout, and will try to fit two packets inside the same 4K
page even when the 1st fraglist will trump over the 2nd head.

Address the issue by checking if 2K buffers are insufficient.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-45030 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
