Subject: CVE-2024-35924: usb: typec: ucsi: Limit read size on v1.2

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: ucsi: Limit read size on v1.2

Between UCSI 1.2 and UCSI 2.0, the size of the MESSAGE_IN region was
increased from 16 to 256. In order to avoid overflowing reads for older
systems, add a mechanism to use the read UCSI version to truncate read
sizes on UCSI v1.2.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35924 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
