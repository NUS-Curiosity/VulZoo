Subject: CVE-2024-50292: ASoC: stm32: spdifrx: fix dma channel release in stm32_spdifrx_remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: stm32: spdifrx: fix dma channel release in stm32_spdifrx_remove

In case of error when requesting ctrl_chan DMA channel, ctrl_chan is not
null. So the release of the dma channel leads to the following issue:
[    4.879000] st,stm32-spdifrx 500d0000.audio-controller:
dma_request_slave_channel error -19
[    4.888975] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference
at virtual address 000000000000003d
[...]
[    5.096577] Call trace:
[    5.099099]  dma_release_channel+0x24/0x100
[    5.103235]  stm32_spdifrx_remove+0x24/0x60 [snd_soc_stm32_spdifrx]
[    5.109494]  stm32_spdifrx_probe+0x320/0x4c4 [snd_soc_stm32_spdifrx]

To avoid this issue, release channel only if the pointer is valid.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50292 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
