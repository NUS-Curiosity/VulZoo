Subject: CVE-2024-27411: drm/nouveau: keep DMA buffers required for suspend/resume

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau: keep DMA buffers required for suspend/resume

Nouveau deallocates a few buffers post GPU init which are required for GPU suspend/resume to function correctly.
This is likely not as big an issue on systems where the NVGPU is the only GPU, but on multi-GPU set ups it leads to a regression where the kernel module errors and results in a system-wide rendering freeze.

This commit addresses that regression by moving the two buffers required for suspend and resume to be deallocated at driver unload instead of post init.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27411 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.7.6 with commit 6190d4c08897d748dd25f0b78267a90aa1694e15 and fixed in 6.7.9 with commit be00e15b240ed71fc30c0576af7ab670c8271661

kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-27411
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/nouveau/nvkm/subdev/gsp/r535.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
