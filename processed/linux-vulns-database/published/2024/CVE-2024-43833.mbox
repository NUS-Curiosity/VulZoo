Subject: CVE-2024-43833: media: v4l: async: Fix NULL pointer dereference in adding ancillary links

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: v4l: async: Fix NULL pointer dereference in adding ancillary links

In v4l2_async_create_ancillary_links(), ancillary links are created for
lens and flash sub-devices. These are sub-device to sub-device links and
if the async notifier is related to a V4L2 device, the source sub-device
of the ancillary link is NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
Check the notifier's sd field is non-NULL in
v4l2_async_create_ancillary_links().

[Sakari Ailus: Reword the subject and commit messages slightly.]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43833 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
