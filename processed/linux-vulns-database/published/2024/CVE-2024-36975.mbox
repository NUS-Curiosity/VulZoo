Subject: CVE-2024-36975: KEYS: trusted: Do not use WARN when encode fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KEYS: trusted: Do not use WARN when encode fails

When asn1_encode_sequence() fails, WARN is not the correct solution.

1. asn1_encode_sequence() is not an internal function (located
   in lib/asn1_encode.c).
2. Location is known, which makes the stack trace useless.
3. Results a crash if panic_on_warn is set.

It is also noteworthy that the use of WARN is undocumented, and it
should be avoided unless there is a carefully considered rationale to
use it.

Replace WARN with pr_err, and print the return value instead, which is
only useful piece of information.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36975 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
