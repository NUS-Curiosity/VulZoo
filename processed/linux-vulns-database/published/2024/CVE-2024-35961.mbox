Subject: CVE-2024-35961: net/mlx5: Register devlink first under devlink lock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Register devlink first under devlink lock

In case device is having a non fatal FW error during probe, the
driver will report the error to user via devlink. This will trigger
a WARN_ON, since mlx5 is calling devlink_register() last.
In order to avoid the WARN_ON[1], change mlx5 to invoke devl_register()
first under devlink lock.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
