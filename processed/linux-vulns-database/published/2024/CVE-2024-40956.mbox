Subject: CVE-2024-40956: dmaengine: idxd: Fix possible Use-After-Free in irq_process_work_list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Fix possible Use-After-Free in irq_process_work_list

Use list_for_each_entry_safe() to allow iterating through the list and
deleting the entry in the iteration process. The descriptor is freed via
idxd_desc_complete() and there's a slight chance may cause issue for
the list iterator when the descriptor is reused by another thread
without it being deleted from the list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40956 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
