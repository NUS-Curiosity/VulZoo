Subject: CVE-2024-36009: ax25: Fix netdev refcount issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ax25: Fix netdev refcount issue

The dev_tracker is added to ax25_cb in ax25_bind(). When the
ax25 device is detaching, the dev_tracker of ax25_cb should be
deallocated in ax25_kill_by_device() instead of the dev_tracker
of ax25_dev. The log reported by ref_tracker is shown below:

Change ax25_dev->dev_tracker to the dev_tracker of ax25_cb
in order to mitigate the bug.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
