Subject: CVE-2024-57995: wifi: ath12k: fix read pointer after free in ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix read pointer after free in ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev()

In ath12k_mac_assign_vif_to_vdev(), if arvif is created on a different
radio, it gets deleted from that radio through a call to
ath12k_mac_unassign_link_vif(). This action frees the arvif pointer.
Subsequently, there is a check involving arvif, which will result in a
read-after-free scenario.

Fix this by moving this check after arvif is again assigned via call to
ath12k_mac_assign_link_vif().

Tested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57995 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
