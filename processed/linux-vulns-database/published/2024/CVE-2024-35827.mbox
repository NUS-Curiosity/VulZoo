Subject: CVE-2024-35827: io_uring/net: fix overflow check in io_recvmsg_mshot_prep()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/net: fix overflow check in io_recvmsg_mshot_prep()

The "controllen" variable is type size_t (unsigned long).  Casting it
to int could lead to an integer underflow.

The check_add_overflow() function considers the type of the destination
which is type int.  If we add two positive values and the result cannot
fit in an integer then that's counted as an overflow.

However, if we cast "controllen" to an int and it turns negative, then
negative values *can* fit into an int type so there is no overflow.

Good: 100 + (unsigned long)-4 = 96  <-- overflow
 Bad: 100 + (int)-4 = 96 <-- no overflow

I deleted the cast of the sizeof() as well.  That's not a bug but the
cast is unnecessary.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35827 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
