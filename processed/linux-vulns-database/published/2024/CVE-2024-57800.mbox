Subject: CVE-2024-57800: ALSA: memalloc: prefer dma_mapping_error() over explicit address checking

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: memalloc: prefer dma_mapping_error() over explicit address checking

With CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG enabled, the following warning is observed:

DMA-API: snd_hda_intel 0000:03:00.1: device driver failed to check map error[device address=0x00000000ffff0000] [size=20480 bytes] [mapped as single]

Check for returned DMA addresses using specialized dma_mapping_error()
helper which is generally recommended for this purpose by
Documentation/core-api/dma-api.rst.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57800 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c180c3f42d340e8dcb9094bb8ea7d477d37081a8
