Subject: CVE-2024-56616: drm/dp_mst: Fix MST sideband message body length check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/dp_mst: Fix MST sideband message body length check

Fix the MST sideband message body length check, which must be at least 1
byte accounting for the message body CRC (aka message data CRC) at the
end of the message.

This fixes a case where an MST branch device returns a header with a
correct header CRC (indicating a correctly received body length), with
the body length being incorrectly set to 0. This will later lead to a
memory corruption in drm_dp_sideband_append_payload() and the following
errors in dmesg:

   UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in drivers/gpu/drm/display/drm_dp_mst_topology.c:786:25
   index -1 is out of range for type 'u8 [48]'

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
