Subject: CVE-2024-44954: ALSA: line6: Fix racy access to midibuf

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: line6: Fix racy access to midibuf

There can be concurrent accesses to line6 midibuf from both the URB
completion callback and the rawmidi API access.  This could be a cause
of KMSAN warning triggered by syzkaller below (so put as reported-by
here).

This patch protects the midibuf call of the former code path with a
spinlock for avoiding the possible races.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44954 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
