Subject: CVE-2024-56688: sunrpc: clear XPRT_SOCK_UPD_TIMEOUT when reset transport

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sunrpc: clear XPRT_SOCK_UPD_TIMEOUT when reset transport

Since transport->sock has been set to NULL during reset transport,
XPRT_SOCK_UPD_TIMEOUT also needs to be cleared. Otherwise, the
xs_tcp_set_socket_timeouts() may be triggered in xs_tcp_send_request()
to dereference the transport->sock that has been set to NULL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56688 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
