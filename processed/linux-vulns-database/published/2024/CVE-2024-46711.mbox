Subject: CVE-2024-46711: mptcp: pm: fix ID 0 endp usage after multiple re-creations

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: pm: fix ID 0 endp usage after multiple re-creations

'local_addr_used' and 'add_addr_accepted' are decremented for addresses
not related to the initial subflow (ID0), because the source and
destination addresses of the initial subflows are known from the
beginning: they don't count as "additional local address being used" or
"ADD_ADDR being accepted".

It is then required not to increment them when the entrypoint used by
the initial subflow is removed and re-added during a connection. Without
this modification, this entrypoint cannot be removed and re-added more
than once.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46711 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
