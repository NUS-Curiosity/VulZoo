Subject: CVE-2024-53104: media: uvcvideo: Skip parsing frames of type UVC_VS_UNDEFINED in uvc_parse_format

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: uvcvideo: Skip parsing frames of type UVC_VS_UNDEFINED in uvc_parse_format

This can lead to out of bounds writes since frames of this type were not
taken into account when calculating the size of the frames buffer in
uvc_parse_streaming.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53104 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
