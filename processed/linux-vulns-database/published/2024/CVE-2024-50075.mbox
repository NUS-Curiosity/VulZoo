Subject: CVE-2024-50075: xhci: tegra: fix checked USB2 port number

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xhci: tegra: fix checked USB2 port number

If USB virtualizatoin is enabled, USB2 ports are shared between all
Virtual Functions. The USB2 port number owned by an USB2 root hub in
a Virtual Function may be less than total USB2 phy number supported
by the Tegra XUSB controller.

Using total USB2 phy number as port number to check all PORTSC values
would cause invalid memory access.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
