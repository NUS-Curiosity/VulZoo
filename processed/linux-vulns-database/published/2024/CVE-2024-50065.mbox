Subject: CVE-2024-50065: ntfs3: Change to non-blocking allocation in ntfs_d_hash

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ntfs3: Change to non-blocking allocation in ntfs_d_hash

d_hash is done while under "rcu-walk" and should not sleep.
__get_name() allocates using GFP_KERNEL, having the possibility
to sleep when under memory pressure. Change the allocation to
GFP_NOWAIT.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50065 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
