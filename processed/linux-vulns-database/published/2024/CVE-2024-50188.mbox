Subject: CVE-2024-50188: net: phy: dp83869: fix memory corruption when enabling fiber

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: phy: dp83869: fix memory corruption when enabling fiber

When configuring the fiber port, the DP83869 PHY driver incorrectly
calls linkmode_set_bit() with a bit mask (1 << 10) rather than a bit
number (10). This corrupts some other memory location -- in case of
arm64 the priv pointer in the same structure.

Since the advertising flags are updated from supported at the end of the
function the incorrect line isn't needed at all and can be removed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50188 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
