Subject: CVE-2024-36951: drm/amdkfd: range check cp bad op exception interrupts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: range check cp bad op exception interrupts

Due to a CP interrupt bug, bad packet garbage exception codes are raised.
Do a range check so that the debugger and runtime do not receive garbage
codes.
Update the user api to guard exception code type checking as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36951 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
