Subject: CVE-2024-43859: f2fs: fix to truncate preallocated blocks in f2fs_file_open()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to truncate preallocated blocks in f2fs_file_open()

chenyuwen reports a f2fs bug as below:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000011

 do_el0_svc+0x28/0xa0
 el0_svc+0x24/0x84
 el0t_64_sync_handler+0x88/0xec

It is because inode.i_crypt_info is not initialized during below path:
- mount
 - f2fs_fill_super
  - f2fs_disable_checkpoint
   - f2fs_gc
    - f2fs_iget
     - f2fs_truncate

So, let's relocate truncation of preallocated blocks to f2fs_file_open(),
after fscrypt_file_open().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43859 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
