Subject: CVE-2024-41004: tracing: Build event generation tests only as modules

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Build event generation tests only as modules

The kprobes and synth event generation test modules add events and lock
(get a reference) those event file reference in module init function,
and unlock and delete it in module exit function. This is because those
are designed for playing as modules.

If we make those modules as built-in, those events are left locked in the
kernel, and never be removed. This causes kprobe event self-test failure
as below.

And also, since we can not cleanup dynamic_event file, ftracetest are
failed too.

To avoid these issues, build these tests only as modules.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41004 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
