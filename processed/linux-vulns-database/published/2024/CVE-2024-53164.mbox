Subject: CVE-2024-53164: net: sched: fix ordering of qlen adjustment

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: sched: fix ordering of qlen adjustment

Changes to sch->q.qlen around qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() need to happen
_before_ a call to said function because otherwise it may fail to notify
parent qdiscs when the child is about to become empty.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53164 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
