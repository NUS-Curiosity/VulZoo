Subject: CVE-2024-26714: interconnect: qcom: sc8180x: Mark CO0 BCM keepalive

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

interconnect: qcom: sc8180x: Mark CO0 BCM keepalive

The CO0 BCM needs to be up at all times, otherwise some hardware (like
the UFS controller) loses its connection to the rest of the SoC,
resulting in a hang of the platform, accompanied by a spectacular
logspam.

Mark it as keepalive to prevent such cases.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26714 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
