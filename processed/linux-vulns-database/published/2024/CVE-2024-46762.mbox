Subject: CVE-2024-46762: xen: privcmd: Fix possible access to a freed kirqfd instance

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen: privcmd: Fix possible access to a freed kirqfd instance

Nothing prevents simultaneous ioctl calls to privcmd_irqfd_assign() and
privcmd_irqfd_deassign(). If that happens, it is possible that a kirqfd
created and added to the irqfds_list by privcmd_irqfd_assign() may get
removed by another thread executing privcmd_irqfd_deassign(), while the
former is still using it after dropping the locks.

This can lead to a situation where an already freed kirqfd instance may
be accessed and cause kernel oops.

Use SRCU locking to prevent the same, as is done for the KVM
implementation for irqfds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46762 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
