Subject: CVE-2024-56647: net: Fix icmp host relookup triggering ip_rt_bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: Fix icmp host relookup triggering ip_rt_bug

arp link failure may trigger ip_rt_bug while xfrm enabled, call trace is:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at net/ipv4/route.c:1241 ip_rt_bug+0x14/0x20
Modules linked in:
CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 6.12.0-rc6-00077-g2e1b3cc9d7f7

RIP: 0010:ip_rt_bug+0x14/0x20

The script below reproduces this scenario:
ip xfrm policy add src 0.0.0.0/0 dst 0.0.0.0/0 \
	dir out priority 0 ptype main flag localok icmp
ip l a veth1 type veth
ip a a 192.168.141.111/24 dev veth0
ip l s veth0 up
ping 192.168.141.155 -c 1

icmp_route_lookup() create input routes for locally generated packets
while xfrm relookup ICMP traffic.Then it will set input route
(dst->out = ip_rt_bug) to skb for DESTUNREACH.

For ICMP err triggered by locally generated packets, dst->dev of output
route is loopback. Generally, xfrm relookup verification is not required
on loopback interfaces (net.ipv4.conf.lo.disable_xfrm = 1).

Skip icmp relookup for locally generated packets to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56647 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
