Subject: CVE-2024-36918: bpf: Check bloom filter map value size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Check bloom filter map value size

This patch adds a missing check to bloom filter creating, rejecting
values above KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE. This brings the bloom map in line with
many other map types.

The lack of this protection can cause kernel crashes for value sizes
that overflow int's. Such a crash was caught by syzkaller. The next
patch adds more guard-rails at a lower level.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36918 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
