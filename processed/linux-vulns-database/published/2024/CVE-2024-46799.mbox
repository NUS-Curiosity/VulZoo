Subject: CVE-2024-46799: net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NULL dereference on XDP_TX

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix NULL dereference on XDP_TX

If number of TX queues are set to 1 we get a NULL pointer
dereference during XDP_TX.

~# ethtool -L eth0 tx 1
~# ./xdp-trafficgen udp -A <ipv6-src> -a <ipv6-dst> eth0 -t 2
Transmitting on eth0 (ifindex 2)
[  241.135257] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000030

Fix this by using actual TX queues instead of max TX queues
when picking the TX channel in am65_cpsw_ndo_xdp_xmit().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46799 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
