Subject: CVE-2024-38385: genirq/irqdesc: Prevent use-after-free in irq_find_at_or_after()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

genirq/irqdesc: Prevent use-after-free in irq_find_at_or_after()

irq_find_at_or_after() dereferences the interrupt descriptor which is
returned by mt_find() while neither holding sparse_irq_lock nor RCU read
lock, which means the descriptor can be freed between mt_find() and the
dereference:

    CPU0                            CPU1
    desc = mt_find()
                                    delayed_free_desc(desc)
    irq_desc_get_irq(desc)

The use-after-free is reported by KASAN:

     irq_get_next_irq+0x58/0x84

Guard the access with a RCU read lock section.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38385 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c7891812d85500ae2ca4051fa5683fcf29930d8
