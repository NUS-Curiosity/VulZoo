Subject: CVE-2024-41028: platform/x86: toshiba_acpi: Fix array out-of-bounds access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: toshiba_acpi: Fix array out-of-bounds access

In order to use toshiba_dmi_quirks[] together with the standard DMI
matching functions, it must be terminated by a empty entry.

Since this entry is missing, an array out-of-bounds access occurs
every time the quirk list is processed.

Fix this by adding the terminating empty entry.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41028 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
