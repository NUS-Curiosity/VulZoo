Subject: CVE-2024-42085: usb: dwc3: core: remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume to avoid deadlock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: core: remove lock of otg mode during gadget suspend/resume to avoid deadlock

When config CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DUAL_ROLE is selected, and trigger system
to enter suspend status with below command:
echo mem > /sys/power/state
There will be a deadlock issue occurring. Detailed invoking path as
below:
dwc3_suspend_common()
    spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);              <-- 1st
    dwc3_gadget_suspend(dwc);
        dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect(dwc);
            spin_lock_irqsave(&dwc->lock, flags);      <-- 2nd
This issue is exposed by commit c7ebd8149ee5 ("usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix
NULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend") that removes the code
of checking whether dwc->gadget_driver is NULL or not. It causes the
following code is executed and deadlock occurs when trying to get the
spinlock. In fact, the root cause is the commit 5265397f9442("usb: dwc3:
Remove DWC3 locking during gadget suspend/resume") that forgot to remove
the lock of otg mode. So, remove the redundant lock of otg mode during
gadget suspend/resume.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42085 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
