Subject: CVE-2024-26760: scsi: target: pscsi: Fix bio_put() for error case

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: target: pscsi: Fix bio_put() for error case

As of commit 066ff571011d ("block: turn bio_kmalloc into a simple kmalloc
wrapper"), a bio allocated by bio_kmalloc() must be freed by bio_uninit()
and kfree(). That is not done properly for the error case, hitting WARN and
NULL pointer dereference in bio_free().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26760 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
