Subject: CVE-2024-39498: drm/mst: Fix NULL pointer dereference at drm_dp_add_payload_part2

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mst: Fix NULL pointer dereference at drm_dp_add_payload_part2

[Why]
Commit:
- commit 5aa1dfcdf0a4 ("drm/mst: Refactor the flow for payload allocation/removement")
accidently overwrite the commit
- commit 54d217406afe ("drm: use mgr->dev in drm_dbg_kms in drm_dp_add_payload_part2")
which cause regression.

[How]
Recover the original NULL fix and remove the unnecessary input parameter 'state' for
drm_dp_add_payload_part2().

(cherry picked from commit 4545614c1d8da603e57b60dd66224d81b6ffc305)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
