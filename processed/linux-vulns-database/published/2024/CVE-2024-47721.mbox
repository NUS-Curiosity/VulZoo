Subject: CVE-2024-47721: wifi: rtw89: remove unused C2H event ID RTW89_MAC_C2H_FUNC_READ_WOW_CAM to prevent out-of-bounds reading

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: rtw89: remove unused C2H event ID RTW89_MAC_C2H_FUNC_READ_WOW_CAM to prevent out-of-bounds reading

The handler of firmware C2H event RTW89_MAC_C2H_FUNC_READ_WOW_CAM isn't
implemented, but driver expects number of handlers is
NUM_OF_RTW89_MAC_C2H_FUNC_WOW causing out-of-bounds access. Fix it by
removing ID.

Addresses-Coverity-ID: 1598775 ("Out-of-bounds read")

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
