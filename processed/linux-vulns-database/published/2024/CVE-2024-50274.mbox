Subject: CVE-2024-50274: idpf: avoid vport access in idpf_get_link_ksettings

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

idpf: avoid vport access in idpf_get_link_ksettings

When the device control plane is removed or the platform
running device control plane is rebooted, a reset is detected
on the driver. On driver reset, it releases the resources and
waits for the reset to complete. If the reset fails, it takes
the error path and releases the vport lock. At this time if the
monitoring tools tries to access link settings, it call traces
for accessing released vport pointer.

To avoid it, move link_speed_mbps to netdev_priv structure
which removes the dependency on vport pointer and the vport lock
in idpf_get_link_ksettings. Also use netif_carrier_ok()
to check the link status and adjust the offsetof to use link_up
instead of link_speed_mbps.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50274 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fa4d906ad0fb63a980a1d586a061c78ea1a345ba
