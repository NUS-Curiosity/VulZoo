Subject: CVE-2024-40941: wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't read past the mfuart notifcation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: don't read past the mfuart notifcation

In case the firmware sends a notification that claims it has more data
than it has, we will read past that was allocated for the notification.
Remove the print of the buffer, we won't see it by default. If needed,
we can see the content with tracing.

This was reported by KFENCE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40941 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
