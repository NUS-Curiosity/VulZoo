Subject: CVE-2024-56724: mfd: intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc: Use IRQ domain for TMU device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mfd: intel_soc_pmic_bxtwc: Use IRQ domain for TMU device

While design wise the idea of converting the driver to use
the hierarchy of the IRQ chips is correct, the implementation
has (inherited) flaws. This was unveiled when platform_get_irq()
had started WARN() on IRQ 0 that is supposed to be a Linux
IRQ number (also known as vIRQ).

Rework the driver to respect IRQ domain when creating each MFD
device separately, as the domain is not the same for all of them.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56724 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
