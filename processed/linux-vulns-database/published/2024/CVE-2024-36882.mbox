Subject: CVE-2024-36882: mm: use memalloc_nofs_save() in page_cache_ra_order()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: use memalloc_nofs_save() in page_cache_ra_order()

See commit f2c817bed58d ("mm: use memalloc_nofs_save in readahead path"),
ensure that page_cache_ra_order() do not attempt to reclaim file-backed
pages too, or it leads to a deadlock, found issue when test ext4 large
folio.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
