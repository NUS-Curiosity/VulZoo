Subject: CVE-2024-49907: drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before using dc->clk_mgr

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check null pointers before using dc->clk_mgr

[WHY & HOW]
dc->clk_mgr is null checked previously in the same function, indicating
it might be null.

Passing "dc" to "dc->hwss.apply_idle_power_optimizations", which
dereferences null "dc->clk_mgr". (The function pointer resolves to
"dcn35_apply_idle_power_optimizations".)

This fixes 1 FORWARD_NULL issue reported by Coverity.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49907 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
