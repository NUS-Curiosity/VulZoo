Subject: CVE-2024-26927: ASoC: SOF: Add some bounds checking to firmware data

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: Add some bounds checking to firmware data

Smatch complains about "head->full_size - head->header_size" can
underflow.  To some extent, we're always going to have to trust the
firmware a bit.  However, it's easy enough to add a check for negatives,
and let's add a upper bounds check as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26927 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
