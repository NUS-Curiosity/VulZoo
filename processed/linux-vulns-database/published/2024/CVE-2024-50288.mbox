Subject: CVE-2024-50288: media: vivid: fix buffer overwrite when using > 32 buffers

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: vivid: fix buffer overwrite when using > 32 buffers

The maximum number of buffers that can be requested was increased to
64 for the video capture queue. But video capture used a must_blank
array that was still sized for 32 (VIDEO_MAX_FRAME). This caused an
out-of-bounds write when using buffer indices >= 32.

Create a new define MAX_VID_CAP_BUFFERS that is used to access the
must_blank array and set max_num_buffers for the video capture queue.

This solves a crash reported by:

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50288 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
