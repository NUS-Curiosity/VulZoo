Subject: CVE-2024-50030: drm/xe/ct: prevent UAF in send_recv()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/ct: prevent UAF in send_recv()

Ensure we serialize with completion side to prevent UAF with fence going
out of scope on the stack, since we have no clue if it will fire after
the timeout before we can erase from the xa. Also we have some dependent
loads and stores for which we need the correct ordering, and we lack the
needed barriers. Fix this by grabbing the ct->lock after the wait, which
is also held by the completion side.

v2 (Badal):
 - Also print done after acquiring the lock and seeing timeout.

(cherry picked from commit 52789ce35c55ccd30c4b67b9cc5b2af55e0122ea)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50030 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ed7dd4c55e4fb21531a9645aeb66a30eaf43a46
