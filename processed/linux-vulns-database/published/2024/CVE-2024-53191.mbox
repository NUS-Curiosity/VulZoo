Subject: CVE-2024-53191: wifi: ath12k: fix warning when unbinding

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix warning when unbinding

If there is an error during some initialization related to firmware,
the buffers dp->tx_ring[i].tx_status are released.
However this is released again when the device is unbinded (ath12k_pci),
and we get:
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 2098 at mm/slub.c:4689 free_large_kmalloc+0x4d/0x80
Call Trace:
free_large_kmalloc
ath12k_dp_free
ath12k_core_deinit
ath12k_pci_remove
...

The issue is always reproducible from a VM because the MSI addressing
initialization is failing.

In order to fix the issue, just set the buffers to NULL after releasing in
order to avoid the double free.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53191 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
