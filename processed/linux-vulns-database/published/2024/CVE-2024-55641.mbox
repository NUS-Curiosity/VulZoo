Subject: CVE-2024-55641: xfs: unlock inodes when erroring out of xfs_trans_alloc_dir

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xfs: unlock inodes when erroring out of xfs_trans_alloc_dir

Debugging a filesystem patch with generic/475 caused the system to hang
after observing the following sequences in dmesg:

 XFS (dm-0): metadata I/O error in "xfs_imap_to_bp+0x61/0xe0 [xfs]" at daddr 0x491520 len 32 error 5
 XFS (dm-0): metadata I/O error in "xfs_btree_read_buf_block+0xba/0x160 [xfs]" at daddr 0x3445608 len 8 error 5
 XFS (dm-0): metadata I/O error in "xfs_imap_to_bp+0x61/0xe0 [xfs]" at daddr 0x138e1c0 len 32 error 5
 XFS (dm-0): log I/O error -5
 XFS (dm-0): Metadata I/O Error (0x1) detected at xfs_trans_read_buf_map+0x1ea/0x4b0 [xfs] (fs/xfs/xfs_trans_buf.c:311).  Shutting down filesystem.
 XFS (dm-0): Please unmount the filesystem and rectify the problem(s)
 XFS (dm-0): Internal error dqp->q_ino.reserved < dqp->q_ino.count at line 869 of file fs/xfs/xfs_trans_dquot.c.  Caller xfs_trans_dqresv+0x236/0x440 [xfs]
 XFS (dm-0): Corruption detected. Unmount and run xfs_repair
 XFS (dm-0): Unmounting Filesystem be6bcbcc-9921-4deb-8d16-7cc94e335fa7

The system is stuck in unmount trying to lock a couple of inodes so that
they can be purged.  The dquot corruption notice above is a clue to what
happened -- a link() call tried to set up a transaction to link a child
into a directory.  Quota reservation for the transaction failed after IO
errors shut down the filesystem, but then we forgot to unlock the inodes
on our way out.  Fix that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-55641 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6aefe5d97ae57b1343dc60d8bb6a4ed070e5bcea
