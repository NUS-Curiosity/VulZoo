Subject: CVE-2024-40924: drm/i915/dpt: Make DPT object unshrinkable

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/i915/dpt: Make DPT object unshrinkable

In some scenarios, the DPT object gets shrunk but
the actual framebuffer did not and thus its still
there on the DPT's vm->bound_list. Then it tries to
rewrite the PTEs via a stale CPU mapping. This causes panic.

[vsyrjala: Add TODO comment]
(cherry picked from commit 51064d471c53dcc8eddd2333c3f1c1d9131ba36c)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40924 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
