Subject: CVE-2024-49936: net/xen-netback: prevent UAF in xenvif_flush_hash()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/xen-netback: prevent UAF in xenvif_flush_hash()

During the list_for_each_entry_rcu iteration call of xenvif_flush_hash,
kfree_rcu does not exist inside the rcu read critical section, so if
kfree_rcu is called when the rcu grace period ends during the iteration,
UAF occurs when accessing head->next after the entry becomes free.

Therefore, to solve this, you need to change it to list_for_each_entry_safe.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49936 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
