Subject: CVE-2024-56764: ublk: detach gendisk from ublk device if add_disk() fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: detach gendisk from ublk device if add_disk() fails

Inside ublk_abort_requests(), gendisk is grabbed for aborting all
inflight requests. And ublk_abort_requests() is called when exiting
the uring context or handling timeout.

If add_disk() fails, the gendisk may have been freed when calling
ublk_abort_requests(), so use-after-free can be caused when getting
disk's reference in ublk_abort_requests().

Fixes the bug by detaching gendisk from ublk device if add_disk() fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56764 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
