Subject: CVE-2024-26611: xsk: fix usage of multi-buffer BPF helpers for ZC XDP

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xsk: fix usage of multi-buffer BPF helpers for ZC XDP

Currently when packet is shrunk via bpf_xdp_adjust_tail() and memory
type is set to MEM_TYPE_XSK_BUFF_POOL, null ptr dereference happens:

This comes from __xdp_return() call with xdp_buff argument passed as
NULL which is supposed to be consumed by xsk_buff_free() call.

To address this properly, in ZC case, a node that represents the frag
being removed has to be pulled out of xskb_list. Introduce
appropriate xsk helpers to do such node operation and use them
accordingly within bpf_xdp_adjust_tail().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26611 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
