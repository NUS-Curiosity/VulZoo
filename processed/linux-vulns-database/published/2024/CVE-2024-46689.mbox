Subject: CVE-2024-46689: soc: qcom: cmd-db: Map shared memory as WC, not WB

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: qcom: cmd-db: Map shared memory as WC, not WB

Linux does not write into cmd-db region. This region of memory is write
protected by XPU. XPU may sometime falsely detect clean cache eviction
as "write" into the write protected region leading to secure interrupt
which causes an endless loop somewhere in Trust Zone.

The only reason it is working right now is because Qualcomm Hypervisor
maps the same region as Non-Cacheable memory in Stage 2 translation
tables. The issue manifests if we want to use another hypervisor (like
Xen or KVM), which does not know anything about those specific mappings.

Changing the mapping of cmd-db memory from MEMREMAP_WB to MEMREMAP_WT/WC
removes dependency on correct mappings in Stage 2 tables. This patch
fixes the issue by updating the mapping to MEMREMAP_WC.

I tested this on SA8155P with Xen.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46689 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
