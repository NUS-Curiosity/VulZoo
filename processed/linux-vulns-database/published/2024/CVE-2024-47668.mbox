Subject: CVE-2024-47668: lib/generic-radix-tree.c: Fix rare race in __genradix_ptr_alloc()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

lib/generic-radix-tree.c: Fix rare race in __genradix_ptr_alloc()

If we need to increase the tree depth, allocate a new node, and then
race with another thread that increased the tree depth before us, we'll
still have a preallocated node that might be used later.

If we then use that node for a new non-root node, it'll still have a
pointer to the old root instead of being zeroed - fix this by zeroing it
in the cmpxchg failure path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47668 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
