Subject: CVE-2024-57926: drm/mediatek: Set private->all_drm_private[i]->drm to NULL if mtk_drm_bind returns err

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/mediatek: Set private->all_drm_private[i]->drm to NULL if mtk_drm_bind returns err

The pointer need to be set to NULL, otherwise KASAN complains about
use-after-free. Because in mtk_drm_bind, all private's drm are set
as follows.

private->all_drm_private[i]->drm = drm;

And drm will be released by drm_dev_put in case mtk_drm_kms_init returns
failure. However, the shutdown path still accesses the previous allocated
memory in drm_atomic_helper_shutdown.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
