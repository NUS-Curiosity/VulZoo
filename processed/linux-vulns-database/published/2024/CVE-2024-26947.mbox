Subject: CVE-2024-26947: ARM: 9359/1: flush: check if the folio is reserved for no-mapping addresses

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ARM: 9359/1: flush: check if the folio is reserved for no-mapping addresses

Since commit a4d5613c4dc6 ("arm: extend pfn_valid to take into account
freed memory map alignment") changes the semantics of pfn_valid() to check
presence of the memory map for a PFN. A valid page for an address which
is reserved but not mapped by the kernel[1], the system crashed during
some uio test with the following memory layout:

 node   0: [mem 0x00000000c0a00000-0x00000000cc8fffff]
 node   0: [mem 0x00000000d0000000-0x00000000da1fffff]
 the uio layout isï¼š0xc0900000, 0x100000

the crash backtrace like:

  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address bff00000

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
