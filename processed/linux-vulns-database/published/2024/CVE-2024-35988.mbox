Subject: CVE-2024-35988: riscv: Fix TASK_SIZE on 64-bit NOMMU

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

riscv: Fix TASK_SIZE on 64-bit NOMMU

On NOMMU, userspace memory can come from anywhere in physical RAM. The
current definition of TASK_SIZE is wrong if any RAM exists above 4G,
causing spurious failures in the userspace access routines.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35988 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
