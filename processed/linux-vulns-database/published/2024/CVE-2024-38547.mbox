Subject: CVE-2024-38547: media: atomisp: ssh_css: Fix a null-pointer dereference in load_video_binaries

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: atomisp: ssh_css: Fix a null-pointer dereference in load_video_binaries

The allocation failure of mycs->yuv_scaler_binary in load_video_binaries()
is followed with a dereference of mycs->yuv_scaler_binary after the
following call chain:

sh_css_pipe_load_binaries()
  |-> load_video_binaries(mycs->yuv_scaler_binary == NULL)
  |
  |-> sh_css_pipe_unload_binaries()
        |-> unload_video_binaries()

In unload_video_binaries(), it calls to ia_css_binary_unload with argument
&pipe->pipe_settings.video.yuv_scaler_binary[i], which refers to the
same memory slot as mycs->yuv_scaler_binary. Thus, a null-pointer
dereference is triggered.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38547 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
