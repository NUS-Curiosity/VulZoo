Subject: CVE-2024-46698: video/aperture: optionally match the device in sysfb_disable()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

video/aperture: optionally match the device in sysfb_disable()

In aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices(), we currently only
call sysfb_disable() on vga class devices.  This leads to the
following problem when the pimary device is not VGA compatible:

1. A PCI device with a non-VGA class is the boot display
2. That device is probed first and it is not a VGA device so
   sysfb_disable() is not called, but the device resources
   are freed by aperture_detach_platform_device()
3. Non-primary GPU has a VGA class and it ends up calling sysfb_disable()
4. NULL pointer dereference via sysfb_disable() since the resources
   have already been freed by aperture_detach_platform_device() when
   it was called by the other device.

Fix this by passing a device pointer to sysfb_disable() and checking
the device to determine if we should execute it or not.

v2: Fix build when CONFIG_SCREEN_INFO is not set
v3: Move device check into the mutex
    Drop primary variable in aperture_remove_conflicting_pci_devices()
    Drop __init on pci sysfb_pci_dev_is_enabled()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46698 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/17e78f43de0c6da34204cc858b4cc05671ea9acf
