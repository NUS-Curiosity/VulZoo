Subject: CVE-2024-26989: arm64: hibernate: Fix level3 translation fault in swsusp_save()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: hibernate: Fix level3 translation fault in swsusp_save()

On arm64 machines, swsusp_save() faults if it attempts to access
MEMBLOCK_NOMAP memory ranges. This can be reproduced in QEMU using UEFI
when booting with rodata=off debug_pagealloc=off and CONFIG_KFENCE=n:

  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffffff8000000000

   state_store+0xf0/0x10c
   kobj_attr_store+0x14/0x24

The reason is swsusp_save() -> copy_data_pages() -> page_is_saveable()
-> kernel_page_present() assuming that a page is always present when
can_set_direct_map() is false (all of rodata_full,
debug_pagealloc_enabled() and arm64_kfence_can_set_direct_map() false),
irrespective of the MEMBLOCK_NOMAP ranges. Such MEMBLOCK_NOMAP regions
should not be saved during hibernation.

This problem was introduced by changes to the pfn_valid() logic in
commit a7d9f306ba70 ("arm64: drop pfn_valid_within() and simplify
pfn_valid()").

Similar to other architectures, drop the !can_set_direct_map() check in
kernel_page_present() so that page_is_savable() skips such pages.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
