Subject: CVE-2024-26983: bootconfig: use memblock_free_late to free xbc memory to buddy

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bootconfig: use memblock_free_late to free xbc memory to buddy

On the time to free xbc memory in xbc_exit(), memblock may has handed
over memory to buddy allocator. So it doesn't make sense to free memory
back to memblock. memblock_free() called by xbc_exit() even causes UAF bugs
on architectures with CONFIG_ARCH_KEEP_MEMBLOCK disabled like x86.
Following KASAN logs shows this case.

This patch fixes the xbc memory free problem by calling memblock_free()
in early xbc init error rewind path and calling memblock_free_late() in
xbc exit path to free memory to buddy allocator.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
