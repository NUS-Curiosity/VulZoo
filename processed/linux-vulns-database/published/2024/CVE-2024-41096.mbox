Subject: CVE-2024-41096: PCI/MSI: Fix UAF in msi_capability_init

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI/MSI: Fix UAF in msi_capability_init

KFENCE reports the following UAF:

 BUG: KFENCE: use-after-free read in __pci_enable_msi_range+0x2c0/0x488

 Use-after-free read at 0x0000000024629571 (in kfence-#12):

Descriptor allocation done in:

                    msi_alloc_desc
                        ...

Freed in case of failure in __msi_domain_alloc_locked()
__pci_enable_msi_range
    msi_capability_init
        pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs
            msi_domain_alloc_irqs_all_locked

                    __msi_domain_alloc_locked => fails
                    msi_domain_free_locked
                        ...

That failure propagates back to pci_msi_setup_msi_irqs() in
msi_capability_init() which accesses the descriptor for unmasking in the
error exit path.

Cure it by copying the descriptor and using the copy for the error exit path
unmask operation.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
