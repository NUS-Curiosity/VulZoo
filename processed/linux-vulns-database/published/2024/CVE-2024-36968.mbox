Subject: CVE-2024-36968: Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix div-by-zero in l2cap_le_flowctl_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix div-by-zero in l2cap_le_flowctl_init()

l2cap_le_flowctl_init() can cause both div-by-zero and an integer
overflow since hdev->le_mtu may not fall in the valid range.

Move MTU from hci_dev to hci_conn to validate MTU and stop the connection
process earlier if MTU is invalid.
Also, add a missing validation in read_buffer_size() and make it return
an error value if the validation fails.
Now hci_conn_add() returns ERR_PTR() as it can fail due to the both a
kzalloc failure and invalid MTU value.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
