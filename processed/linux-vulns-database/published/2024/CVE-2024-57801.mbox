Subject: CVE-2024-57801: net/mlx5e: Skip restore TC rules for vport rep without loaded flag

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Skip restore TC rules for vport rep without loaded flag

During driver unload, unregister_netdev is called after unloading
vport rep. So, the mlx5e_rep_priv is already freed while trying to get
rpriv->netdev, or walk rpriv->tc_ht, which results in use-after-free.
So add the checking to make sure access the data of vport rep which is
still loaded.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57801 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
