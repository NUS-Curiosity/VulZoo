Subject: CVE-2024-58082: media: nuvoton: Fix an error check in npcm_video_ece_init()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: nuvoton: Fix an error check in npcm_video_ece_init()

When function of_find_device_by_node() fails, it returns NULL instead of
an error code. So the corresponding error check logic should be modified
to check whether the return value is NULL and set the error code to be
returned as -ENODEV.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58082 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
