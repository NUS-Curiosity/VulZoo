Subject: CVE-2024-58012: ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-dai: Ensure DAI widget is valid during params

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda-dai: Ensure DAI widget is valid during params

Each cpu DAI should associate with a widget. However, the topology might
not create the right number of DAI widgets for aggregated amps. And it
will cause NULL pointer deference.
Check that the DAI widget associated with the CPU DAI is valid to prevent
NULL pointer deference due to missing DAI widgets in topologies with
aggregated amps.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58012 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e012a77e4d7632cf615ba9625b1600ed8985c3b5
