Subject: CVE-2024-58086: drm/v3d: Stop active perfmon if it is being destroyed

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Stop active perfmon if it is being destroyed

If the active performance monitor (`v3d->active_perfmon`) is being
destroyed, stop it first. Currently, the active perfmon is not
stopped during destruction, leaving the `v3d->active_perfmon` pointer
stale. This can lead to undefined behavior and instability.

This patch ensures that the active perfmon is stopped before being
destroyed, aligning with the behavior introduced in commit
7d1fd3638ee3 ("drm/v3d: Stop the active perfmon before being destroyed").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58086 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
