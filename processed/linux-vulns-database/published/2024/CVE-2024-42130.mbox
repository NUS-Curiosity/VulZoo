Subject: CVE-2024-42130: nfc/nci: Add the inconsistency check between the input data length and count

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc/nci: Add the inconsistency check between the input data length and count

write$nci(r0, &(0x7f0000000740)=ANY=[@ANYBLOB="610501"], 0xf)

Syzbot constructed a write() call with a data length of 3 bytes but a count value
of 15, which passed too little data to meet the basic requirements of the function
nci_rf_intf_activated_ntf_packet().

Therefore, increasing the comparison between data length and count value to avoid
problems caused by inconsistent data length and count.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42130 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
