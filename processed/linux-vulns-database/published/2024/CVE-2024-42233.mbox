Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

filemap: replace pte_offset_map() with pte_offset_map_nolock()

The vmf->ptl in filemap_fault_recheck_pte_none() is still set from
handle_pte_fault().  But at the same time, we did a pte_unmap(vmf->pte). 
After a pte_unmap(vmf->pte) unmap and rcu_read_unlock(), the page table
may be racily changed and vmf->ptl maybe fails to protect the actual page
table.  Fix this by replacing pte_offset_map() with
pte_offset_map_nolock().

As David said, the PTL pointer might be stale so if we continue to use
it infilemap_fault_recheck_pte_none(), it might trigger UAF.  Also, if
the PTL fails, the issue fixed by commit 58f327f2ce80 ("filemap: avoid
unnecessary major faults in filemap_fault()") might reappear.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42233 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6a6c2aec1a89506595801b4cf7e8eef035f33748
