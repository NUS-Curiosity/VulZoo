Subject: CVE-2024-40909: bpf: Fix a potential use-after-free in bpf_link_free()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix a potential use-after-free in bpf_link_free()

After commit 1a80dbcb2dba, bpf_link can be freed by
link->ops->dealloc_deferred, but the code still tests and uses
link->ops->dealloc afterward, which leads to a use-after-free as
reported by syzbot. Actually, one of them should be sufficient, so
just call one of them instead of both. Also add a WARN_ON() in case
of any problematic implementation.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40909 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
