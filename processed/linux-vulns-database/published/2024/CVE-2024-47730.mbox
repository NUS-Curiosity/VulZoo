Subject: CVE-2024-47730: crypto: hisilicon/qm - inject error before stopping queue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: hisilicon/qm - inject error before stopping queue

The master ooo cannot be completely closed when the
accelerator core reports memory error. Therefore, the driver
needs to inject the qm error to close the master ooo. Currently,
the qm error is injected after stopping queue, memory may be
released immediately after stopping queue, causing the device to
access the released memory. Therefore, error is injected to close master
ooo before stopping queue to ensure that the device does not access
the released memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47730 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
