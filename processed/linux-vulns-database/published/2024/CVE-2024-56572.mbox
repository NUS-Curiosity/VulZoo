Subject: CVE-2024-56572: media: platform: allegro-dvt: Fix possible memory leak in allocate_buffers_internal()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: platform: allegro-dvt: Fix possible memory leak in allocate_buffers_internal()

The buffer in the loop should be released under the exception path,
otherwise there may be a memory leak here.

To mitigate this, free the buffer when allegro_alloc_buffer fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56572 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
