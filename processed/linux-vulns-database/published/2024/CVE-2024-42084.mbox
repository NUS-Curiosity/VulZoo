Subject: CVE-2024-42084: ftruncate: pass a signed offset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ftruncate: pass a signed offset

The old ftruncate() syscall, using the 32-bit off_t misses a sign
extension when called in compat mode on 64-bit architectures.  As a
result, passing a negative length accidentally succeeds in truncating
to file size between 2GiB and 4GiB.

Changing the type of the compat syscall to the signed compat_off_t
changes the behavior so it instead returns -EINVAL.

The native entry point, the truncate() syscall and the corresponding
loff_t based variants are all correct already and do not suffer
from this mistake.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42084 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
