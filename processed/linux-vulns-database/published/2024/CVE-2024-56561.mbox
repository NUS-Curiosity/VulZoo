Subject: CVE-2024-56561: PCI: endpoint: Fix PCI domain ID release in pci_epc_destroy()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: endpoint: Fix PCI domain ID release in pci_epc_destroy()

pci_epc_destroy() invokes pci_bus_release_domain_nr() to release the PCI
domain ID, but there are two issues:

  - 'epc->dev' is passed to pci_bus_release_domain_nr() which was already
    freed by device_unregister(), leading to a use-after-free issue.

  - Domain ID corresponds to the EPC device parent, so passing 'epc->dev'
    is also wrong.

Fix these issues by passing 'epc->dev.parent' to
pci_bus_release_domain_nr() and also do it before device_unregister().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56561 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c74a1df6c2a2df7dd45c3fc1a5edc29a075dcf22
