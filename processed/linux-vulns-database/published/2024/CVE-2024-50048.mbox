Subject: CVE-2024-50048: fbcon: Fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in fbcon_putcs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbcon: Fix a NULL pointer dereference issue in fbcon_putcs

syzbot has found a NULL pointer dereference bug in fbcon.
Here is the simplified C reproducer:

struct param {
	uint8_t type;
	struct tiocl_selection ts;
};

int main()
{
	struct fb_con2fbmap con2fb;
	struct param param;

	int fd = open("/dev/fb1", 0, 0);

	con2fb.console = 0x19;
	con2fb.framebuffer = 0;
	ioctl(fd, FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP, &con2fb);

	param.type = 2;
	param.ts.xs = 0; param.ts.ys = 0;
	param.ts.xe = 0; param.ts.ye = 0;
	param.ts.sel_mode = 0;

	int fd1 = open("/dev/tty1", O_RDWR, 0);
	ioctl(fd1, TIOCLINUX, &param);

	con2fb.console = 1;
	con2fb.framebuffer = 0;
	ioctl(fd, FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP, &con2fb);

	return 0;
}

After calling ioctl(fd1, TIOCLINUX, &param), the subsequent ioctl(fd, FBIOPUT_CON2FBMAP, &con2fb)
causes the kernel to follow a different execution path:

 set_con2fb_map
  -> con2fb_init_display
   -> fbcon_set_disp
    -> redraw_screen
     -> hide_cursor
      -> clear_selection
       -> highlight
        -> invert_screen
         -> do_update_region
          -> fbcon_putcs
           -> ops->putcs

Since ops->putcs is a NULL pointer, this leads to a kernel panic.
To prevent this, we need to call set_blitting_type() within set_con2fb_map()
to properly initialize ops->putcs.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50048 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
