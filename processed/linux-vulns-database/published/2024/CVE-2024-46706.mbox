Subject: CVE-2024-46706: tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: mark last busy before uart_add_one_port

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: mark last busy before uart_add_one_port

With "earlycon initcall_debug=1 loglevel=8" in bootargs, kernel
sometimes boot hang. It is because normal console still is not ready,
but runtime suspend is called, so early console putchar will hang
in waiting TRDE set in UARTSTAT.

The lpuart driver has auto suspend delay set to 3000ms, but during
uart_add_one_port, a child device serial ctrl will added and probed with
its pm runtime enabled(see serial_ctrl.c).
The runtime suspend call path is:
device_add
     |-> bus_probe_device
           |->device_initial_probe
	           |->__device_attach
                         |-> pm_runtime_get_sync(dev->parent);
			 |-> pm_request_idle(dev);
			 |-> pm_runtime_put(dev->parent);

So in the end, before normal console ready, the lpuart get runtime
suspended. And earlycon putchar will hang.

To address the issue, mark last busy just after pm_runtime_enable,
three seconds is long enough to switch from bootconsole to normal
console.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46706 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
