Subject: CVE-2024-26878: quota: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

quota: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

Below race may cause NULL pointer dereference

P1					P2
dquot_free_inode			quota_off
					  drop_dquot_ref
					   remove_dquot_ref
					   dquots = i_dquot(inode)
  dquots = i_dquot(inode)
  srcu_read_lock
  dquots[cnt]) != NULL (1)
					     dquots[type] = NULL (2)
  spin_lock(&dquots[cnt]->dq_dqb_lock) (3)
   ....

If dquot_free_inode(or other routines) checks inode's quota pointers (1)
before quota_off sets it to NULL(2) and use it (3) after that, NULL pointer
dereference will be triggered.

So let's fix it by using a temporary pointer to avoid this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26878 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
