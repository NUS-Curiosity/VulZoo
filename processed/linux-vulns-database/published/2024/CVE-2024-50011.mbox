Subject: CVE-2024-50011: ASoC: Intel: soc-acpi-intel-rpl-match: add missing empty item

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: soc-acpi-intel-rpl-match: add missing empty item

There is no links_num in struct snd_soc_acpi_mach {}, and we test
!link->num_adr as a condition to end the loop in hda_sdw_machine_select().
So an empty item in struct snd_soc_acpi_link_adr array is required.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50011 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
