Subject: CVE-2024-46719: usb: typec: ucsi: Fix null pointer dereference in trace

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: typec: ucsi: Fix null pointer dereference in trace

ucsi_register_altmode checks IS_ERR for the alt pointer and treats
NULL as valid. When CONFIG_TYPEC_DP_ALTMODE is not enabled,
ucsi_register_displayport returns NULL which causes a NULL pointer
dereference in trace. Rather than return NULL, call
typec_port_register_altmode to register DisplayPort alternate mode
as a non-controllable mode when CONFIG_TYPEC_DP_ALTMODE is not enabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46719 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
