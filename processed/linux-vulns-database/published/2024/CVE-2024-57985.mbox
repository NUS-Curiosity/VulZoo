Subject: CVE-2024-57985: firmware: qcom: scm: Cleanup global '__scm' on probe failures

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: qcom: scm: Cleanup global '__scm' on probe failures

If SCM driver fails the probe, it should not leave global '__scm'
variable assigned, because external users of this driver will assume the
probe finished successfully.  For example TZMEM parts ('__scm->mempool')
are initialized later in the probe, but users of it (__scm_smc_call())
rely on the '__scm' variable.

This fixes theoretical NULL pointer exception, triggered via introducing
probe deferral in SCM driver with call trace:

  qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x70/0x1ac (P)
  qcom_tzmem_alloc+0x64/0x1ac (L)
  qcom_scm_assign_mem+0x78/0x194
  qcom_rmtfs_mem_probe+0x2d4/0x38c
  platform_probe+0x68/0xc8

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57985 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
