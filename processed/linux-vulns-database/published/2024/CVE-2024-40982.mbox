Subject: CVE-2024-40982: ssb: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in ssb_device_uevent()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ssb: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in ssb_device_uevent()

The ssb_device_uevent() function first attempts to convert the 'dev' pointer
to 'struct ssb_device *'. However, it mistakenly dereferences 'dev' before
performing the NULL check, potentially leading to a NULL pointer
dereference if 'dev' is NULL.

To fix this issue, move the NULL check before dereferencing the 'dev' pointer,
ensuring that the pointer is valid before attempting to use it.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40982 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
