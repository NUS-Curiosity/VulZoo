Subject: CVE-2024-26911: drm/buddy: Fix alloc_range() error handling code

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/buddy: Fix alloc_range() error handling code

Few users have observed display corruption when they boot
the machine to KDE Plasma or playing games. We have root
caused the problem that whenever alloc_range() couldn't
find the required memory blocks the function was returning
SUCCESS in some of the corner cases.

The right approach would be if the total allocated size
is less than the required size, the function should
return -ENOSPC.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26911 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b59c3fada06e5e8010ef7700689c71986e667a2
