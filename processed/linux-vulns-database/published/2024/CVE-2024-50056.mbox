Subject: CVE-2024-50056: usb: gadget: uvc: Fix ERR_PTR dereference in uvc_v4l2.c

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: uvc: Fix ERR_PTR dereference in uvc_v4l2.c

Fix potential dereferencing of ERR_PTR() in find_format_by_pix()
and uvc_v4l2_enum_format().

Fix the following smatch errors:

drivers/usb/gadget/function/uvc_v4l2.c:124 find_format_by_pix()
error: 'fmtdesc' dereferencing possible ERR_PTR()

drivers/usb/gadget/function/uvc_v4l2.c:392 uvc_v4l2_enum_format()

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
