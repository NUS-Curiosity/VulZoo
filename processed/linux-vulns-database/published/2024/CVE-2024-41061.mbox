Subject: CVE-2024-41061: drm/amd/display: Fix array-index-out-of-bounds in dml2/FCLKChangeSupport

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix array-index-out-of-bounds in dml2/FCLKChangeSupport

[Why]
Potential out of bounds access in dml2_calculate_rq_and_dlg_params()
because the value of out_lowest_state_idx used as an index for FCLKChangeSupport
array can be greater than 1.

[How]
Currently dml2 core specifies identical values for all FCLKChangeSupport
elements. Always use index 0 in the condition to avoid out of bounds access.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41061 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
