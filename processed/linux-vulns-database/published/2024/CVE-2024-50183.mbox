Subject: CVE-2024-50183: scsi: lpfc: Ensure DA_ID handling completion before deleting an NPIV instance

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: lpfc: Ensure DA_ID handling completion before deleting an NPIV instance

Deleting an NPIV instance requires all fabric ndlps to be released before
an NPIV's resources can be torn down.  Failure to release fabric ndlps
beforehand opens kref imbalance race conditions.  Fix by forcing the DA_ID
to complete synchronously with usage of wait_queue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50183 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
