Subject: CVE-2024-26711: iio: adc: ad4130: zero-initialize clock init data

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: ad4130: zero-initialize clock init data

The clk_init_data struct does not have all its members
initialized, causing issues when trying to expose the internal
clock on the CLK pin.

Fix this by zero-initializing the clk_init_data struct.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26711 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0e0dab37750926d4fb0144edb1c1ea0612fea273
