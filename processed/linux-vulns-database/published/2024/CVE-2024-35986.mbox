Subject: CVE-2024-35986: phy: ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregistered

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phy: ti: tusb1210: Resolve charger-det crash if charger psy is unregistered

The power_supply frame-work is not really designed for there to be
long living in kernel references to power_supply devices.

Specifically unregistering a power_supply while some other code has
a reference to it triggers a WARN in power_supply_unregister():

	WARN_ON(atomic_dec_return(&psy->use_cnt));

Folllowed by the power_supply still getting removed and the
backing data freed anyway, leaving the tusb1210 charger-detect code
with a dangling reference, resulting in a crash the next time
tusb1210_get_online() is called.

Fix this by only holding the reference in tusb1210_get_online()
freeing it at the end of the function. Note this still leaves
a theoretical race window, but it avoids the issue when manually
rmmod-ing the charger chip driver during development.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35986 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
