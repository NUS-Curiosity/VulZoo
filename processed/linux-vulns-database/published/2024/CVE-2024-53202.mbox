Subject: CVE-2024-53202: firmware_loader: Fix possible resource leak in fw_log_firmware_info()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware_loader: Fix possible resource leak in fw_log_firmware_info()

The alg instance should be released under the exception path, otherwise
there may be resource leak here.

To mitigate this, free the alg instance with crypto_free_shash when kmalloc
fails.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53202 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
