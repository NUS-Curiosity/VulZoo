Subject: CVE-2024-50129: net: pse-pd: Fix out of bound for loop

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: pse-pd: Fix out of bound for loop

Adjust the loop limit to prevent out-of-bounds access when iterating over
PI structures. The loop should not reach the index pcdev->nr_lines since
we allocate exactly pcdev->nr_lines number of PI structures. This fix
ensures proper bounds are maintained during iterations.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50129 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
