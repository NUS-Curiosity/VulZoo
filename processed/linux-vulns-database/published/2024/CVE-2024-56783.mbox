Subject: CVE-2024-56783: netfilter: nft_socket: remove WARN_ON_ONCE on maximum cgroup level

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_socket: remove WARN_ON_ONCE on maximum cgroup level

cgroup maximum depth is INT_MAX by default, there is a cgroup toggle to
restrict this maximum depth to a more reasonable value not to harm
performance. Remove unnecessary WARN_ON_ONCE which is reachable from
userspace.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56783 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
