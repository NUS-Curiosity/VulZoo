Subject: CVE-2024-57879: Bluetooth: iso: Always release hdev at the end of iso_listen_bis

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: iso: Always release hdev at the end of iso_listen_bis

Since hci_get_route holds the device before returning, the hdev
should be released with hci_dev_put at the end of iso_listen_bis
even if the function returns with an error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57879 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
