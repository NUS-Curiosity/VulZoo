Subject: CVE-2024-44942: f2fs: fix to do sanity check on F2FS_INLINE_DATA flag in inode during GC

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to do sanity check on F2FS_INLINE_DATA flag in inode during GC

syzbot reports a f2fs bug as below:

The root cause is: inline_data inode can be fuzzed, so that there may
be valid blkaddr in its direct node, once f2fs triggers background GC
to migrate the block, it will hit f2fs_bug_on() during dirty page
writeback.

Let's add sanity check on F2FS_INLINE_DATA flag in inode during GC,
so that, it can forbid migrating inline_data inode's data block for
fixing.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44942 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ae00e6536a2dd54b64b39e9a39548870cf835745
