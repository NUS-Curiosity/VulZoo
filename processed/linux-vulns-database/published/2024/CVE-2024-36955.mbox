Subject: CVE-2024-36955: ALSA: hda: intel-sdw-acpi: fix usage of device_get_named_child_node()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: hda: intel-sdw-acpi: fix usage of device_get_named_child_node()

The documentation for device_get_named_child_node() mentions this
important point:

"
The caller is responsible for calling fwnode_handle_put() on the
returned fwnode pointer.
"

Add fwnode_handle_put() to avoid a leaked reference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36955 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
