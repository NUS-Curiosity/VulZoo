Subject: CVE-2024-42137: Bluetooth: qca: Fix BT enable failure again for QCA6390 after warm reboot

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: qca: Fix BT enable failure again for QCA6390 after warm reboot

Commit 272970be3dab ("Bluetooth: hci_qca: Fix driver shutdown on closed
serdev") will cause below regression issue:

BT can't be enabled after below steps:
cold boot -> enable BT -> disable BT -> warm reboot -> BT enable failure
if property enable-gpios is not configured within DT|ACPI for QCA6390.

The commit is to fix a use-after-free issue within qca_serdev_shutdown()
by adding condition to avoid the serdev is flushed or wrote after closed
but also introduces this regression issue regarding above steps since the
VSC is not sent to reset controller during warm reboot.

Fixed by sending the VSC to reset controller within qca_serdev_shutdown()
once BT was ever enabled, and the use-after-free issue is also fixed by
this change since the serdev is still opened before it is flushed or wrote.

Verified by the reported machine Dell XPS 13 9310 laptop over below two
kernel commits:
commit e00fc2700a3f ("Bluetooth: btusb: Fix triggering coredump
implementation for QCA") of bluetooth-next tree.
commit b23d98d46d28 ("Bluetooth: btusb: Fix triggering coredump
implementation for QCA") of linus mainline tree.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42137 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
