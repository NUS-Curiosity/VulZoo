Subject: CVE-2024-36944: Reapply "drm/qxl: simplify qxl_fence_wait"

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Reapply "drm/qxl: simplify qxl_fence_wait"

This reverts commit 07ed11afb68d94eadd4ffc082b97c2331307c5ea.

Stephen Rostedt reports:
 "I went to run my tests on my VMs and the tests hung on boot up.
  Unfortunately, the most I ever got out was:

  [   93.607888] Testing event system initcall: OK
  [   93.667730] Running tests on all trace events:
  [   93.669757] Testing all events: OK
  [   95.631064] ------------[ cut here ]------------
  Timed out after 60 seconds"

and further debugging points to a possible circular locking dependency
between the console_owner locking and the worker pool locking.

Reverting the commit allows Steve's VM to boot to completion again.

[ This may obviously result in the "[TTM] Buffer eviction failed"
  messages again, which was the reason for that original revert. But at
  this point this seems preferable to a non-booting system... ]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36944 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
