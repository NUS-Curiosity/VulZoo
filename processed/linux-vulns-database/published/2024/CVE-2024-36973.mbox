Subject: CVE-2024-36973: misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: fix double free in the error handling of gp_aux_bus_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: microchip: pci1xxxx: fix double free in the error handling of gp_aux_bus_probe()

When auxiliary_device_add() returns error and then calls
auxiliary_device_uninit(), callback function
gp_auxiliary_device_release() calls ida_free() and
kfree(aux_device_wrapper) to free memory. We should't
call them again in the error handling path.

Fix this by skipping the redundant cleanup functions.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36973 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
