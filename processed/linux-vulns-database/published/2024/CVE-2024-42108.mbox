Subject: CVE-2024-42108: net: rswitch: Avoid use-after-free in rswitch_poll()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: rswitch: Avoid use-after-free in rswitch_poll()

The use-after-free is actually in rswitch_tx_free(), which is inlined in
rswitch_poll(). Since `skb` and `gq->skbs[gq->dirty]` are in fact the
same pointer, the skb is first freed using dev_kfree_skb_any(), then the
value in skb->len is used to update the interface statistics.

Let's move around the instructions to use skb->len before the skb is
freed.

This bug is trivial to reproduce using KFENCE. It will trigger a splat
every few packets. A simple ARP request or ICMP echo request is enough.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42108 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Issue introduced in 6.8 with commit 271e015b9153 and fixed in 6.9.9 with commit 92cbbe775919

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
