Subject: CVE-2024-26880: dm: call the resume method on internal suspend

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dm: call the resume method on internal suspend

There is this reported crash when experimenting with the lvm2 testsuite.
The list corruption is caused by the fact that the postsuspend and resume
methods were not paired correctly; there were two consecutive calls to the
origin_postsuspend function. The second call attempts to remove the
"hash_list" entry from a list, while it was already removed by the first
call.

Fix __dm_internal_resume so that it calls the preresume and resume
methods of the table's targets.

If a preresume method of some target fails, we are in a tricky situation.
We can't return an error because dm_internal_resume isn't supposed to
return errors. We can't return success, because then the "resume" and
"postsuspend" methods would not be paired correctly. So, we set the
DMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspace
tools, but it won't cause a kernel crash.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
