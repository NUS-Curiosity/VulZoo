Subject: CVE-2024-53200: drm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in hwss_setup_dpp

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix null check for pipe_ctx->plane_state in hwss_setup_dpp

This commit addresses a null pointer dereference issue in
hwss_setup_dpp(). The issue could occur when pipe_ctx->plane_state is
null. The fix adds a check to ensure `pipe_ctx->plane_state` is not null
before accessing. This prevents a null pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53200 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
