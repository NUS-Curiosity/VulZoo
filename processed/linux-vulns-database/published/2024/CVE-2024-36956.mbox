Subject: CVE-2024-36956: thermal/debugfs: Free all thermal zone debug memory on zone removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal/debugfs: Free all thermal zone debug memory on zone removal

Because thermal_debug_tz_remove() does not free all memory allocated for
thermal zone diagnostics, some of that memory becomes unreachable after
freeing the thermal zone's struct thermal_debugfs object.

Address this by making thermal_debug_tz_remove() free all of the memory
in question.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
