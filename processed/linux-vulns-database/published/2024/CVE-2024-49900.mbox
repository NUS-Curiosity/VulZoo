Subject: CVE-2024-49900: jfs: Fix uninit-value access of new_ea in ea_buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: Fix uninit-value access of new_ea in ea_buffer

syzbot reports that lzo1x_1_do_compress is using uninit-value:

=====================================================
BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in lzo1x_1_do_compress+0x19f9/0x2510 lib/lzo/lzo1x_compress.c:178

...

Uninit was stored to memory at:
 ea_put fs/jfs/xattr.c:639 [inline]

...

Local variable ea_buf created at:
 __jfs_setxattr+0x5d/0x1ae0 fs/jfs/xattr.c:662
 __jfs_xattr_set+0xe6/0x1f0 fs/jfs/xattr.c:934

=====================================================

The reason is ea_buf->new_ea is not initialized properly.

Fix this by using memset to empty its content at the beginning
in ea_get().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49900 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
