Subject: CVE-2024-50302: HID: core: zero-initialize the report buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: core: zero-initialize the report buffer

Since the report buffer is used by all kinds of drivers in various ways, let's
zero-initialize it during allocation to make sure that it can't be ever used
to leak kernel memory via specially-crafted report.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50302 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
