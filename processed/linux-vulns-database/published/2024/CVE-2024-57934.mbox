Subject: CVE-2024-57934: fgraph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fgraph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]

In __ftrace_return_to_handler(), a loop iterates over the fgraph_array[]
elements, which are fgraph_ops. The loop checks if an element is a
fgraph_stub to prevent using a fgraph_stub afterward.

However, if the compiler reloads fgraph_array[] after this check, it might
race with an update to fgraph_array[] that introduces a fgraph_stub. This
could result in the stub being processed, but the stub contains a null
"func_hash" field, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

To ensure that the gops compared against the fgraph_stub matches the gops
processed later, add a READ_ONCE(). A similar patch appears in commit
63a8dfb ("function_graph: Add READ_ONCE() when accessing fgraph_array[]").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57934 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b68b2a3fbacc7be720ef589d489bcacdd05c6d38
