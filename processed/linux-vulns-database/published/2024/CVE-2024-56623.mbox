Subject: CVE-2024-56623: scsi: qla2xxx: Fix use after free on unload

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: qla2xxx: Fix use after free on unload

System crash is observed with stack trace warning of use after
free. There are 2 signals to tell dpc_thread to terminate (UNLOADING
flag and kthread_stop).

On setting the UNLOADING flag when dpc_thread happens to run at the time
and sees the flag, this causes dpc_thread to exit and clean up
itself. When kthread_stop is called for final cleanup, this causes use
after free.

Remove UNLOADING signal to terminate dpc_thread.  Use the kthread_stop
as the main signal to exit dpc_thread.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
