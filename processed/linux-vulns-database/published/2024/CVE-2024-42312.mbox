Subject: CVE-2024-42312: sysctl: always initialize i_uid/i_gid

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sysctl: always initialize i_uid/i_gid

Always initialize i_uid/i_gid inside the sysfs core so set_ownership()
can safely skip setting them.

Commit 5ec27ec735ba ("fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c: fix the default values of
i_uid/i_gid on /proc/sys inodes.") added defaults for i_uid/i_gid when
set_ownership() was not implemented. It also missed adjusting
net_ctl_set_ownership() to use the same default values in case the
computation of a better value failed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42312 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
