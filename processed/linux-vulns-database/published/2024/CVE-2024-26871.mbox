Subject: CVE-2024-26871: f2fs: fix NULL pointer dereference in f2fs_submit_page_write()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix NULL pointer dereference in f2fs_submit_page_write()

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000014
RIP: 0010:f2fs_submit_page_write+0x6cf/0x780 [f2fs]

...
It is possible that other threads have added this fio to io->bio
and submitted the io->bio before entering f2fs_submit_page_write().
At this point io->bio = NULL.
If is_end_zone_blkaddr(sbi, fio->new_blkaddr) of this fio is true,
then an NULL pointer dereference error occurs at bio_get(io->bio).
The original code for determining zone end was after "out:",
which would have missed some fio who is zone end. I've moved
 this code before "skip:" to make sure it's done for each fio.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26871 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
