Subject: CVE-2024-40972: ext4: do not create EA inode under buffer lock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: do not create EA inode under buffer lock

ext4_xattr_set_entry() creates new EA inodes while holding buffer lock
on the external xattr block. This is problematic as it nests all the
allocation locking (which acquires locks on other buffers) under the
buffer lock. This can even deadlock when the filesystem is corrupted and
e.g. quota file is setup to contain xattr block as data block. Move the
allocation of EA inode out of ext4_xattr_set_entry() into the callers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40972 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
