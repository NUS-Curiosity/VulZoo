Subject: CVE-2024-44939: jfs: fix null ptr deref in dtInsertEntry

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

jfs: fix null ptr deref in dtInsertEntry

[syzbot reported]
general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000001: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI
KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000008-0x000000000000000f]
CPU: 0 PID: 5061 Comm: syz-executor404 Not tainted 6.8.0-syzkaller-08951-gfe46a7dd189e #0
Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS Google 03/27/2024
RIP: 0010:dtInsertEntry+0xd0c/0x1780 fs/jfs/jfs_dtree.c:3713
...
[Analyze]
In dtInsertEntry(), when the pointer h has the same value as p, after writing
name in UniStrncpy_to_le(), p->header.flag will be cleared. This will cause the
previously true judgment "p->header.flag & BT-LEAF" to change to no after writing
the name operation, this leads to entering an incorrect branch and accessing the
uninitialized object ih when judging this condition for the second time.

[Fix]
After got the page, check freelist first, if freelist == 0 then exit dtInsert()
and return -EINVAL.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44939 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
