Subject: CVE-2024-26637: wifi: ath11k: rely on mac80211 debugfs handling for vif

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath11k: rely on mac80211 debugfs handling for vif

mac80211 started to delete debugfs entries in certain cases, causing a
ath11k to crash when it tried to delete the entries later. Fix this by
relying on mac80211 to delete the entries when appropriate and adding
them from the vif_add_debugfs handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26637 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
