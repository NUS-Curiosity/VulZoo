Subject: CVE-2024-58052: drm/amdgpu: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in atomctrl_get_smc_sclk_range_table

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference in atomctrl_get_smc_sclk_range_table

The function atomctrl_get_smc_sclk_range_table() does not check the return
value of smu_atom_get_data_table(). If smu_atom_get_data_table() fails to
retrieve SMU_Info table, it returns NULL which is later dereferenced.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

In practice this should never happen as this code only gets called
on polaris chips and the vbios data table will always be present on
those chips.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58052 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
