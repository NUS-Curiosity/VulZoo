Subject: CVE-2024-58010: binfmt_flat: Fix integer overflow bug on 32 bit systems

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

binfmt_flat: Fix integer overflow bug on 32 bit systems

Most of these sizes and counts are capped at 256MB so the math doesn't
result in an integer overflow.  The "relocs" count needs to be checked
as well.  Otherwise on 32bit systems the calculation of "full_data"
could be wrong.

	full_data = data_len + relocs * sizeof(unsigned long);

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58010 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
