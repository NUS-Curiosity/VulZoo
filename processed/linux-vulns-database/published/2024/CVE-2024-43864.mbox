Subject: CVE-2024-43864: net/mlx5e: Fix CT entry update leaks of modify header context

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: Fix CT entry update leaks of modify header context

The cited commit allocates a new modify header to replace the old
one when updating CT entry. But if failed to allocate a new one, eg.
exceed the max number firmware can support, modify header will be
an error pointer that will trigger a panic when deallocating it. And
the old modify header point is copied to old attr. When the old
attr is freed, the old modify header is lost.

Fix it by restoring the old attr to attr when failed to allocate a
new modify header context. So when the CT entry is freed, the right
modify header context will be freed. And the panic of accessing
error pointer is also fixed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43864 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
