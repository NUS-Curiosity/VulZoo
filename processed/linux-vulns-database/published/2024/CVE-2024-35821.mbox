Subject: CVE-2024-35821: ubifs: Set page uptodate in the correct place

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ubifs: Set page uptodate in the correct place

Page cache reads are lockless, so setting the freshly allocated page
uptodate before we've overwritten it with the data it's supposed to have
in it will allow a simultaneous reader to see old data.  Move the call
to SetPageUptodate into ubifs_write_end(), which is after we copied the
new data into the page.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35821 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
