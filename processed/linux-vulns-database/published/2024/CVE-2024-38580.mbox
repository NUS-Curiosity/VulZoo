Subject: CVE-2024-38580: epoll: be better about file lifetimes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

epoll: be better about file lifetimes

epoll can call out to vfs_poll() with a file pointer that may race with
the last 'fput()'. That would make f_count go down to zero, and while
the ep->mtx locking means that the resulting file pointer tear-down will
be blocked until the poll returns, it means that f_count is already
dead, and any use of it won't actually get a reference to the file any
more: it's dead regardless.

Make sure we have a valid ref on the file pointer before we call down to
vfs_poll() from the epoll routines.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38580 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
