Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mmc: sdhci: Fix max_seg_size for 64KiB PAGE_SIZE

blk_queue_max_segment_size() ensured:

	if (max_size < PAGE_SIZE)
		max_size = PAGE_SIZE;

whereas:

blk_validate_limits() makes it an error:

	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(lim->max_segment_size < PAGE_SIZE))
		return -EINVAL;

The change from one to the other, exposed sdhci which was setting maximum
segment size too low in some circumstances.

Fix the maximum segment size when it is too low.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42242 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
