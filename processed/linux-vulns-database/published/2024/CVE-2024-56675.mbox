Subject: CVE-2024-56675: bpf: Fix UAF via mismatching bpf_prog/attachment RCU flavors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix UAF via mismatching bpf_prog/attachment RCU flavors

Uprobes always use bpf_prog_run_array_uprobe() under tasks-trace-RCU
protection. But it is possible to attach a non-sleepable BPF program to a
uprobe, and non-sleepable BPF programs are freed via normal RCU (see
__bpf_prog_put_noref()). This leads to UAF of the bpf_prog because a normal
RCU grace period does not imply a tasks-trace-RCU grace period.

Fix it by explicitly waiting for a tasks-trace-RCU grace period after
removing the attachment of a bpf_prog to a perf_event.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56675 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
