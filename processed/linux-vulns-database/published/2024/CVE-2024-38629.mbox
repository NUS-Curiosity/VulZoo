Subject: CVE-2024-38629: dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dmaengine: idxd: Avoid unnecessary destruction of file_ida

file_ida is allocated during cdev open and is freed accordingly
during cdev release. This sequence is guaranteed by driver file
operations. Therefore, there is no need to destroy an already empty
file_ida when the WQ cdev is removed.

Worse, ida_free() in cdev release may happen after destruction of
file_ida per WQ cdev. This can lead to accessing an id in file_ida
after it has been destroyed, resulting in a kernel panic.

Remove ida_destroy(&file_ida) to address these issues.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38629 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
