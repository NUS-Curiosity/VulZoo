Subject: CVE-2024-27002: clk: mediatek: Do a runtime PM get on controllers during probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

clk: mediatek: Do a runtime PM get on controllers during probe

mt8183-mfgcfg has a mutual dependency with genpd during the probing
stage, which leads to a deadlock in the following call stack:

CPU0:  genpd_lock --> clk_prepare_lock
genpd_power_off_work_fn()
 genpd_lock()
 generic_pm_domain::power_off()
    clk_unprepare()
      clk_prepare_lock()

CPU1: clk_prepare_lock --> genpd_lock
clk_register()
  __clk_core_init()
    clk_prepare_lock()
    clk_pm_runtime_get()
      genpd_lock()

Do a runtime PM get at the probe function to make sure clk_register()
won't acquire the genpd lock. Instead of only modifying mt8183-mfgcfg,
do this on all mediatek clock controller probings because we don't
believe this would cause any regression.

Verified on MT8183 and MT8192 Chromebooks.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27002 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
