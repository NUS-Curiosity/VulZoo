Subject: CVE-2024-26964: usb: xhci: Add error handling in xhci_map_urb_for_dma

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: xhci: Add error handling in xhci_map_urb_for_dma

Currently xhci_map_urb_for_dma() creates a temporary buffer and copies
the SG list to the new linear buffer. But if the kzalloc_node() fails,
then the following sg_pcopy_to_buffer() can lead to crash since it
tries to memcpy to NULL pointer.

So return -ENOMEM if kzalloc returns null pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26964 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
