Subject: CVE-2024-56560: slab: Fix too strict alignment check in create_cache()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

slab: Fix too strict alignment check in create_cache()

On m68k, where the minimum alignment of unsigned long is 2 bytes:

    Kernel panic - not syncing: __kmem_cache_create_args: Failed to create slab 'io_kiocb'. Error -22

The minimal alignment of an integral type may differ from its size,
hence is not safe to assume that an arbitrary freeptr_t (which is
basically an unsigned long) is always aligned to 4 or 8 bytes.

As nothing seems to require the additional alignment, it is safe to fix
this by relaxing the check to the actual minimum alignment of freeptr_t.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56560 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8b5aea5e5186733fa4e5aa4293b0a65a933f1a16
