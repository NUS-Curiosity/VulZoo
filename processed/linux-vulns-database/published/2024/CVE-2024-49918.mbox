Subject: CVE-2024-49918: drm/amd/display: Add null check for head_pipe in dcn32_acquire_idle_pipe_for_head_pipe_in_layer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Add null check for head_pipe in dcn32_acquire_idle_pipe_for_head_pipe_in_layer

This commit addresses a potential null pointer dereference issue in the
`dcn32_acquire_idle_pipe_for_head_pipe_in_layer` function. The issue
could occur when `head_pipe` is null.

The fix adds a check to ensure `head_pipe` is not null before asserting
it. If `head_pipe` is null, the function returns NULL to prevent a
potential null pointer dereference.

Reported by smatch:
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/resource/dcn32/dcn32_resource.c:2690 dcn32_acquire_idle_pipe_for_head_pipe_in_layer() error: we previously assumed 'head_pipe' could be null (see line 2681)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49918 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4f47292f488fa7041284dca1f1244116c18721f1
