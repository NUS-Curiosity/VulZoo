Subject: CVE-2024-35855: mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix possible use-after-free during activity update

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix possible use-after-free during activity update

The rule activity update delayed work periodically traverses the list of
configured rules and queries their activity from the device.

As part of this task it accesses the entry pointed by 'ventry->entry',
but this entry can be changed concurrently by the rehash delayed work,
leading to a use-after-free [1].

Fix by closing the race and perform the activity query under the
'vregion->lock' mutex.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
