Subject: CVE-2024-58084: firmware: qcom: scm: Fix missing read barrier in qcom_scm_get_tzmem_pool()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: qcom: scm: Fix missing read barrier in qcom_scm_get_tzmem_pool()

Commit 2e4955167ec5 ("firmware: qcom: scm: Fix __scm and waitq
completion variable initialization") introduced a write barrier in probe
function to store global '__scm' variable.  We all known barriers are
paired (see memory-barriers.txt: "Note that write barriers should
normally be paired with read or address-dependency barriers"), therefore
accessing it from concurrent contexts requires read barrier.  Previous
commit added such barrier in qcom_scm_is_available(), so let's use that
directly.

Lack of this read barrier can result in fetching stale '__scm' variable
value, NULL, and dereferencing it.

Note that barrier in qcom_scm_is_available() satisfies here the control
dependency.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58084 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/fee921e3c641f64185abee83f9a6e65f0b380682
