Subject: CVE-2024-56657: ALSA: control: Avoid WARN() for symlink errors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: control: Avoid WARN() for symlink errors

Using WARN() for showing the error of symlink creations don't give
more information than telling that something goes wrong, since the
usual code path is a lregister callback from each control element
creation.  More badly, the use of WARN() rather confuses fuzzer as if
it were serious issues.

This patch downgrades the warning messages to use the normal dev_err()
instead of WARN().  For making it clearer, add the function name to
the prefix, too.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56657 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d5a1ca7b59804d6779644001a878ed925a4688ca
