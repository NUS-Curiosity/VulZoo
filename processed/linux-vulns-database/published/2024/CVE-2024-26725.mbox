Subject: CVE-2024-26725: dpll: fix possible deadlock during netlink dump operation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dpll: fix possible deadlock during netlink dump operation

Recently, I've been hitting following deadlock warning during dpll pin
dump:

               other info that might help us debug this:

[52804.661077]  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

[52804.661671]        CPU0                    CPU1
[52804.662129]        ----                    ----
[52804.662577]   lock(dpll_lock);
[52804.662924]                                lock(nlk_cb_mutex-GENERIC);
[52804.663538]                                lock(dpll_lock);
[52804.664073]   lock(nlk_cb_mutex-GENERIC);
[52804.664490]

The issue as follows: __netlink_dump_start() calls control->start(cb)
with nlk->cb_mutex held. In control->start(cb) the dpll_lock is taken.
Then nlk->cb_mutex is released and taken again in netlink_dump(), while
dpll_lock still being held. That leads to ABBA deadlock when another
CPU races with the same operation.

Fix this by moving dpll_lock taking into dumpit() callback which ensures
correct lock taking order.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26725 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
