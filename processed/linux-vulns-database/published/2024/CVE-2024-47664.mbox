Subject: CVE-2024-47664: spi: hisi-kunpeng: Add verification for the max_frequency provided by the firmware

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

spi: hisi-kunpeng: Add verification for the max_frequency provided by the firmware

If the value of max_speed_hz is 0, it may cause a division by zero
error in hisi_calc_effective_speed().
The value of max_speed_hz is provided by firmware.
Firmware is generally considered as a trusted domain. However, as
division by zero errors can cause system failure, for defense measure,
the value of max_speed is validated here. So 0 is regarded as invalid
and an error code is returned.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47664 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/16ccaf581da4fcf1e4d66086cf37263f9a656d43
