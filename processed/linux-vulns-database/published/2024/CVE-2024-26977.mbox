Subject: CVE-2024-26977: pci_iounmap(): Fix MMIO mapping leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pci_iounmap(): Fix MMIO mapping leak

The #ifdef ARCH_HAS_GENERIC_IOPORT_MAP accidentally also guards iounmap(),
which means MMIO mappings are leaked.

Move the guard so we call iounmap() for MMIO mappings.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26977 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
