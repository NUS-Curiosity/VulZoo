Subject: CVE-2024-42271: net/iucv: fix use after free in iucv_sock_close()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/iucv: fix use after free in iucv_sock_close()

iucv_sever_path() is called from process context and from bh context.
iucv->path is used as indicator whether somebody else is taking care of
severing the path (or it is already removed / never existed).
This needs to be done with atomic compare and swap, otherwise there is a
small window where iucv_sock_close() will try to work with a path that has
already been severed and freed by iucv_callback_connrej() called by
iucv_tasklet_fn().

[452744.125325] Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception in interrupt

Note that bh_lock_sock() is not serializing the tasklet context against
process context, because the check for sock_owned_by_user() and
corresponding handling is missing.

Ideas for a future clean-up patch:
A) Correct usage of bh_lock_sock() in tasklet context, as described in
Re-enqueue, if needed. This may require adding return values to the
tasklet functions and thus changes to all users of iucv.

B) Change iucv tasklet into worker and use only lock_sock() in af_iucv.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42271 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
