Subject: CVE-2024-53233: unicode: Fix utf8_load() error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

unicode: Fix utf8_load() error path

utf8_load() requests the symbol "utf8_data_table" and then checks if the
requested UTF-8 version is supported. If it's unsupported, it tries to
put the data table using symbol_put(). If an unsupported version is
requested, symbol_put() fails like this:

 kernel BUG at kernel/module/main.c:786!
 RIP: 0010:__symbol_put+0x93/0xb0
 Call Trace:
  <TASK>
  ? __die_body.cold+0x19/0x27
  ? die+0x2e/0x50
  ? do_trap+0xca/0x110
  ? do_error_trap+0x65/0x80

  ? __symbol_put+0x93/0xb0
  ? __symbol_put+0x62/0xb0
  utf8_load+0xf8/0x150

That happens because symbol_put() expects the unique string that
identify the symbol, instead of a pointer to the loaded symbol. Fix that
by using such string.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53233 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
