Subject: CVE-2024-44953: scsi: ufs: core: Fix deadlock during RTC update

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Fix deadlock during RTC update

There is a deadlock when runtime suspend waits for the flush of RTC work,
and the RTC work calls ufshcd_rpm_get_sync() to wait for runtime resume.

Here is deadlock backtrace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a4921b76bc9421d3838e167f6a17ea3112d8fe62
