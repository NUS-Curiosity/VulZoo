Subject: CVE-2024-36966: erofs: reliably distinguish block based and fscache mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

erofs: reliably distinguish block based and fscache mode

When erofs_kill_sb() is called in block dev based mode, s_bdev may not
have been initialised yet, and if CONFIG_EROFS_FS_ONDEMAND is enabled,
it will be mistaken for fscache mode, and then attempt to free an anon_dev
that has never been allocated, triggering the following warning:

============================================
ida_free called for id=0 which is not allocated.
WARNING: CPU: 14 PID: 926 at lib/idr.c:525 ida_free+0x134/0x140
Modules linked in:
CPU: 14 PID: 926 Comm: mount Not tainted 6.9.0-rc3-dirty #630
RIP: 0010:ida_free+0x134/0x140
Call Trace:

 [...]
============================================

Now when erofs_kill_sb() is called, erofs_sb_info must have been
initialised, so use sbi->fsid to distinguish between the two modes.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36966 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
