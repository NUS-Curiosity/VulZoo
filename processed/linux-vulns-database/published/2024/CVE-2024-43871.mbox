Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

devres: Fix memory leakage caused by driver API devm_free_percpu()

It will cause memory leakage when use driver API devm_free_percpu()
to free memory allocated by devm_alloc_percpu(), fixed by using
devres_release() instead of devres_destroy() within devm_free_percpu().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43871 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
