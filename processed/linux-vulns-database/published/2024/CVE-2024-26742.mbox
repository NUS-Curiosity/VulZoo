Subject: CVE-2024-26742: scsi: smartpqi: Fix disable_managed_interrupts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: smartpqi: Fix disable_managed_interrupts

Correct blk-mq registration issue with module parameter
disable_managed_interrupts enabled.

When we turn off the default PCI_IRQ_AFFINITY flag, the driver needs to
register with blk-mq using blk_mq_map_queues(). The driver is currently
calling blk_mq_pci_map_queues() which results in a stack trace and possibly
undefined behavior.

Stack Trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
