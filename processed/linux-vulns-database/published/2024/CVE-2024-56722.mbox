Subject: CVE-2024-56722: RDMA/hns: Fix cpu stuck caused by printings during reset

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/hns: Fix cpu stuck caused by printings during reset

During reset, cmd to destroy resources such as qp, cq, and mr may fail,
and error logs will be printed. When a large number of resources are
destroyed, there will be lots of printings, and it may lead to a cpu
stuck.

Delete some unnecessary printings and replace other printing functions
in these paths with the ratelimited version.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56722 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
