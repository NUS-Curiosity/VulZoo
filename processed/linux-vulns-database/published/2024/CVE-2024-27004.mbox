The first thread is walking the clk tree and calling
clk_pm_runtime_get() to power on devices required to read the clk
hardware via struct clk_ops::is_enabled(). This thread holds the clk
prepare_lock, and is trying to runtime PM resume a device, when it finds
that the device is in the process of resuming so the thread schedule()s
away waiting for the device to finish resuming before continuing. The
second thread is runtime PM resuming the same device, but the runtime
resume callback is calling clk_prepare(), trying to grab the
prepare_lock waiting on the first thread.

This is a classic ABBA deadlock. To properly fix the deadlock, we must
never runtime PM resume or suspend a device with the clk prepare_lock
held. Actually doing that is near impossible today because the global
prepare_lock would have to be dropped in the middle of the tree, the
device runtime PM resumed/suspended, and then the prepare_lock grabbed
again to ensure consistency of the clk tree topology. If anything
changes with the clk tree in the meantime, we've lost and will need to
start the operation all over again.

Luckily, most of the time we're simply incrementing or decrementing the
runtime PM count on an active device, so we don't have the chance to
schedule away with the prepare_lock held. Let's fix this immediate
problem that can be triggered more easily by simply booting on Qualcomm
sc7180.

Introduce a list of clk_core structures that have been registered, or
are in the process of being registered, that require runtime PM to
operate. Iterate this list and call clk_pm_runtime_get() on each of them
without holding the prepare_lock during clk_disable_unused(). This way
we can be certain that the runtime PM state of the devices will be
active and resumed so we can't schedule away while walking the clk tree
with the prepare_lock held. Similarly, call clk_pm_runtime_put() without
the prepare_lock held to properly drop the runtime PM reference. We
remove the calls to clk_pm_runtime_{get,put}() in this path because
they're superfluous now that we know the devices are runtime resumed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27004 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
