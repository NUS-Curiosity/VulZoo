Subject: CVE-2024-47708: netkit: Assign missing bpf_net_context

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netkit: Assign missing bpf_net_context

During the introduction of struct bpf_net_context handling for
XDP-redirect, the netkit driver has been missed, which also requires it
because NETKIT_REDIRECT invokes skb_do_redirect() which is accessing the
per-CPU variables. Otherwise we see the following crash:

	BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000038
	bpf_redirect()
	netkit_xmit()
	dev_hard_start_xmit()

Set the bpf_net_context before invoking netkit_xmit() program within the
netkit driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47708 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
