Subject: CVE-2024-53068: firmware: arm_scmi: Fix slab-use-after-free in scmi_bus_notifier()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

firmware: arm_scmi: Fix slab-use-after-free in scmi_bus_notifier()

The scmi_dev->name is released prematurely in __scmi_device_destroy(),
which causes slab-use-after-free when accessing scmi_dev->name in
scmi_bus_notifier(). So move the release of scmi_dev->name to
scmi_device_release() to avoid slab-use-after-free.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
