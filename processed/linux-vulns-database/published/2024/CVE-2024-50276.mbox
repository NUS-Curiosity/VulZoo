Subject: CVE-2024-50276: net: vertexcom: mse102x: Fix possible double free of TX skb

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: vertexcom: mse102x: Fix possible double free of TX skb

The scope of the TX skb is wider than just mse102x_tx_frame_spi(),
so in case the TX skb room needs to be expanded, we should free the
the temporary skb instead of the original skb. Otherwise the original
TX skb pointer would be freed again in mse102x_tx_work(), which leads
to crashes:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
