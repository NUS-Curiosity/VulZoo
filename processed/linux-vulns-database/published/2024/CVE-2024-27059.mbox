Subject: CVE-2024-27059: USB: usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: usb-storage: Prevent divide-by-0 error in isd200_ata_command

The isd200 sub-driver in usb-storage uses the HEADS and SECTORS values
in the ATA ID information to calculate cylinder and head values when
creating a CDB for READ or WRITE commands.  The calculation involves
division and modulus operations, which will cause a crash if either of
these values is 0.  While this never happens with a genuine device, it
could happen with a flawed or subversive emulation, as reported by the
syzbot fuzzer.

Protect against this possibility by refusing to bind to the device if
either the ATA_ID_HEADS or ATA_ID_SECTORS value in the device's ID
information is 0.  This requires isd200_Initialization() to return a
negative error code when initialization fails; currently it always
returns 0 (even when there is an error).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27059 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
