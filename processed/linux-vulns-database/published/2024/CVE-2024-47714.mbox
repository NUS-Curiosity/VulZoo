Subject: CVE-2024-47714: wifi: mt76: mt7996: use hweight16 to get correct tx antenna

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7996: use hweight16 to get correct tx antenna

The chainmask is u16 so using hweight8 cannot get correct tx_ant.
Without this patch, the tx_ant of band 2 would be -1 and lead to the
following issue:
BUG: KASAN: stack-out-of-bounds in mt7996_mcu_add_sta+0x12e0/0x16e0 [mt7996e]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47714 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
