Subject: CVE-2024-44995: net: hns3: fix a deadlock problem when config TC during resetting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: fix a deadlock problem when config TC during resetting

When config TC during the reset process, may cause a deadlock, the flow is
as below:
                             pf reset start
                                 │
                                 ▼
                              ......
setup tc                         │
    │                            ▼
    ▼                      DOWN: napi_disable()
napi_disable()(skip)             │
    │                            │
    ▼                            ▼
  ......                      ......
    │                            │
    ▼                            │
napi_enable()                    │
                                 ▼
                           UINIT: netif_napi_del()
                                 │
                                 ▼
                              ......
                                 │
                                 ▼
                           INIT: netif_napi_add()
                                 │
                                 ▼
                              ......                 global reset start
                                 │                      │
                                 ▼                      ▼
                           UP: napi_enable()(skip)    ......
                                 │                      │
                                 ▼                      ▼
                              ......                 napi_disable()

In reset process, the driver will DOWN the port and then UINIT, in this
case, the setup tc process will UP the port before UINIT, so cause the
problem. Adds a DOWN process in UINIT to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44995 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
