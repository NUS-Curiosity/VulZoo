Subject: CVE-2024-44985: ipv6: prevent possible UAF in ip6_xmit()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: prevent possible UAF in ip6_xmit()

If skb_expand_head() returns NULL, skb has been freed
and the associated dst/idev could also have been freed.

We must use rcu_read_lock() to prevent a possible UAF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44985 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
