Subject: CVE-2024-53690: nilfs2: prevent use of deleted inode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: prevent use of deleted inode

syzbot reported a WARNING in nilfs_rmdir. [1]

Because the inode bitmap is corrupted, an inode with an inode number that
should exist as a ".nilfs" file was reassigned by nilfs_mkdir for "file0",
causing an inode duplication during execution.  And this causes an
underflow of i_nlink in rmdir operations.

The inode is used twice by the same task to unmount and remove directories
".nilfs" and "file0", it trigger warning in nilfs_rmdir.

Avoid to this issue, check i_nlink in nilfs_iget(), if it is 0, it means
that this inode has been deleted, and iput is executed to reclaim it.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
