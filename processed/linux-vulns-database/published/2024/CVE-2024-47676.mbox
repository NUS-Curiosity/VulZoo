Subject: CVE-2024-47676: mm/hugetlb.c: fix UAF of vma in hugetlb fault pathway

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/hugetlb.c: fix UAF of vma in hugetlb fault pathway

Syzbot reports a UAF in hugetlb_fault().  This happens because
vmf_anon_prepare() could drop the per-VMA lock and allow the current VMA
to be freed before hugetlb_vma_unlock_read() is called.

We can fix this by using a modified version of vmf_anon_prepare() that
doesn't release the VMA lock on failure, and then release it ourselves
after hugetlb_vma_unlock_read().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47676 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
