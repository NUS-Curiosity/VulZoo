Subject: CVE-2024-40919: bnxt_en: Adjust logging of firmware messages in case of released token in __hwrm_send()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bnxt_en: Adjust logging of firmware messages in case of released token in __hwrm_send()

In case of token is released due to token->state == BNXT_HWRM_DEFERRED,
released token (set to NULL) is used in log messages. This issue is
expected to be prevented by HWRM_ERR_CODE_PF_UNAVAILABLE error code. But
this error code is returned by recent firmware. So some firmware may not
return it. This may lead to NULL pointer dereference.
Adjust this issue by adding token pointer check.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40919 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
