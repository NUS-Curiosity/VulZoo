Subject: CVE-2024-56683: drm/vc4: hdmi: Avoid hang with debug registers when suspended

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vc4: hdmi: Avoid hang with debug registers when suspended

Trying to read /sys/kernel/debug/dri/1/hdmi1_regs
when the hdmi is disconnected results in a fatal system hang.

This is due to the pm suspend code disabling the dvp clock.
That is just a gate of the 108MHz clock in DVP_HT_RPI_MISC_CONFIG,
which results in accesses hanging AXI bus.

Protect against this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56683 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
