Subject: CVE-2024-27010: net/sched: Fix mirred deadlock on device recursion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: Fix mirred deadlock on device recursion

When the mirred action is used on a classful egress qdisc and a packet is
mirrored or redirected to self we hit a qdisc lock deadlock.
See trace below.

Example setup (eth0->eth0) to recreate
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: htb default 30
tc filter add dev eth0 handle 1: protocol ip prio 2 matchall \
     action mirred egress redirect dev eth0

Another example(eth0->eth1->eth0) to recreate
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: htb default 30
tc filter add dev eth0 handle 1: protocol ip prio 2 matchall \
     action mirred egress redirect dev eth1

tc qdisc add dev eth1 root handle 1: htb default 30
tc filter add dev eth1 handle 1: protocol ip prio 2 matchall \
     action mirred egress redirect dev eth0

We fix this by adding an owner field (CPU id) to struct Qdisc set after
root qdisc is entered. When the softirq enters it a second time, if the
qdisc owner is the same CPU, the packet is dropped to break the loop.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27010 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	include/net/sch_generic.h
	net/core/dev.c
	net/sched/sch_generic.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/e6b90468da4dae2281a6e381107f411efb48b0ef
