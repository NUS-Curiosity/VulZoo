Subject: CVE-2024-38584: net: ti: icssg_prueth: Fix NULL pointer dereference in prueth_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ti: icssg_prueth: Fix NULL pointer dereference in prueth_probe()

In the prueth_probe() function, if one of the calls to emac_phy_connect()
fails due to of_phy_connect() returning NULL, then the subsequent call to
phy_attached_info() will dereference a NULL pointer.

Check the return code of emac_phy_connect and fail cleanly if there is an
error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38584 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
