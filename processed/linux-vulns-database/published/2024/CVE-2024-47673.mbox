Subject: CVE-2024-47673: wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: pause TCM when the firmware is stopped

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: pause TCM when the firmware is stopped

Not doing so will make us send a host command to the transport while the
firmware is not alive, which will trigger a WARNING.

bad state = 0

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
