Subject: CVE-2024-50145: octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

octeon_ep: Add SKB allocation failures handling in __octep_oq_process_rx()

build_skb() returns NULL in case of a memory allocation failure so handle
it inside __octep_oq_process_rx() to avoid NULL pointer dereference.

__octep_oq_process_rx() is called during NAPI polling by the driver. If
skb allocation fails, keep on pulling packets out of the Rx DMA queue: we
shouldn't break the polling immediately and thus falsely indicate to the
octep_napi_poll() that the Rx pressure is going down. As there is no
associated skb in this case, don't process the packets and don't push them
up the network stack - they are skipped.

Helper function is implemented to unmmap/flush all the fragment buffers
used by the dropped packet. 'alloc_failures' counter is incremented to
mark the skb allocation error in driver statistics.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50145 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
