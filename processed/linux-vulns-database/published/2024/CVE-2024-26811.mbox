Subject: CVE-2024-26811: ksmbd: validate payload size in ipc response

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ksmbd: validate payload size in ipc response

If installing malicious ksmbd-tools, ksmbd.mountd can return invalid ipc
response to ksmbd kernel server. ksmbd should validate payload size of
ipc response from ksmbd.mountd to avoid memory overrun or
slab-out-of-bounds. This patch validate 3 ipc response that has payload.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
