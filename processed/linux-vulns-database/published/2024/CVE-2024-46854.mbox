Subject: CVE-2024-46854: net: dpaa: Pad packets to ETH_ZLEN

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: dpaa: Pad packets to ETH_ZLEN

When sending packets under 60 bytes, up to three bytes of the buffer
following the data may be leaked. Avoid this by extending all packets to
ETH_ZLEN, ensuring nothing is leaked in the padding. This bug can be
reproduced by running

	$ ping -s 11 destination

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46854 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
