Subject: CVE-2024-46705: drm/xe: reset mmio mappings with devm

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: reset mmio mappings with devm

Set our various mmio mappings to NULL. This should make it easier to
catch something rogue trying to mess with mmio after device removal. For
example, we might unmap everything and then start hitting some mmio
address which has already been unmamped by us and then remapped by
something else, causing all kinds of carnage.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46705 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
