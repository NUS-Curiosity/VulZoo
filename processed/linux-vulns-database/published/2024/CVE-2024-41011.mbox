Subject: CVE-2024-41011: drm/amdkfd: don't allow mapping the MMIO HDP page with large pages

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: don't allow mapping the MMIO HDP page with large pages

We don't get the right offset in that case.  The GPU has
an unused 4K area of the register BAR space into which you can
remap registers.  We remap the HDP flush registers into this
space to allow userspace (CPU or GPU) to flush the HDP when it
updates VRAM.  However, on systems with >4K pages, we end up
exposing PAGE_SIZE of MMIO space.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41011 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
