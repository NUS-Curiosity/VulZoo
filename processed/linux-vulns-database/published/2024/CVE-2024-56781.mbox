Subject: CVE-2024-56781: powerpc/prom_init: Fixup missing powermac #size-cells

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/prom_init: Fixup missing powermac #size-cells

On some powermacs `escc` nodes are missing `#size-cells` properties,
which is deprecated and now triggers a warning at boot since commit
045b14ca5c36 ("of: WARN on deprecated #address-cells/#size-cells
handling").

For example:

  Missing '#size-cells' in /pci@f2000000/mac-io@c/escc@13000
  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at drivers/of/base.c:133 of_bus_n_size_cells+0x98/0x108
  Hardware name: PowerMac3,1 7400 0xc0209 PowerMac
  ...
  Call Trace:
    of_bus_n_size_cells+0x98/0x108 (unreliable)
    of_bus_default_count_cells+0x40/0x60
    __of_get_address+0xc8/0x21c
    __of_address_to_resource+0x5c/0x228
    pmz_init_port+0x5c/0x2ec

    pmz_console_init+0x10/0x48
    console_init+0xcc/0x138
    start_kernel+0x5c4/0x694

As powermacs boot via prom_init it's possible to add the missing
properties to the device tree during boot, avoiding the warning. Note
that `escc-legacy` nodes are also missing `#size-cells` properties, but
they are skipped by the macio driver, so leave them alone.

Depends-on: 045b14ca5c36 ("of: WARN on deprecated #address-cells/#size-cells handling")

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56781 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
