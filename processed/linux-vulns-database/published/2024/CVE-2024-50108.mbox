Subject: CVE-2024-50108: drm/amd/display: Disable PSR-SU on Parade 08-01 TCON too

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Disable PSR-SU on Parade 08-01 TCON too

Stuart Hayhurst has found that both at bootup and fullscreen VA-API video
is leading to black screens for around 1 second and kernel WARNING [1] traces
when calling dmub_psr_enable() with Parade 08-01 TCON.

These symptoms all go away with PSR-SU disabled for this TCON, so disable
it for now while DMUB traces [2] from the failure can be analyzed and the failure
state properly root caused.

(cherry picked from commit afb634a6823d8d9db23c5fb04f79c5549349628b)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50108 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
