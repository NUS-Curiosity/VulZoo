Subject: CVE-2024-53179: smb: client: fix use-after-free of signing key

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix use-after-free of signing key

Customers have reported use-after-free in @ses->auth_key.response with
SMB2.1 + sign mounts which occurs due to following race:

task A                         task B
cifs_mount()
 dfs_mount_share()
  get_session()
   cifs_mount_get_session()    cifs_send_recv()
    cifs_get_smb_ses()          compound_send_recv()
     cifs_setup_session()        smb2_setup_request()
      kfree_sensitive()           smb2_calc_signature()
                                   crypto_shash_setkey() *UAF*

Fix this by ensuring that we have a valid @ses->auth_key.response by
checking whether @ses->ses_status is SES_GOOD or SES_EXITING with
@ses->ses_lock held.  After commit 24a9799aa8ef ("smb: client: fix UAF
in smb2_reconnect_server()"), we made sure to call ->logoff() only
when @ses was known to be good (e.g. valid ->auth_key.response), so
it's safe to access signing key when @ses->ses_status == SES_EXITING.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53179 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
