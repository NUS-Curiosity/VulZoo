Subject: CVE-2024-50166: fsl/fman: Fix refcount handling of fman-related devices

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fsl/fman: Fix refcount handling of fman-related devices

In mac_probe() there are multiple calls to of_find_device_by_node(),
fman_bind() and fman_port_bind() which takes references to of_dev->dev.
Not all references taken by these calls are released later on error path
in mac_probe() and in mac_remove() which lead to reference leaks.

Add references release.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50166 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
