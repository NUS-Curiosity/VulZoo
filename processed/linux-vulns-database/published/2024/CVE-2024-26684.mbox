Subject: CVE-2024-26684: net: stmmac: xgmac: fix handling of DPP safety error for DMA channels

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: stmmac: xgmac: fix handling of DPP safety error for DMA channels

Commit 56e58d6c8a56 ("net: stmmac: Implement Safety Features in
XGMAC core") checks and reports safety errors, but leaves the
Data Path Parity Errors for each channel in DMA unhandled at all, lead to
a storm of interrupt.
Fix it by checking and clearing the DMA_DPP_Interrupt_Status register.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26684 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
