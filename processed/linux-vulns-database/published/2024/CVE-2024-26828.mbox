Subject: CVE-2024-26828: cifs: fix underflow in parse_server_interfaces()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: fix underflow in parse_server_interfaces()

In this loop, we step through the buffer and after each item we check
if the size_left is greater than the minimum size we need.  However,
the problem is that "bytes_left" is type ssize_t while sizeof() is type
size_t.  That means that because of type promotion, the comparison is
done as an unsigned and if we have negative bytes left the loop
continues instead of ending.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26828 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
