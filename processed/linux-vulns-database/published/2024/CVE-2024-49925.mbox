Subject: CVE-2024-49925: fbdev: efifb: Register sysfs groups through driver core

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fbdev: efifb: Register sysfs groups through driver core

The driver core can register and cleanup sysfs groups already.
Make use of that functionality to simplify the error handling and
cleanup.

Also avoid a UAF race during unregistering where the sysctl attributes
were usable after the info struct was freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49925 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
