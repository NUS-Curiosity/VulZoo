Subject: CVE-2024-50120: smb: client: Handle kstrdup failures for passwords

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: Handle kstrdup failures for passwords

In smb3_reconfigure(), after duplicating ctx->password and
ctx->password2 with kstrdup(), we need to check for allocation
failures.

If ses->password allocation fails, return -ENOMEM.
If ses->password2 allocation fails, free ses->password, set it
to NULL, and return -ENOMEM.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50120 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
