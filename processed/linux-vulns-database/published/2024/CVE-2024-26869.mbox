Subject: CVE-2024-26869: f2fs: fix to truncate meta inode pages forcely

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: fix to truncate meta inode pages forcely

Below race case can cause data corruption:

Thread A				GC thread
					- gc_data_segment
					 - ra_data_block
					  - locked meta_inode page
- f2fs_inplace_write_data
 - invalidate_mapping_pages
 : fail to invalidate meta_inode page
   due to lock failure or dirty|writeback
   status
 - f2fs_submit_page_bio
 : write last dirty data to old blkaddr
					 - move_data_block
					  - load old data from meta_inode page
					  - f2fs_submit_page_write
					  : write old data to new blkaddr

Because invalidate_mapping_pages() will skip invalidating page which
has unclear status including locked, dirty, writeback and so on, so
we need to use truncate_inode_pages_range() instead of
invalidate_mapping_pages() to make sure meta_inode page will be dropped.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26869 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
