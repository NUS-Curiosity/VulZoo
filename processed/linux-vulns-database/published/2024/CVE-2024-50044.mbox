Subject: CVE-2024-50044: Bluetooth: RFCOMM: FIX possible deadlock in rfcomm_sk_state_change

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: RFCOMM: FIX possible deadlock in rfcomm_sk_state_change

rfcomm_sk_state_change attempts to use sock_lock so it must never be
called with it locked but rfcomm_sock_ioctl always attempt to lock it
causing the following trace:

======================================================
WARNING: possible circular locking dependency detected
6.8.0-syzkaller-08951-gfe46a7dd189e #0 Not tainted
------------------------------------------------------
syz-executor386/5093 is trying to acquire lock:

but task is already holding lock:

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50044 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
