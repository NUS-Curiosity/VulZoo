Subject: CVE-2024-57988: Bluetooth: btbcm: Fix NULL deref in btbcm_get_board_name()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: btbcm: Fix NULL deref in btbcm_get_board_name()

devm_kstrdup() can return a NULL pointer on failure,but this
returned value in btbcm_get_board_name() is not checked.
Add NULL check in btbcm_get_board_name(), to handle kernel NULL
pointer dereference error.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57988 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
