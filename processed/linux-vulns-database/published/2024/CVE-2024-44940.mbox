Subject: CVE-2024-44940: fou: remove warn in gue_gro_receive on unsupported protocol

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fou: remove warn in gue_gro_receive on unsupported protocol

Drop the WARN_ON_ONCE inn gue_gro_receive if the encapsulated type is
not known or does not have a GRO handler.

Such a packet is easily constructed. Syzbot generates them and sets
off this warning.

Remove the warning as it is expected and not actionable.

The warning was previously reduced from WARN_ON to WARN_ON_ONCE in
commit 270136613bf7 ("fou: Do WARN_ON_ONCE in gue_gro_receive for bad
proto callbacks").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44940 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
