Subject: CVE-2024-35788: drm/amd/display: Fix bounds check for dcn35 DcfClocks

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Fix bounds check for dcn35 DcfClocks

[Why]
NumFclkLevelsEnabled is used for DcfClocks bounds check
instead of designated NumDcfClkLevelsEnabled.
That can cause array index out-of-bounds access.

[How]
Use designated variable for dcn35 DcfClocks bounds check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35788 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
