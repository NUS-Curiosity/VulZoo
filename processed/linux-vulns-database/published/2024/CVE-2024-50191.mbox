Subject: CVE-2024-50191: ext4: don't set SB_RDONLY after filesystem errors

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: don't set SB_RDONLY after filesystem errors

When the filesystem is mounted with errors=remount-ro, we were setting
SB_RDONLY flag to stop all filesystem modifications. We knew this misses
proper locking (sb->s_umount) and does not go through proper filesystem
remount procedure but it has been the way this worked since early ext2
days and it was good enough for catastrophic situation damage
mitigation. Recently, syzbot has found a way (see link) to trigger
warnings in filesystem freezing because the code got confused by
SB_RDONLY changing under its hands. Since these days we set
EXT4_FLAGS_SHUTDOWN on the superblock which is enough to stop all
filesystem modifications, modifying SB_RDONLY shouldn't be needed. So
stop doing that.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50191 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
