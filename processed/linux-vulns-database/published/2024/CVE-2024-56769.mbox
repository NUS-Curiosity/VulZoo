Subject: CVE-2024-56769: media: dvb-frontends: dib3000mb: fix uninit-value in dib3000_write_reg

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: dvb-frontends: dib3000mb: fix uninit-value in dib3000_write_reg

Syzbot reports [1] an uninitialized value issue found by KMSAN in
dib3000_read_reg().

Local u8 rb[2] is used in i2c_transfer() as a read buffer; in case
that call fails, the buffer may end up with some undefined values.

Since no elaborate error handling is expected in dib3000_write_reg(),
simply zero out rb buffer to mitigate the problem.

[1] Syzkaller report
dvb-usb: bulk message failed: -22 (6/0)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
