Subject: CVE-2024-26585: tls: fix race between tx work scheduling and socket close

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tls: fix race between tx work scheduling and socket close

Similarly to previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg)
may exit as soon as the async crypto handler calls complete().
Reorder scheduling the work before calling complete().
This seems more logical in the first place, as it's
the inverse order of what the submitting thread will do.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26585 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
