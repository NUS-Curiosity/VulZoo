Subject: CVE-2024-53090: afs: Fix lock recursion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

afs: Fix lock recursion

afs_wake_up_async_call() can incur lock recursion.  The problem is that it
is called from AF_RXRPC whilst holding the ->notify_lock, but it tries to
take a ref on the afs_call struct in order to pass it to a work queue - but
if the afs_call is already queued, we then have an extraneous ref that must
be put... calling afs_put_call() may call back down into AF_RXRPC through
rxrpc_kernel_shutdown_call(), however, which might try taking the
->notify_lock again.

This case isn't very common, however, so defer it to a workqueue.  The oops
looks something like:

  BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0, krxrpcio/7001/1646
   lock: 0xffff888141399b30, .magic: dead4ead, .owner: krxrpcio/7001/1646, .owner_cpu: 0

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/afs/internal.h
	fs/afs/rxrpc.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d7cbf81df996b1eae2dee8deb6df08e2eba78661
