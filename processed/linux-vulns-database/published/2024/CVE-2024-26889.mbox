Subject: CVE-2024-26889: Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix possible buffer overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_core: Fix possible buffer overflow

struct hci_dev_info has a fixed size name[8] field so in the event that
hdev->name is bigger than that strcpy would attempt to write past its
size, so this fixes this problem by switching to use strscpy.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26889 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
