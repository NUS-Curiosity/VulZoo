Subject: CVE-2024-38554: ax25: Fix reference count leak issue of net_device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ax25: Fix reference count leak issue of net_device

There is a reference count leak issue of the object "net_device" in
ax25_dev_device_down(). When the ax25 device is shutting down, the
ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count of net_device one
or zero times depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will
cause memory leak.

In order to solve the above issue, decrease the reference count of
net_device after dev->ax25_ptr is set to null.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38554 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
