Subject: CVE-2024-26750: af_unix: Drop oob_skb ref before purging queue in GC.

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

af_unix: Drop oob_skb ref before purging queue in GC.

syzbot reported another task hung in __unix_gc().  [0]

The current while loop assumes that all of the left candidates
have oob_skb and calling kfree_skb(oob_skb) releases the remaining
candidates.

However, I missed a case that oob_skb has self-referencing fd and
another fd and the latter sk is placed before the former in the
candidate list.  Then, the while loop never proceeds, resulting
the task hung.

__unix_gc() has the same loop just before purging the collected skb,
so we can call kfree_skb(oob_skb) there and let __skb_queue_purge()
release all inflight sockets.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
