Subject: CVE-2024-35850: Bluetooth: qca: fix NULL-deref on non-serdev setup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: qca: fix NULL-deref on non-serdev setup

Qualcomm ROME controllers can be registered from the Bluetooth line
discipline and in this case the HCI UART serdev pointer is NULL.

Add the missing sanity check to prevent a NULL-pointer dereference when
setup() is called for a non-serdev controller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35850 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
