Subject: CVE-2024-53107: fs/proc/task_mmu: prevent integer overflow in pagemap_scan_get_args()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/proc/task_mmu: prevent integer overflow in pagemap_scan_get_args()

The "arg->vec_len" variable is a u64 that comes from the user at the start
of the function.  The "arg->vec_len * sizeof(struct page_region))"
multiplication can lead to integer wrapping.  Use size_mul() to avoid
that.

Also the size_add/mul() functions work on unsigned long so for 32bit
systems we need to ensure that "arg->vec_len" fits in an unsigned long.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53107 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	fs/proc/task_mmu.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
