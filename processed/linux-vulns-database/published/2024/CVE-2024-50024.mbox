Subject: CVE-2024-50024: net: Fix an unsafe loop on the list

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: Fix an unsafe loop on the list

The kernel may crash when deleting a genetlink family if there are still
listeners for that family:

Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]
  ...
  NIP [c000000000c080bc] netlink_update_socket_mc+0x3c/0xc0
  LR [c000000000c0f764] __netlink_clear_multicast_users+0x74/0xc0
  Call Trace:
__netlink_clear_multicast_users+0x74/0xc0
genl_unregister_family+0xd4/0x2d0

Change the unsafe loop on the list to a safe one, because inside the
loop there is an element removal from this list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50024 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
