Subject: CVE-2024-46826: ELF: fix kernel.randomize_va_space double read

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ELF: fix kernel.randomize_va_space double read

ELF loader uses "randomize_va_space" twice. It is sysctl and can change
at any moment, so 2 loads could see 2 different values in theory with
unpredictable consequences.

Issue exactly one load for consistent value across one exec.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46826 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
