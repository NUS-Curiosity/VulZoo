Subject: CVE-2024-41074: cachefiles: Set object to close if ondemand_id < 0 in copen

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachefiles: Set object to close if ondemand_id < 0 in copen

If copen is maliciously called in the user mode, it may delete the request
corresponding to the random id. And the request may have not been read yet.

Note that when the object is set to reopen, the open request will be done
with the still reopen state in above case. As a result, the request
corresponding to this object is always skipped in select_req function, so
the read request is never completed and blocks other process.

Fix this issue by simply set object to close if its id < 0 in copen.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41074 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
