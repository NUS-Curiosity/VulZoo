Subject: CVE-2024-26914: drm/amd/display: fix incorrect mpc_combine array size

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: fix incorrect mpc_combine array size

[why]
MAX_SURFACES is per stream, while MAX_PLANES is per asic. The
mpc_combine is an array that records all the planes per asic. Therefore
MAX_PLANES should be used as the array size. Using MAX_SURFACES causes
array overflow when there are more than 3 planes.

[how]
Use the MAX_PLANES for the mpc_combine array size.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26914 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.7.6 with commit 0bd8ef618a42d7e6ea3f701065264e15678025e3

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0bd8ef618a42d7e6ea3f701065264e15678025e3
