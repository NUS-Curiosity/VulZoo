Subject: CVE-2024-39499: vmci: prevent speculation leaks by sanitizing event in event_deliver()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vmci: prevent speculation leaks by sanitizing event in event_deliver()

Coverity spotted that event_msg is controlled by user-space,
event_msg->event_data.event is passed to event_deliver() and used
as an index without sanitization.

This change ensures that the event index is sanitized to mitigate any
possibility of speculative information leaks.

This bug was discovered and resolved using Coverity Static Analysis
Security Testing (SAST) by Synopsys, Inc.

Only compile tested, no access to HW.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39499 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
