Subject: CVE-2024-46845: tracing/timerlat: Only clear timer if a kthread exists

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/timerlat: Only clear timer if a kthread exists

The timerlat tracer can use user space threads to check for osnoise and
timer latency. If the program using this is killed via a SIGTERM, the
threads are shutdown one at a time and another tracing instance can start
up resetting the threads before they are fully closed. That causes the
hrtimer assigned to the kthread to be shutdown and freed twice when the
dying thread finally closes the file descriptors, causing a use-after-free
bug.

Only cancel the hrtimer if the associated thread is still around. Also add
the interface_lock around the resetting of the tlat_var->kthread.

Note, this is just a quick fix that can be backported to stable. A real
fix is to have a better synchronization between the shutdown of old
threads and the starting of new ones.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46845 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8c72f0b2c45f21cb8b00fc37f79f632d7e46c2ed
