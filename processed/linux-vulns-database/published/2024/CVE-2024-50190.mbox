Subject: CVE-2024-50190: ice: fix memleak in ice_init_tx_topology()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ice: fix memleak in ice_init_tx_topology()

Fix leak of the FW blob (DDP pkg).

Make ice_cfg_tx_topo() const-correct, so ice_init_tx_topology() can avoid
copying whole FW blob. Copy just the topology section, and only when
needed. Reuse the buffer allocated for the read of the current topology.

This was found by kmemleak, with the following trace for each PF:
    [<ffffffff8761044d>] kmemdup_noprof+0x1d/0x50
    [<ffffffffc0a0a480>] ice_init_ddp_config+0x100/0x220 [ice]
    [<ffffffffc0a0da7f>] ice_init_dev+0x6f/0x200 [ice]
    [<ffffffffc0a0dc49>] ice_init+0x29/0x560 [ice]
    [<ffffffffc0a10c1d>] ice_probe+0x21d/0x310 [ice]

Constify ice_cfg_tx_topo() @buf parameter.
This cascades further down to few more functions.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50190 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
