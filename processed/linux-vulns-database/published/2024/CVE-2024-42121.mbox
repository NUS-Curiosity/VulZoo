Subject: CVE-2024-42121: drm/amd/display: Check index msg_id before read or write

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Check index msg_id before read or write

[WHAT]
msg_id is used as an array index and it cannot be a negative value, and
therefore cannot be equal to MOD_HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_INVALID (-1).

[HOW]
Check whether msg_id is valid before reading and setting.

This fixes 4 OVERRUN issues reported by Coverity.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42121 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
