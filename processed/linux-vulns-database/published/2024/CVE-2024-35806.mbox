Subject: CVE-2024-35806: soc: fsl: qbman: Always disable interrupts when taking cgr_lock

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

soc: fsl: qbman: Always disable interrupts when taking cgr_lock

smp_call_function_single disables IRQs when executing the callback. To
prevent deadlocks, we must disable IRQs when taking cgr_lock elsewhere.
This is already done by qman_update_cgr and qman_delete_cgr; fix the
other lockers.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35806 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
