Subject: CVE-2024-40929: wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: check n_ssids before accessing the ssids

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: check n_ssids before accessing the ssids

In some versions of cfg80211, the ssids poinet might be a valid one even
though n_ssids is 0. Accessing the pointer in this case will cuase an
out-of-bound access. Fix this by checking n_ssids first.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40929 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
