Subject: CVE-2024-50080: ublk: don't allow user copy for unprivileged device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ublk: don't allow user copy for unprivileged device

UBLK_F_USER_COPY requires userspace to call write() on ublk char
device for filling request buffer, and unprivileged device can't
be trusted.

So don't allow user copy for unprivileged device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50080 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
