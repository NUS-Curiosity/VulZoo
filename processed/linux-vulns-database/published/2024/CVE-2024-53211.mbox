Subject: CVE-2024-53211: net/l2tp: fix warning in l2tp_exit_net found by syzbot

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/l2tp: fix warning in l2tp_exit_net found by syzbot

In l2tp's net exit handler, we check that an IDR is empty before
destroying it:

	WARN_ON_ONCE(!idr_is_empty(&pn->l2tp_tunnel_idr));
	idr_destroy(&pn->l2tp_tunnel_idr);

By forcing memory allocation failures in idr_alloc_32, syzbot is able
to provoke a condition where idr_is_empty returns false despite there
being no items in the IDR. This turns out to be because the radix tree
of the IDR contains only internal radix-tree nodes and it is this that
causes idr_is_empty to return false. The internal nodes are cleaned by
idr_destroy.

Use idr_for_each to check that the IDR is empty instead of
idr_is_empty to avoid the problem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53211 to this issue.

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	net/l2tp/l2tp_core.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a487cc8986d6dd75b60b59004f3bd2ea9b4dd541
