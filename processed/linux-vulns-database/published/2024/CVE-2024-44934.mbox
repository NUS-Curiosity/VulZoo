Subject: CVE-2024-44934: net: bridge: mcast: wait for previous gc cycles when removing port

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: bridge: mcast: wait for previous gc cycles when removing port

syzbot hit a use-after-free[1] which is caused because the bridge doesn't
make sure that all previous garbage has been collected when removing a
port. What happens is:
      CPU 1                   CPU 2
 start gc cycle           remove port
                         acquire gc lock first
 wait for lock
                         call br_multicasg_gc() directly
 acquire lock now but    free port
 the port can be freed
 while grp timers still
 running

Make sure all previous gc cycles have finished by using flush_work before
freeing the port.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
