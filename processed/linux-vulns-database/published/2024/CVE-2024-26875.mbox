[Analyze]
Task A set disconnect_flag = !0, which resulted in Task B's condition being met
and releasing mp, leading to this issue.

[Fix]
Place the disconnect_flag assignment operation after all code in pvr2_context_disconnect()
to avoid this issue.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26875 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
