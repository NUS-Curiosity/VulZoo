Subject: CVE-2024-47735: RDMA/hns: Fix spin_unlock_irqrestore() called with IRQs enabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/hns: Fix spin_unlock_irqrestore() called with IRQs enabled

Fix missuse of spin_lock_irq()/spin_unlock_irq() when
spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_lock_irqrestore() was hold.

This was discovered through the lock debugging, and the corresponding
log is as follows:

raw_local_irq_restore() called with IRQs enabled
WARNING: CPU: 96 PID: 2074 at kernel/locking/irqflag-debug.c:10 warn_bogus_irq_restore+0x30/0x40

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
