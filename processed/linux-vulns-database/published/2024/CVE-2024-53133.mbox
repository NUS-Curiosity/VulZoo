Subject: CVE-2024-53133: drm/amd/display: Handle dml allocation failure to avoid crash

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Handle dml allocation failure to avoid crash

[Why]
In the case where a dml allocation fails for any reason, the
current state's dml contexts would no longer be valid. Then
subsequent calls dc_state_copy_internal would shallow copy
invalid memory and if the new state was released, a double
free would occur.

[How]
Reset dml pointers in new_state to NULL and avoid invalid
pointer

(cherry picked from commit bcafdc61529a48f6f06355d78eb41b3aeda5296c)

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
