Subject: CVE-2024-57880: ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: Add space for a terminator into DAIs array

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: Add space for a terminator into DAIs array

The code uses the initialised member of the asoc_sdw_dailink struct to
determine if a member of the array is in use. However in the case the
array is completely full this will lead to an access 1 past the end of
the array, expand the array by one entry to include a space for a
terminator.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57880 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
