Subject: CVE-2024-53236: xsk: Free skb when TX metadata options are invalid

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xsk: Free skb when TX metadata options are invalid

When a new skb is allocated for transmitting an xsk descriptor, i.e., for
every non-multibuf descriptor or the first frag of a multibuf descriptor,
but the descriptor is later found to have invalid options set for the TX
metadata, the new skb is never freed. This can leak skbs until the send
buffer is full which makes sending more packets impossible.

Fix this by freeing the skb in the error path if we are currently dealing
with the first frag, i.e., an skb allocated in this iteration of
xsk_build_skb.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53236 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
