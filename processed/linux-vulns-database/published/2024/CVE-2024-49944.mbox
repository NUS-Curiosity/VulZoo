Subject: CVE-2024-49944: sctp: set sk_state back to CLOSED if autobind fails in sctp_listen_start

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sctp: set sk_state back to CLOSED if autobind fails in sctp_listen_start

In sctp_listen_start() invoked by sctp_inet_listen(), it should set the
sk_state back to CLOSED if sctp_autobind() fails due to whatever reason.

Otherwise, next time when calling sctp_inet_listen(), if sctp_sk(sk)->reuse
is already set via setsockopt(SCTP_REUSE_PORT), sctp_sk(sk)->bind_hash will
be dereferenced as sk_state is LISTENING, which causes a crash as bind_hash
is NULL.

  KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000000007]
  RIP: 0010:sctp_inet_listen+0x7f0/0xa20 net/sctp/socket.c:8617
  Call Trace:

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49944 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
