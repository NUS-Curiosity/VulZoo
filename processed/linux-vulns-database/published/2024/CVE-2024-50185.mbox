Subject: CVE-2024-50185: mptcp: handle consistently DSS corruption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: handle consistently DSS corruption

Bugged peer implementation can send corrupted DSS options, consistently
hitting a few warning in the data path. Use DEBUG_NET assertions, to
avoid the splat on some builds and handle consistently the error, dumping
related MIBs and performing fallback and/or reset according to the
subflow type.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50185 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
