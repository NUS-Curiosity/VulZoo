Subject: CVE-2024-42083: ionic: fix kernel panic due to multi-buffer handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ionic: fix kernel panic due to multi-buffer handling

Currently, the ionic_run_xdp() doesn't handle multi-buffer packets
properly for XDP_TX and XDP_REDIRECT.
When a jumbo frame is received, the ionic_run_xdp() first makes xdp
frame with all necessary pages in the rx descriptor.
And if the action is either XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT, it should unmap
dma-mapping and reset page pointer to NULL for all pages, not only the
first page.
But it doesn't for SG pages. So, SG pages unexpectedly will be reused.
It eventually causes kernel panic.

Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0x504f4e4dbebc64ff: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8ae401525ae84228a8986bb369224a6224e4d22f
