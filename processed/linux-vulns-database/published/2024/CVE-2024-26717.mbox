Subject: CVE-2024-26717: HID: i2c-hid-of: fix NULL-deref on failed power up

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

HID: i2c-hid-of: fix NULL-deref on failed power up

A while back the I2C HID implementation was split in an ACPI and OF
part, but the new OF driver never initialises the client pointer which
is dereferenced on power-up failures.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26717 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
