Subject: CVE-2024-41085: cxl/mem: Fix no cxl_nvd during pmem region auto-assembling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cxl/mem: Fix no cxl_nvd during pmem region auto-assembling

When CXL subsystem is auto-assembling a pmem region during cxl
endpoint port probing, always hit below calltrace.

 BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000078

The cxl_nvd of the memdev needs to be available during the pmem region
probe. Currently the cxl_nvd is registered after the endpoint port probe.
The endpoint probe, in the case of autoassembly of regions, can cause a
pmem region probe requiring the not yet available cxl_nvd. Adjust the
sequence so this dependency is met.

This requires adding a port parameter to cxl_find_nvdimm_bridge() that
can be used to query the ancestor root port. The endpoint port is not
yet available, but will share a common ancestor with its parent, so
start the query from there instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41085 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
