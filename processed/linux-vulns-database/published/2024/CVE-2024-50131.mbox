Subject: CVE-2024-50131: tracing: Consider the NULL character when validating the event length

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing: Consider the NULL character when validating the event length

strlen() returns a string length excluding the null byte. If the string
length equals to the maximum buffer length, the buffer will have no
space for the NULL terminating character.

This commit checks this condition and returns failure for it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50131 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
