Subject: CVE-2024-26910: netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation

The patch "netfilter: ipset: fix race condition between swap/destroy
and kernel side add/del/test", commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition.
But the synchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slows
it down: it can safely be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead.

Eric Dumazet pointed out that simply calling the destroy functions as
rcu callback does not work: sets with timeout use garbage collectors
which need cancelling at destroy which can wait. Therefore the destroy
functions are split into two: cancelling garbage collectors safely at
executing the command received by netlink and moving the remaining
part only into the rcu callback.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26910 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
