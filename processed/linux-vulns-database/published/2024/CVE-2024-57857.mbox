Subject: CVE-2024-57857: RDMA/siw: Remove direct link to net_device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/siw: Remove direct link to net_device

Do not manage a per device direct link to net_device. Rely
on associated ib_devices net_device management, not doubling
the effort locally. A badly managed local link to net_device
was causing a 'KASAN: slab-use-after-free' exception during
siw_query_port() call.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-57857 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
