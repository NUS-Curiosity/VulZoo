Subject: CVE-2024-35870: smb: client: fix UAF in smb2_reconnect_server()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix UAF in smb2_reconnect_server()

The UAF bug is due to smb2_reconnect_server() accessing a session that
is already being teared down by another thread that is executing
__cifs_put_smb_ses().  This can happen when (a) the client has
connection to the server but no session or (b) another thread ends up
setting @ses->ses_status again to something different than
SES_EXITING.

To fix this, we need to make sure to unconditionally set
@ses->ses_status to SES_EXITING and prevent any other threads from
setting a new status while we're still tearing it down.

The following can be reproduced by adding some delay to right after
the ipc is freed in __cifs_put_smb_ses() - which will give
smb2_reconnect_server() worker a chance to run and then accessing
@ses->ipc:

kinit ...
mount.cifs //srv/share /mnt/1 -o sec=krb5,nohandlecache,echo_interval=10
[disconnect srv]
ls /mnt/1 &>/dev/null
sleep 30
kdestroy
[reconnect srv]
sleep 10
umount /mnt/1
...

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
