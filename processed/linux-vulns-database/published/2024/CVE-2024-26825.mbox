Subject: CVE-2024-26825: nfc: nci: free rx_data_reassembly skb on NCI device cleanup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: nci: free rx_data_reassembly skb on NCI device cleanup

rx_data_reassembly skb is stored during NCI data exchange for processing
fragmented packets. It is dropped only when the last fragment is processed
or when an NTF packet with NCI_OP_RF_DEACTIVATE_NTF opcode is received.
However, the NCI device may be deallocated before that which leads to skb
leak.

As by design the rx_data_reassembly skb is bound to the NCI device and
nothing prevents the device to be freed before the skb is processed in
some way and cleaned, free it on the NCI device cleanup.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26825 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
