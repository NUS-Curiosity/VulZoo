Subject: CVE-2024-43888: mm: list_lru: fix UAF for memory cgroup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm: list_lru: fix UAF for memory cgroup

The mem_cgroup_from_slab_obj() is supposed to be called under rcu lock or
cgroup_mutex or others which could prevent returned memcg from being
freed.  Fix it by adding missing rcu read lock.

Found by code inspection.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
