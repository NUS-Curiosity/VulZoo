Subject: CVE-2024-46860: wifi: mt76: mt7921: fix NULL pointer access in mt7921_ipv6_addr_change

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mt76: mt7921: fix NULL pointer access in mt7921_ipv6_addr_change

When disabling wifi mt7921_ipv6_addr_change() is called as a notifier.
At this point mvif->phy is already NULL so we cannot use it here.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46860 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
