Subject: CVE-2024-45009: mptcp: pm: only decrement add_addr_accepted for MPJ req

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: pm: only decrement add_addr_accepted for MPJ req

Adding the following warning ...

  WARN_ON_ONCE(msk->pm.add_addr_accepted == 0)

... before decrementing the add_addr_accepted counter helped to find a
bug when running the "remove single subflow" subtest from the
mptcp_join.sh selftest.

Removing a 'subflow' endpoint will first trigger a RM_ADDR, then the
subflow closure. Before this patch, and upon the reception of the
RM_ADDR, the other peer will then try to decrement this
add_addr_accepted. That's not correct because the attached subflows have
not been created upon the reception of an ADD_ADDR.

A way to solve that is to decrement the counter only if the attached
subflow was an MP_JOIN to a remote id that was not 0, and initiated by
the host receiving the RM_ADDR.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-45009 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
