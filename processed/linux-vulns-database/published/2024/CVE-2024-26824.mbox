Subject: CVE-2024-26824: crypto: algif_hash - Remove bogus SGL free on zero-length error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

crypto: algif_hash - Remove bogus SGL free on zero-length error path

When a zero-length message is hashed by algif_hash, and an error
is triggered, it tries to free an SG list that was never allocated
in the first place.  Fix this by not freeing the SG list on the
zero-length error path.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26824 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
