Subject: CVE-2024-56654: Bluetooth: hci_event: Fix using rcu_read_(un)lock while iterating

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: hci_event: Fix using rcu_read_(un)lock while iterating

The usage of rcu_read_(un)lock while inside list_for_each_entry_rcu is
not safe since for the most part entries fetched this way shall be
treated as rcu_dereference:

	Note that the value returned by rcu_dereference() is valid
	only within the enclosing RCU read-side critical section [1]_.
	For example, the following is **not** legal::

		rcu_read_lock();
		p = rcu_dereference(head.next);
		rcu_read_unlock();
		x = p->address;	/* BUG!!! */
		rcu_read_lock();
		y = p->data;	/* BUG!!! */
		rcu_read_unlock();

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56654 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
