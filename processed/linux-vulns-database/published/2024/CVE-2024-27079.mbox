Subject: CVE-2024-27079: iommu/vt-d: Fix NULL domain on device release

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Fix NULL domain on device release

In the kdump kernel, the IOMMU operates in deferred_attach mode. In this
mode, info->domain may not yet be assigned by the time the release_device
function is called. It leads to the following crash in the crash kernel:

    BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 000000000000003c
    ...
    RIP: 0010:do_raw_spin_lock+0xa/0xa0
    ...

    ...
    i801_probe+0x423/0x740

Use the release_domain mechanism to fix it. The scalable mode context
entry which is not part of release domain should be cleared in
release_device().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27079 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/iommu/intel/iommu.c
	drivers/iommu/intel/pasid.c

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
