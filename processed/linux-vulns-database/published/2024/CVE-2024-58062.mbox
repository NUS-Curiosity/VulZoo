Subject: CVE-2024-58062: wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: avoid NULL pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: avoid NULL pointer dereference

When iterating over the links of a vif, we need to make sure that the
pointer is valid (in other words - that the link exists) before
dereferncing it.
Use for_each_vif_active_link that also does the check.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58062 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
