Subject: CVE-2024-41037: ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix null deref on system suspend entry

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix null deref on system suspend entry

When system enters suspend with an active stream, SOF core
calls hw_params_upon_resume(). On Intel platforms with HDA DMA used
to manage the link DMA, this leads to call chain of

   hda_dsp_set_hw_params_upon_resume()
 -> hda_dsp_dais_suspend()
 -> hda_dai_suspend()
 -> hda_ipc4_post_trigger()

A bug is hit in hda_dai_suspend() as hda_link_dma_cleanup() is run first,
which clears hext_stream->link_substream, and then hda_ipc4_post_trigger()
is called with a NULL snd_pcm_substream pointer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41037 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/8246bbf818ed7b8d5afc92b951e6d562b45c2450
