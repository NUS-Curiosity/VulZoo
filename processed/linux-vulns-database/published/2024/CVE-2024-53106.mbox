Subject: CVE-2024-53106: ima: fix buffer overrun in ima_eventdigest_init_common

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ima: fix buffer overrun in ima_eventdigest_init_common

Function ima_eventdigest_init() calls ima_eventdigest_init_common()
with HASH_ALGO__LAST which is then used to access the array
hash_digest_size[] leading to buffer overrun. Have a conditional
statement to handle this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53106 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
