Subject: CVE-2024-36932: thermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal/debugfs: Prevent use-after-free from occurring after cdev removal

Since thermal_debug_cdev_remove() does not run under cdev->lock, it can
run in parallel with thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() and it may free
the struct thermal_debugfs object used by the latter after it has been
checked against NULL.

If that happens, thermal_debug_cdev_state_update() will access memory
that has been freed already causing the kernel to crash.

Address this by using cdev->lock in thermal_debug_cdev_remove() around
the cdev->debugfs value check (in case the same cdev is removed at the
same time in two different threads) and its reset to NULL.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
