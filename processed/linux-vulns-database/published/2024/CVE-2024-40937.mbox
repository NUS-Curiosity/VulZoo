Subject: CVE-2024-40937: gve: Clear napi->skb before dev_kfree_skb_any()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gve: Clear napi->skb before dev_kfree_skb_any()

gve_rx_free_skb incorrectly leaves napi->skb referencing an skb after it
is freed with dev_kfree_skb_any(). This can result in a subsequent call
to napi_get_frags returning a dangling pointer.

Fix this by clearing napi->skb before the skb is freed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40937 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
