Subject: CVE-2024-35885: mlxbf_gige: stop interface during shutdown

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxbf_gige: stop interface during shutdown

The mlxbf_gige driver intermittantly encounters a NULL pointer
exception while the system is shutting down via "reboot" command.
The mlxbf_driver will experience an exception right after executing
its shutdown() method.  One example of this exception is:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000070
Mem abort info:
  ESR = 0x0000000096000004

During system shutdown, the mlxbf_gige driver's shutdown() is always executed.
However, the driver's stop() method will only execute if networking interface
configuration logic within the Linux distribution has been setup to do so.

If shutdown() executes but stop() does not execute, NAPI remains enabled
and this can lead to an exception if NAPI is scheduled while the hardware
interface has only been partially deinitialized.

The networking interface managed by the mlxbf_gige driver must be properly
stopped during system shutdown so that IFF_UP is cleared, the hardware
interface is put into a clean state, and NAPI is fully deinitialized.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35885 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
