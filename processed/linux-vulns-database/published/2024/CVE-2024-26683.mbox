Subject: CVE-2024-26683: wifi: cfg80211: detect stuck ECSA element in probe resp

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: cfg80211: detect stuck ECSA element in probe resp

We recently added some validation that we don't try to
connect to an AP that is currently in a channel switch
process, since that might want the channel to be quiet
or we might not be able to connect in time to hear the
switching in a beacon. This was in commit c09c4f31998b
("wifi: mac80211: don't connect to an AP while it's in
a CSA process").

However, we promptly got a report that this caused new
connection failures, and it turns out that the AP that
we now cannot connect to is permanently advertising an
extended channel switch announcement, even with quiet.
The AP in question was an Asus RT-AC53, with firmware
3.0.0.4.380_10760-g21a5898.

As a first step, attempt to detect that we're dealing
with such a situation, so mac80211 can use this later.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26683 to this issue.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	include/net/cfg80211.h
	net/wireless/scan.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/ce112c941c2b172afba3e913a90c380647d53975
