Subject: CVE-2024-40969: f2fs: don't set RO when shutting down f2fs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

f2fs: don't set RO when shutting down f2fs

Shutdown does not check the error of thaw_super due to readonly, which
causes a deadlock like below.

f2fs_ioc_shutdown(F2FS_GOING_DOWN_FULLSYNC)        issue_discard_thread
 - bdev_freeze
  - freeze_super
 - f2fs_stop_checkpoint()
  - f2fs_handle_critical_error                     - sb_start_write
    - set RO                                         - waiting
 - bdev_thaw
  - thaw_super_locked
    - return -EINVAL, if sb_rdonly()
 - f2fs_stop_discard_thread
  -> wait for kthread_stop(discard_thread);

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-40969 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
