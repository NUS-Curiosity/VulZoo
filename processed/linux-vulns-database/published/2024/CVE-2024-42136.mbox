Subject: CVE-2024-42136: cdrom: rearrange last_media_change check to avoid unintentional overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cdrom: rearrange last_media_change check to avoid unintentional overflow

When running syzkaller with the newly reintroduced signed integer wrap
sanitizer we encounter this splat:

[  366.015950] UBSAN: signed-integer-overflow in ../drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c:2361:33

Historically, the signed integer overflow sanitizer did not work in the
kernel due to its interaction with `-fwrapv` but this has since been
changed [1] in the newest version of Clang. It was re-enabled in the
kernel with Commit 557f8c582a9ba8ab ("ubsan: Reintroduce signed overflow
sanitizer").

Let's rearrange the check to not perform any arithmetic, thus not
tripping the sanitizer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42136 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
