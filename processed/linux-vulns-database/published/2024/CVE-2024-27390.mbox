Subject: CVE-2024-27390: ipv6: mcast: remove one synchronize_net() barrier in ipv6_mc_down()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: mcast: remove one synchronize_net() barrier in ipv6_mc_down()

As discussed in the past (commit 2d3916f31891 ("ipv6: fix skb drops
in igmp6_event_query() and igmp6_event_report()")) I think the
synchronize_net() call in ipv6_mc_down() is not needed.

Under load, synchronize_net() can last between 200 usec and 5 ms.

KASAN seems to agree as well.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27390 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
