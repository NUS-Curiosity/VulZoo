Subject: CVE-2024-42314: btrfs: fix extent map use-after-free when adding pages to compressed bio

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix extent map use-after-free when adding pages to compressed bio

At add_ra_bio_pages() we are accessing the extent map to calculate
'add_size' after we dropped our reference on the extent map, resulting
in a use-after-free. Fix this by computing 'add_size' before dropping our
extent map reference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42314 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
