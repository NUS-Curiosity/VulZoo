Subject: CVE-2024-50028: thermal: core: Reference count the zone in thermal_zone_get_by_id()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal: core: Reference count the zone in thermal_zone_get_by_id()

There are places in the thermal netlink code where nothing prevents
the thermal zone object from going away while being accessed after it
has been returned by thermal_zone_get_by_id().

To address this, make thermal_zone_get_by_id() get a reference on the
thermal zone device object to be returned with the help of get_device(),
under thermal_list_lock, and adjust all of its callers to this change
with the help of the cleanup.h infrastructure.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50028 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
