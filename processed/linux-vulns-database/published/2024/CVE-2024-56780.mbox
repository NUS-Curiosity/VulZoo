Subject: CVE-2024-56780: quota: flush quota_release_work upon quota writeback

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

quota: flush quota_release_work upon quota writeback

One of the paths quota writeback is called from is:

freeze_super()
  sync_filesystem()
    ext4_sync_fs()
      dquot_writeback_dquots()

Since we currently don't always flush the quota_release_work queue in
this path, we can end up with the following race:

 1. dquot are added to releasing_dquots list during regular operations.
 2. FS Freeze starts, however, this does not flush the quota_release_work queue.
 3. Freeze completes.
 4. Kernel eventually tries to flush the workqueue while FS is frozen which
    hits a WARN_ON since transaction gets started during frozen state:

  ext4_journal_check_start+0x28/0x110 [ext4] (unreliable)
  __ext4_journal_start_sb+0x64/0x1c0 [ext4]
  ext4_release_dquot+0x90/0x1d0 [ext4]
  quota_release_workfn+0x43c/0x4d0

Which is the following line:

  WARN_ON(sb->s_writers.frozen == SB_FREEZE_COMPLETE);

Which ultimately results in generic/390 failing due to dmesg
noise. This was detected on powerpc machine 15 cores.

To avoid this, make sure to flush the workqueue during
dquot_writeback_dquots() so we dont have any pending workitems after
freeze.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56780 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
