Subject: CVE-2024-26979: drm/vmwgfx: Fix possible null pointer derefence with invalid contexts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/vmwgfx: Fix possible null pointer derefence with invalid contexts

vmw_context_cotable can return either an error or a null pointer and its
usage sometimes went unchecked. Subsequent code would then try to access
either a null pointer or an error value.

The invalid dereferences were only possible with malformed userspace
apps which never properly initialized the rendering contexts.

Check the results of vmw_context_cotable to fix the invalid derefs.

Thanks:

who was the first person to discover it.
Niels De Graef who reported it and helped to track down the poc.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26979 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
