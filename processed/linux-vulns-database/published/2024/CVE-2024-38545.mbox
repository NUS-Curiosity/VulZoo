Subject: CVE-2024-38545: RDMA/hns: Fix UAF for cq async event

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/hns: Fix UAF for cq async event

The refcount of CQ is not protected by locks. When CQ asynchronous
events and CQ destruction are concurrent, CQ may have been released,
which will cause UAF.

Use the xa_lock() to protect the CQ refcount.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38545 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
