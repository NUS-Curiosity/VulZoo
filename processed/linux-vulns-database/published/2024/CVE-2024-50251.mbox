Subject: CVE-2024-50251: netfilter: nft_payload: sanitize offset and length before calling skb_checksum()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nft_payload: sanitize offset and length before calling skb_checksum()

If access to offset + length is larger than the skbuff length, then
skb_checksum() triggers BUG_ON().

skb_checksum() internally subtracts the length parameter while iterating
over skbuff, BUG_ON(len) at the end of it checks that the expected
length to be included in the checksum calculation is fully consumed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50251 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
