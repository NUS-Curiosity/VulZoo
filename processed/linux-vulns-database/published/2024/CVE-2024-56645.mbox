Subject: CVE-2024-56645: can: j1939: j1939_session_new(): fix skb reference counting

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: j1939: j1939_session_new(): fix skb reference counting

Since j1939_session_skb_queue() does an extra skb_get() for each new
skb, do the same for the initial one in j1939_session_new() to avoid
refcount underflow.

[mkl: clean up commit message]

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56645 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
