Subject: CVE-2024-38600: ALSA: Fix deadlocks with kctl removals at disconnection

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: Fix deadlocks with kctl removals at disconnection

In snd_card_disconnect(), we set card->shutdown flag at the beginning,
call callbacks and do sync for card->power_ref_sleep waiters at the
end.  The callback may delete a kctl element, and this can lead to a
deadlock when the device was in the suspended state.  Namely:

* A process waits for the power up at snd_power_ref_and_wait() in
  snd_ctl_info() or read/write() inside card->controls_rwsem.

* The system gets disconnected meanwhile, and the driver tries to
  delete a kctl via snd_ctl_remove*(); it tries to take
  card->controls_rwsem again, but this is already locked by the
  above.  Since the sleeper isn't woken up, this deadlocks.

An easy fix is to wake up sleepers before processing the driver
disconnect callbacks but right after setting the card->shutdown flag.
Then all sleepers will abort immediately, and the code flows again.

So, basically this patch moves the wait_event() call at the right
timing.  While we're at it, just to be sure, call wait_event_all()
instead of wait_event(), although we don't use exclusive events on
this queue for now.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38600 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
