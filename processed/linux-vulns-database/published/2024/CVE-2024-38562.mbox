Subject: CVE-2024-38562: wifi: nl80211: Avoid address calculations via out of bounds array indexing

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: nl80211: Avoid address calculations via out of bounds array indexing

Before request->channels[] can be used, request->n_channels must be set.
Additionally, address calculations for memory after the "channels" array
need to be calculated from the allocation base ("request") rather than
via the first "out of bounds" index of "channels", otherwise run-time
bounds checking will throw a warning.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38562 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
