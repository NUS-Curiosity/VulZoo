Subject: CVE-2024-39492: mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Fix pm_runtime_get_sync() warning in mbox shutdown

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mailbox: mtk-cmdq: Fix pm_runtime_get_sync() warning in mbox shutdown

The return value of pm_runtime_get_sync() in cmdq_mbox_shutdown()
will return 1 when pm runtime state is active, and we don't want to
get the warning message in this case.

So we change the return value < 0 for WARN_ON().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-39492 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2d42a37a4518478f075ccf848242b4a50e313a46
