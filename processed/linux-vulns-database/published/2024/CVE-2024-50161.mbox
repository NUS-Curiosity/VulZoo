Subject: CVE-2024-50161: bpf: Check the remaining info_cnt before repeating btf fields

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Check the remaining info_cnt before repeating btf fields

When trying to repeat the btf fields for array of nested struct, it
doesn't check the remaining info_cnt. The following splat will be
reported when the value of ret * nelems is greater than BTF_FIELDS_MAX:

  ------------[ cut here ]------------

Fix it by checking the remaining info_cnt in btf_repeat_fields() before
repeating the btf fields.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6f957d972feee9b385ea3ae6530310a84e55ba71
