Subject: CVE-2024-56621: scsi: ufs: core: Cancel RTC work during ufshcd_remove()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: ufs: core: Cancel RTC work during ufshcd_remove()

Currently, RTC work is only cancelled during __ufshcd_wl_suspend(). When
ufshcd is removed in ufshcd_remove(), RTC work is not cancelled. Due to
this, any further trigger of the RTC work after ufshcd_remove() would
result in a NULL pointer dereference as below:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000002a4
Workqueue: events ufshcd_rtc_work
Call trace:
 _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x34/0x8c
 pm_runtime_get_if_active+0x24/0xb4
 ufshcd_rtc_work+0x124/0x19c
 process_scheduled_works+0x18c/0x2d8
 worker_thread+0x144/0x280
 kthread+0x11c/0x128
 ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20

Since RTC work accesses the ufshcd internal structures, it should be cancelled
when ufshcd is removed. So do that in ufshcd_remove(), as per the order in
ufshcd_init().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56621 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
