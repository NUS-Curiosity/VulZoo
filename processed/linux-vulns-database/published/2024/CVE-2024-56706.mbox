Subject: CVE-2024-56706: s390/cpum_sf: Fix and protect memory allocation of SDBs with mutex

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/cpum_sf: Fix and protect memory allocation of SDBs with mutex

Reservation of the PMU hardware is done at first event creation
and is protected by a pair of mutex_lock() and mutex_unlock().
After reservation of the PMU hardware the memory
required for the PMUs the event is to be installed on is
allocated by allocate_buffers() and alloc_sampling_buffer().
This done outside of the mutex protection.
Without mutex protection two or more concurrent invocations of
perf_event_init() may run in parallel.
This can lead to allocation of Sample Data Blocks (SDBs)
multiple times for the same PMU.
Prevent this and protect memory allocation of SDBs by
mutex.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56706 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/4b3bdfa89635db6a53e02955548bd07bebcae233
