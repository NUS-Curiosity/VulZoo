Subject: CVE-2024-56717: net: mscc: ocelot: fix incorrect IFH SRC_PORT field in ocelot_ifh_set_basic()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: mscc: ocelot: fix incorrect IFH SRC_PORT field in ocelot_ifh_set_basic()

Packets injected by the CPU should have a SRC_PORT field equal to the
CPU port module index in the Analyzer block (ocelot->num_phys_ports).

The blamed commit copied the ocelot_ifh_set_basic() call incorrectly
from ocelot_xmit_common() in net/dsa/tag_ocelot.c. Instead of calling
with "x", it calls with BIT_ULL(x), but the field is not a port mask,
but rather a single port index.

[ side note: this is the technical debt of code duplication :( ]

The error used to be silent and doesn't appear to have other
user-visible manifestations, but with new changes in the packing
library, it now fails loudly as follows:

------------[ cut here ]------------
Cannot store 0x40 inside bits 46-43 - will truncate

The code path pertains to the ocelot switchdev driver and to the felix
secondary DSA tag protocol, ocelot-8021q. Here seen with ocelot-8021q.

The messenger (packing) is not really to blame, so fix the original
commit instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56717 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
