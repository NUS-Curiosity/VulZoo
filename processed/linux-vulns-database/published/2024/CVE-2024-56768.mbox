Subject: CVE-2024-56768: bpf: Fix bpf_get_smp_processor_id() on !CONFIG_SMP

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix bpf_get_smp_processor_id() on !CONFIG_SMP

On x86-64 calling bpf_get_smp_processor_id() in a kernel with CONFIG_SMP
disabled can trigger the following bug, as pcpu_hot is unavailable:

 [    8.471774] BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 00000000936a290c
 [    8.471849] #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
 [    8.471881] #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page

Fix by inlining a return 0 in the !CONFIG_SMP case.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56768 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
