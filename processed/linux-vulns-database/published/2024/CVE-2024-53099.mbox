Subject: CVE-2024-53099: bpf: Check validity of link->type in bpf_link_show_fdinfo()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Check validity of link->type in bpf_link_show_fdinfo()

If a newly-added link type doesn't invoke BPF_LINK_TYPE(), accessing
bpf_link_type_strs[link->type] may result in an out-of-bounds access.

To spot such missed invocations early in the future, checking the
validity of link->type in bpf_link_show_fdinfo() and emitting a warning
when such invocations are missed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53099 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
