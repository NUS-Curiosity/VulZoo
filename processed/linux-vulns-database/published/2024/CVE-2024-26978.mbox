Subject: CVE-2024-26978: serial: max310x: fix NULL pointer dereference in I2C instantiation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

serial: max310x: fix NULL pointer dereference in I2C instantiation

When trying to instantiate a max14830 device from userspace:

    echo max14830 0x60 > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/i2c-2/new_device

we get the following error:

    Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address...
    ...
    Call trace:
        max310x_i2c_probe+0x48/0x170 [max310x]
        i2c_device_probe+0x150/0x2a0
    ...

Add check for validity of devtype to prevent the error, and abort probe
with a meaningful error message.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26978 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
