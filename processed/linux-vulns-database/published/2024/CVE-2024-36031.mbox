Subject: CVE-2024-36031: keys: Fix overwrite of key expiration on instantiation

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

keys: Fix overwrite of key expiration on instantiation

The expiry time of a key is unconditionally overwritten during
instantiation, defaulting to turn it permanent. This causes a problem
for DNS resolution as the expiration set by user-space is overwritten to
TIME64_MAX, disabling further DNS updates. Fix this by restoring the
condition that key_set_expiry is only called when the pre-parser sets a
specific expiry.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36031 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
