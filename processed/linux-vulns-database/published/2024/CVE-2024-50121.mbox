Subject: CVE-2024-50121: nfsd: cancel nfsd_shrinker_work using sync mode in nfs4_state_shutdown_net

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfsd: cancel nfsd_shrinker_work using sync mode in nfs4_state_shutdown_net

In the normal case, when we excute `echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads`, the
function `nfs4_state_destroy_net` in `nfs4_state_shutdown_net` will
release all resources related to the hashed `nfs4_client`. If the
`nfsd_client_shrinker` is running concurrently, the `expire_client`
function will first unhash this client and then destroy it. This can
lead to the following warning. Additionally, numerous use-after-free
errors may occur as well.

nfsd_client_shrinker         echo 0 > /proc/fs/nfsd/threads

expire_client                nfsd_shutdown_net
  unhash_client                ...
                               nfs4_state_shutdown_net
                                 /* won't wait shrinker exit */
  /*                             cancel_work(&nn->nfsd_shrinker_work)
   * nfsd_file for this          /* won't destroy unhashed client1 */
   * client1 still alive         nfs4_state_destroy_net
   */

                               nfsd_file_cache_shutdown
                                 /* trigger warning */
                                 kmem_cache_destroy(nfsd_file_slab)
                                 kmem_cache_destroy(nfsd_file_mark_slab)
  /* release nfsd_file and mark */
  __destroy_client

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
