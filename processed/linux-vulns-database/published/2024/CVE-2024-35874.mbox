Subject: CVE-2024-35874: aio: Fix null ptr deref in aio_complete() wakeup

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

aio: Fix null ptr deref in aio_complete() wakeup

list_del_init_careful() needs to be the last access to the wait queue
entry - it effectively unlocks access.

Previously, finish_wait() would see the empty list head and skip taking
the lock, and then we'd return - but the completion path would still
attempt to do the wakeup after the task_struct pointer had been
overwritten.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35874 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/9678bcc6234d83759fe091c197f5017a32b468da
