Subject: CVE-2024-36953: KVM: arm64: vgic-v2: Check for non-NULL vCPU in vgic_v2_parse_attr()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: arm64: vgic-v2: Check for non-NULL vCPU in vgic_v2_parse_attr()

vgic_v2_parse_attr() is responsible for finding the vCPU that matches
the user-provided CPUID, which (of course) may not be valid. If the ID
is invalid, kvm_get_vcpu_by_id() returns NULL, which isn't handled
gracefully.

Similar to the GICv3 uaccess flow, check that kvm_get_vcpu_by_id()
actually returns something and fail the ioctl if not.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36953 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
