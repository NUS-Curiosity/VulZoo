Subject: CVE-2024-36891: maple_tree: fix mas_empty_area_rev() null pointer dereference

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

maple_tree: fix mas_empty_area_rev() null pointer dereference

Currently the code calls mas_start() followed by mas_data_end() if the
maple state is MA_START, but mas_start() may return with the maple state
node == NULL.  This will lead to a null pointer dereference when checking
information in the NULL node, which is done in mas_data_end().

Avoid setting the offset if there is no node by waiting until after the
maple state is checked for an empty or single entry state.

A user could trigger the events to cause a kernel oops by unmapping all
vmas to produce an empty maple tree, then mapping a vma that would cause
the scenario described above.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36891 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
