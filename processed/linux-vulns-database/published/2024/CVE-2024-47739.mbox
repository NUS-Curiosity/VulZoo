Subject: CVE-2024-47739: padata: use integer wrap around to prevent deadlock on seq_nr overflow

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

padata: use integer wrap around to prevent deadlock on seq_nr overflow

When submitting more than 2^32 padata objects to padata_do_serial, the
current sorting implementation incorrectly sorts padata objects with
overflowed seq_nr, causing them to be placed before existing objects in
the reorder list. This leads to a deadlock in the serialization process
as padata_find_next cannot match padata->seq_nr and pd->processed
because the padata instance with overflowed seq_nr will be selected
next.

To fix this, we use an unsigned integer wrap around to correctly sort
padata objects in scenarios with integer overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47739 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
