Subject: CVE-2024-35859: block: fix module reference leakage from bdev_open_by_dev error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: fix module reference leakage from bdev_open_by_dev error path

At the time bdev_may_open() is called, module reference is grabbed
already, hence module reference should be released if bdev_may_open()
failed.

This problem is found by code review.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35859 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
