Subject: CVE-2024-41080: io_uring: fix possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix possible deadlock in io_register_iowq_max_workers()

The io_register_iowq_max_workers() function calls io_put_sq_data(),
which acquires the sqd->lock without releasing the uring_lock.
Similar to the commit 009ad9f0c6ee ("io_uring: drop ctx->uring_lock
before acquiring sqd->lock"), this can lead to a potential deadlock
situation.

To resolve this issue, the uring_lock is released before calling
io_put_sq_data(), and then it is re-acquired after the function call.

This change ensures that the locks are acquired in the correct
order, preventing the possibility of a deadlock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41080 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.9.11 with commit b571a367502c
	Fixed in 6.10 with commit 73254a297c2d

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
