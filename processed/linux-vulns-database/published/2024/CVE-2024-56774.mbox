Subject: CVE-2024-56774: btrfs: add a sanity check for btrfs root in btrfs_search_slot()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: add a sanity check for btrfs root in btrfs_search_slot()

Syzbot reports a null-ptr-deref in btrfs_search_slot().

The reproducer is using rescue=ibadroots, and the extent tree root is
corrupted thus the extent tree is NULL.

When scrub tries to search the extent tree to gather the needed extent
info, btrfs_search_slot() doesn't check if the target root is NULL or
not, resulting the null-ptr-deref.

Add sanity check for btrfs root before using it in btrfs_search_slot().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56774 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
