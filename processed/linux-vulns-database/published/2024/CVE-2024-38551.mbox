Subject: CVE-2024-38551: ASoC: mediatek: Assign dummy when codec not specified for a DAI link

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: mediatek: Assign dummy when codec not specified for a DAI link

MediaTek sound card drivers are checking whether a DAI link is present
and used on a board to assign the correct parameters and this is done
by checking the codec DAI names at probe time.

If no real codec is present, assign the dummy codec to the DAI link
to avoid NULL pointer during string comparison.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38551 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
