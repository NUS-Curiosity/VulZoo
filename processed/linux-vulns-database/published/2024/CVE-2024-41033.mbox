Subject: CVE-2024-41033: cachestat: do not flush stats in recency check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachestat: do not flush stats in recency check

syzbot detects that cachestat() is flushing stats, which can sleep, in its
RCU read section (see [1]).  This is done in the workingset_test_recent()
step (which checks if the folio's eviction is recent).

Move the stat flushing step to before the RCU read section of cachestat,
and skip stat flushing during the recency check.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1d1ba14e00d290b1ed616ed78c8c49bf897ce390
