Subject: CVE-2024-49996: cifs: Fix buffer overflow when parsing NFS reparse points

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cifs: Fix buffer overflow when parsing NFS reparse points

ReparseDataLength is sum of the InodeType size and DataBuffer size.
So to get DataBuffer size it is needed to subtract InodeType's size from
ReparseDataLength.

Function cifs_strndup_from_utf16() is currentlly accessing buf->DataBuffer
at position after the end of the buffer because it does not subtract
InodeType size from the length. Fix this problem and correctly subtract
variable len.

Member InodeType is present only when reparse buffer is large enough. Check
for ReparseDataLength before accessing InodeType to prevent another invalid
memory access.

Major and minor rdev values are present also only when reparse buffer is
large enough. Check for reparse buffer size before calling reparse_mkdev().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49996 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
