Subject: CVE-2024-57920: drm/amdkfd: wq_release signals dma_fence only when available

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdkfd: wq_release signals dma_fence only when available

kfd_process_wq_release() signals eviction fence by
dma_fence_signal() which wanrs if dma_fence
is NULL.

kfd_process->ef is initialized by kfd_process_device_init_vm()
through ioctl. That means the fence is NULL for a new
created kfd_process, and close a kfd_process right
after open it will trigger the warning.

This commit conditionally signals the eviction fence
in kfd_process_wq_release() only when it is available.

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdkfd/kfd_process.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/c8243def299793ac6c85fdc1086089c800c1051a
