Subject: CVE-2024-53118: vsock: Fix sk_error_queue memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Fix sk_error_queue memory leak

Kernel queues MSG_ZEROCOPY completion notifications on the error queue.
Where they remain, until explicitly recv()ed. To prevent memory leaks,
clean up the queue when the socket is destroyed.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bea4779a45f49275b1e1b1bd9de03cd3727244d8
