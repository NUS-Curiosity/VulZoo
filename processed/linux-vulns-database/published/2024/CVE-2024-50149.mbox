Subject: CVE-2024-50149: drm/xe: Don't free job in TDR

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe: Don't free job in TDR

Freeing job in TDR is not safe as TDR can pass the run_job thread
resulting in UAF. It is only safe for free job to naturally be called by
the scheduler. Rather free job in TDR, add to pending list.

(cherry picked from commit ea2f6a77d0c40d97f4a4dc93fee4afe15d94926d)

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50149 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
