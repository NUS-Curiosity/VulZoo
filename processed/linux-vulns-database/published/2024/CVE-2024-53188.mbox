Subject: CVE-2024-53188: wifi: ath12k: fix crash when unbinding

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath12k: fix crash when unbinding

If there is an error during some initialization related to firmware,
the function ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup is called to release resources.
However this is released again when the device is unbinded (ath12k_pci),
and we get:
BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000020
at RIP: 0010:ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup.part.0+0xb6/0x500 [ath12k]
Call Trace:
ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup
ath12k_dp_free
ath12k_core_deinit
ath12k_pci_remove
...

The issue is always reproducible from a VM because the MSI addressing
initialization is failing.

In order to fix the issue, just set to NULL the released structure in
ath12k_dp_cc_cleanup at the end.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53188 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
