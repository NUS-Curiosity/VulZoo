Subject: CVE-2024-38602: ax25: Fix reference count leak issues of ax25_dev

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ax25: Fix reference count leak issues of ax25_dev

The ax25_addr_ax25dev() and ax25_dev_device_down() exist a reference
count leak issue of the object "ax25_dev".

Memory leak issue in ax25_addr_ax25dev():

The reference count of the object "ax25_dev" can be increased multiple
times in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). This will cause a memory leak.

Memory leak issues in ax25_dev_device_down():

The reference count of ax25_dev is set to 1 in ax25_dev_device_up() and
then increase the reference count when ax25_dev is added to ax25_dev_list.
As a result, the reference count of ax25_dev is 2. But when the device is
shutting down. The ax25_dev_device_down() drops the reference count once
or twice depending on if we goto unlock_put or not, which will cause
memory leak.

As for the issue of ax25_addr_ax25dev(), it is impossible for one pointer
to be on a list twice. So add a break in ax25_addr_ax25dev(). As for the
issue of ax25_dev_device_down(), increase the reference count of ax25_dev
once in ax25_dev_device_up() and decrease the reference count of ax25_dev
after it is removed from the ax25_dev_list.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38602 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
