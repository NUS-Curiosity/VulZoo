Subject: CVE-2024-53239: ALSA: 6fire: Release resources at card release

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: 6fire: Release resources at card release

The current 6fire code tries to release the resources right after the
call of usb6fire_chip_abort().  But at this moment, the card object
might be still in use (as we're calling snd_card_free_when_closed()).

For avoid potential UAFs, move the release of resources to the card's
private_free instead of the manual call of usb6fire_chip_destroy() at
the USB disconnect callback.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53239 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
