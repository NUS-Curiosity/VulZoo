Subject: CVE-2024-50133: LoongArch: Don't crash in stack_top() for tasks without vDSO

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Don't crash in stack_top() for tasks without vDSO

Not all tasks have a vDSO mapped, for example kthreads never do. If such
a task ever ends up calling stack_top(), it will derefence the NULL vdso
pointer and crash.

This can for example happen when using kunit:

	[<9000000000203874>] stack_top+0x58/0xa8
	[<90000000002956cc>] arch_pick_mmap_layout+0x164/0x220
	[<90000000003c284c>] kunit_vm_mmap_init+0x108/0x12c
	[<90000000003c1fbc>] __kunit_add_resource+0x38/0x8c
	[<90000000003c2704>] kunit_vm_mmap+0x88/0xc8
	[<9000000000410b14>] usercopy_test_init+0xbc/0x25c
	[<90000000003c1db4>] kunit_try_run_case+0x5c/0x184
	[<90000000003c3d54>] kunit_generic_run_threadfn_adapter+0x24/0x48
	[<900000000022e4bc>] kthread+0xc8/0xd4
	[<9000000000200ce8>] ret_from_kernel_thread+0xc/0xa4

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50133 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
