Subject: CVE-2024-38544: RDMA/rxe: Fix seg fault in rxe_comp_queue_pkt

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/rxe: Fix seg fault in rxe_comp_queue_pkt

In rxe_comp_queue_pkt() an incoming response packet skb is enqueued to the
resp_pkts queue and then a decision is made whether to run the completer
task inline or schedule it. Finally the skb is dereferenced to bump a 'hw'
performance counter. This is wrong because if the completer task is
already running in a separate thread it may have already processed the skb
and freed it which can cause a seg fault.  This has been observed
infrequently in testing at high scale.

This patch fixes this by changing the order of enqueuing the packet until
after the counter is accessed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-38544 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
