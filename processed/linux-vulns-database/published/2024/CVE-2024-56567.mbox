Subject: CVE-2024-56567: ad7780: fix division by zero in ad7780_write_raw()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ad7780: fix division by zero in ad7780_write_raw()

In the ad7780_write_raw() , val2 can be zero, which might lead to a
division by zero error in DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(). The ad7780_write_raw()
is based on iio_info's write_raw. While val is explicitly declared that
can be zero (in read mode), val2 is not specified to be non-zero.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56567 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
