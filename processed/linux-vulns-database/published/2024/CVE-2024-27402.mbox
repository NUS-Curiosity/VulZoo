Subject: CVE-2024-27402: phonet/pep: fix racy skb_queue_empty() use

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

phonet/pep: fix racy skb_queue_empty() use

The receive queues are protected by their respective spin-lock, not
the socket lock. This could lead to skb_peek() unexpectedly
returning NULL or a pointer to an already dequeued socket buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-27402 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
