Subject: CVE-2024-57900: ila: serialize calls to nf_register_net_hooks()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ila: serialize calls to nf_register_net_hooks()

syzbot found a race in ila_add_mapping() [1]

commit 031ae72825ce ("ila: call nf_unregister_net_hooks() sooner")
attempted to fix a similar issue.

Looking at the syzbot repro, we have concurrent ILA_CMD_ADD commands.

Add a mutex to make sure at most one thread is calling nf_register_net_hooks().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
