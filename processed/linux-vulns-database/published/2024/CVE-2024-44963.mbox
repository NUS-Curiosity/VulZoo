Subject: CVE-2024-44963: btrfs: do not BUG_ON() when freeing tree block after error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: do not BUG_ON() when freeing tree block after error

When freeing a tree block, at btrfs_free_tree_block(), if we fail to
create a delayed reference we don't deal with the error and just do a
BUG_ON(). The error most likely to happen is -ENOMEM, and we have a
comment mentioning that only -ENOMEM can happen, but that is not true,
because in case qgroups are enabled any error returned from
btrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_post() (can be -EUCLEAN or anything returned
from btrfs_search_slot() for example) can be propagated back to
btrfs_free_tree_block().

So stop doing a BUG_ON() and return the error to the callers and make
them abort the transaction to prevent leaking space. Syzbot was
triggering this, likely due to memory allocation failure injection.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-44963 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
