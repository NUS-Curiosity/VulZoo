Subject: CVE-2024-26610: wifi: iwlwifi: fix a memory corruption

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: iwlwifi: fix a memory corruption

iwl_fw_ini_trigger_tlv::data is a pointer to a __le32, which means that
if we copy to iwl_fw_ini_trigger_tlv::data + offset while offset is in
bytes, we'll write past the buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-26610 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
