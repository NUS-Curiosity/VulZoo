Subject: CVE-2024-58077: ASoC: soc-pcm: don't use soc_pcm_ret() on .prepare callback

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: soc-pcm: don't use soc_pcm_ret() on .prepare callback

commit 1f5664351410 ("ASoC: lower "no backend DAIs enabled for ... Port"
log severity") ignores -EINVAL error message on common soc_pcm_ret().
It is used from many functions, ignoring -EINVAL is over-kill.

The reason why -EINVAL was ignored was it really should only be used
upon invalid parameters coming from userspace and in that case we don't
want to log an error since we do not want to give userspace a way to do
a denial-of-service attack on the syslog / diskspace.

So don't use soc_pcm_ret() on .prepare callback is better idea.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-58077 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
