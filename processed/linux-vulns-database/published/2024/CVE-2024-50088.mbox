Subject: CVE-2024-50088: btrfs: fix uninitialized pointer free in add_inode_ref()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix uninitialized pointer free in add_inode_ref()

The add_inode_ref() function does not initialize the "name" struct when
it is declared.  If any of the following calls to "read_one_inode()
returns NULL,

	dir = read_one_inode(root, parent_objectid);
	if (!dir) {
		ret = -ENOENT;
		goto out;
	}

	inode = read_one_inode(root, inode_objectid);
	if (!inode) {
		ret = -EIO;
		goto out;
	}

then "name.name" would be freed on "out" before being initialized.

out:
	...
	kfree(name.name);

This issue was reported by Coverity with CID 1526744.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-50088 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
