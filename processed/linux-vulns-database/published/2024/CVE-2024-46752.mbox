Subject: CVE-2024-46752: btrfs: replace BUG_ON() with error handling at update_ref_for_cow()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: replace BUG_ON() with error handling at update_ref_for_cow()

Instead of a BUG_ON() just return an error, log an error message and
abort the transaction in case we find an extent buffer belonging to the
relocation tree that doesn't have the full backref flag set. This is
unexpected and should never happen (save for bugs or a potential bad
memory).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46752 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
