Subject: CVE-2024-56742: vfio/mlx5: Fix an unwind issue in mlx5vf_add_migration_pages()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vfio/mlx5: Fix an unwind issue in mlx5vf_add_migration_pages()

Fix an unwind issue in mlx5vf_add_migration_pages().

If a set of pages is allocated but fails to be added to the SG table,

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
