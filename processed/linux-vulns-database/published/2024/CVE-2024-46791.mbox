Subject: CVE-2024-46791: can: mcp251x: fix deadlock if an interrupt occurs during mcp251x_open

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: mcp251x: fix deadlock if an interrupt occurs during mcp251x_open

The mcp251x_hw_wake() function is called with the mpc_lock mutex held and
disables the interrupt handler so that no interrupts can be processed while
waking the device. If an interrupt has already occurred then waiting for
the interrupt handler to complete will deadlock because it will be trying
to acquire the same mutex.

CPU0                           CPU1
----                           ----
mcp251x_open()
 mutex_lock(&priv->mcp_lock)
  request_threaded_irq()
                               <interrupt>
                               mcp251x_can_ist()
                                mutex_lock(&priv->mcp_lock)
  mcp251x_hw_wake()
   disable_irq() <-- deadlock

Use disable_irq_nosync() instead because the interrupt handler does
everything while holding the mutex so it doesn't matter if it's still
running.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-46791 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
