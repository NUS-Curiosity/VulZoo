Subject: CVE-2024-49570: drm/xe/tracing: Fix a potential TP_printk UAF

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/xe/tracing: Fix a potential TP_printk UAF

The commit
afd2627f727b ("tracing: Check "%s" dereference via the field and not the TP_printk format")
exposes potential UAFs in the xe_bo_move trace event.

Fix those by avoiding dereferencing the
xe_mem_type_to_name[] array at TP_printk time.

Since some code refactoring has taken place, explicit backporting may
be needed for kernels older than 6.10.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-49570 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
