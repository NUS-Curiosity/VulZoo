Subject: CVE-2024-58004: media: intel/ipu6: remove cpu latency qos request on error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: intel/ipu6: remove cpu latency qos request on error

Fix cpu latency qos list corruption like below. It happens when
we do not remove cpu latency request on error path and free
corresponding memory.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
