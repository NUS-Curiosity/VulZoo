Subject: CVE-2024-53085: tpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first

Setting TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED in the end of tpm_pm_suspend() can be racy
according, as this leaves window for tpm_hwrng_read() to be called while
the operation is in progress. The recent bug report gives also evidence of
this behaviour.

Aadress this by locking the TPM chip before checking any chip->flags both
in tpm_pm_suspend() and tpm_hwrng_read(). Move TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED
check inside tpm_get_random() so that it will be always checked only when
the lock is reserved.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-53085 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
