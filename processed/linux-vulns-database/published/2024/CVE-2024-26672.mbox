Subject: CVE-2024-26672: drm/amdgpu: Fix variable 'mca_funcs' dereferenced before NULL check in 'amdgpu_mca_smu_get_mca_entry()'

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amdgpu: Fix variable 'mca_funcs' dereferenced before NULL check in 'amdgpu_mca_smu_get_mca_entry()'

Fixes the below:

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_mca.c:377 amdgpu_mca_smu_get_mca_entry() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'mca_funcs' (see line 368)

357 int amdgpu_mca_smu_get_mca_entry(struct amdgpu_device *adev,
				     enum amdgpu_mca_error_type type,
358                                  int idx, struct mca_bank_entry *entry)
359 {
360         const struct amdgpu_mca_smu_funcs *mca_funcs =
						adev->mca.mca_funcs;
361         int count;
362
363         switch (type) {
364         case AMDGPU_MCA_ERROR_TYPE_UE:
365                 count = mca_funcs->max_ue_count;

mca_funcs is dereferenced here.

366                 break;
367         case AMDGPU_MCA_ERROR_TYPE_CE:
368                 count = mca_funcs->max_ce_count;

mca_funcs is dereferenced here.

369                 break;
370         default:
371                 return -EINVAL;
372         }
373
374         if (idx >= count)
375                 return -EINVAL;
376
377         if (mca_funcs && mca_funcs->mca_get_mca_entry)
	        ^^^^^^^^^

Checked too late!

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_mca.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7b5d58c07024516c0e81b95e98f37710cf402c53
