Subject: CVE-2024-43872: RDMA/hns: Fix soft lockup under heavy CEQE load

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/hns: Fix soft lockup under heavy CEQE load

CEQEs are handled in interrupt handler currently. This may cause the
CPU core staying in interrupt context too long and lead to soft lockup
under heavy load.

Handle CEQEs in BH workqueue and set an upper limit for the number of
CEQE handled by a single call of work handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-43872 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
