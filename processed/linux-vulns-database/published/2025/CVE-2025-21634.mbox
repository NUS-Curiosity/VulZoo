Subject: CVE-2025-21634: cgroup/cpuset: remove kernfs active break

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cgroup/cpuset: remove kernfs active break

A warning was found:

It can be explained by:
rmdir 				echo 1 > cpuset.cpus
				kernfs_fop_write_iter // active=0
cgroup_rm_file
kernfs_remove_by_name_ns	kernfs_get_active // active=1
__kernfs_remove					  // active=0x80000002
kernfs_drain			cpuset_write_resmask
wait_event
//waiting (active == 0x80000001)
				kernfs_break_active_protection
				// active = 0x80000001
// continue
				kernfs_unbreak_active_protection
				// active = 0x80000002
...
kernfs_should_drain_open_files
// warning occurs
				kernfs_put_active

This warning is caused by 'kernfs_break_active_protection' when it is
writing to cpuset.cpus, and the cgroup is removed concurrently.

The commit 3a5a6d0c2b03 ("cpuset: don't nest cgroup_mutex inside
get_online_cpus()") made cpuset_hotplug_workfn asynchronous, This change
involves calling flush_work(), which can create a multiple processes
circular locking dependency that involve cgroup_mutex, potentially leading
to a deadlock. To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 ("cpuset: break
kernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()") added
'kernfs_break_active_protection' in the cpuset_write_resmask. This could
lead to this warning.

After the commit 2125c0034c5d ("cgroup/cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug
processing synchronous"), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs to
wait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpuset
operations are no longer possible. Therefore, the deadlock doesn't exist
anymore and it does not have to 'break active protection' now. To fix this
warning, just remove kernfs_break_active_protection operation in the
'cpuset_write_resmask'.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21634 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
