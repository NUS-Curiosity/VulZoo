Subject: CVE-2025-21645: platform/x86/amd/pmc: Only disable IRQ1 wakeup where i8042 actually enabled it

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86/amd/pmc: Only disable IRQ1 wakeup where i8042 actually enabled it

Wakeup for IRQ1 should be disabled only in cases where i8042 had
actually enabled it, otherwise "wake_depth" for this IRQ will try to
drop below zero and there will be an unpleasant WARN() logged:

kernel: atkbd serio0: Disabling IRQ1 wakeup source to avoid platform firmware bug
kernel: ------------[ cut here ]------------
kernel: Unbalanced IRQ 1 wake disable
kernel: WARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 6431 at kernel/irq/manage.c:920 irq_set_irq_wake+0x147/0x1a0

The PMC driver uses DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() to define its dev_pm_ops
which sets amd_pmc_suspend_handler() to the .suspend, .freeze, and
.poweroff handlers. i8042_pm_suspend(), however, is only set as
the .suspend handler.

Fix the issue by call PMC suspend handler only from the same set of
dev_pm_ops handlers as i8042_pm_suspend(), which currently means just
the .suspend handler.

To reproduce this issue try hibernating (S4) the machine after a fresh boot
without putting it into s2idle first.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
