Subject: CVE-2025-21759: ipv6: mcast: extend RCU protection in igmp6_send()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ipv6: mcast: extend RCU protection in igmp6_send()

igmp6_send() can be called without RTNL or RCU being held.

Extend RCU protection so that we can safely fetch the net pointer
and avoid a potential UAF.

Note that we no longer can use sock_alloc_send_skb() because
ipv6.igmp_sk uses GFP_KERNEL allocations which can sleep.

Instead use alloc_skb() and charge the net->ipv6.igmp_sk
socket under RCU protection.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21759 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
