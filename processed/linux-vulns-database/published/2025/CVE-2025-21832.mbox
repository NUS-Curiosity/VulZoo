Subject: CVE-2025-21832: block: don't revert iter for -EIOCBQUEUED

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: don't revert iter for -EIOCBQUEUED

blkdev_read_iter() has a few odd checks, like gating the position and
count adjustment on whether or not the result is bigger-than-or-equal to
zero (where bigger than makes more sense), and not checking the return
value of blkdev_direct_IO() before doing an iov_iter_revert(). The
latter can lead to attempting to revert with a negative value, which
when passed to iov_iter_revert() as an unsigned value will lead to
throwing a WARN_ON() because unroll is bigger than MAX_RW_COUNT.

Be sane and don't revert for -EIOCBQUEUED, like what is done in other
spots.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21832 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
