Subject: CVE-2025-21736: nilfs2: fix possible int overflows in nilfs_fiemap()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: fix possible int overflows in nilfs_fiemap()

Since nilfs_bmap_lookup_contig() in nilfs_fiemap() calculates its result
by being prepared to go through potentially maxblocks == INT_MAX blocks,
the value in n may experience an overflow caused by left shift of blkbits.

While it is extremely unlikely to occur, play it safe and cast right hand
expression to wider type to mitigate the issue.

Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static analysis
tool SVACE.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21736 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
