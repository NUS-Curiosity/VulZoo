Subject: CVE-2025-21803: LoongArch: Fix warnings during S3 suspend

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: Fix warnings during S3 suspend

The enable_gpe_wakeup() function calls acpi_enable_all_wakeup_gpes(),
and the later one may call the preempt_schedule_common() function,
resulting in a thread switch and causing the CPU to be in an interrupt
enabled state after the enable_gpe_wakeup() function returns, leading
to the warnings as follow.

The root cause is acpi_enable_all_wakeup_gpes() uses a mutex to protect
acpi_hw_enable_all_wakeup_gpes(), and acpi_ut_acquire_mutex() may cause
a thread switch. Since there is no longer concurrent execution during
loongarch_acpi_suspend(), we can call acpi_hw_enable_all_wakeup_gpes()
directly in enable_gpe_wakeup().

The solution is similar to commit 22db06337f590d01 ("ACPI: sleep: Avoid
breaking S3 wakeup due to might_sleep()").

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21803 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
