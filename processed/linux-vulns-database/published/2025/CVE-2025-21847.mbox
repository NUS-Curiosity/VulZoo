Subject: CVE-2025-21847: ASoC: SOF: stream-ipc: Check for cstream nullity in sof_ipc_msg_data()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ASoC: SOF: stream-ipc: Check for cstream nullity in sof_ipc_msg_data()

The nullity of sps->cstream should be checked similarly as it is done in
sof_set_stream_data_offset() function.
Assuming that it is not NULL if sps->stream is NULL is incorrect and can
lead to NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21847 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
