Subject: CVE-2025-21817: block: mark GFP_NOIO around sysfs ->store()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: mark GFP_NOIO around sysfs ->store()

sysfs ->store is called with queue freezed, meantime we have several
->store() callbacks(update_nr_requests, wbt, scheduler) to allocate
memory with GFP_KERNEL which may run into direct reclaim code path,
then potential deadlock can be caused.

Fix the issue by marking NOIO around sysfs ->store()

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21817 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.13.3 with commit 2566ce907e5d5db8a039647208e029ce559baa31
	Fixed in 6.14-rc1 with commit 7c0be4ead1f8f5f8be0803f347de0de81e3b8e1c

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	block/blk-sysfs.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2566ce907e5d5db8a039647208e029ce559baa31
