Subject: CVE-2025-21738: ata: libata-sff: Ensure that we cannot write outside the allocated buffer

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ata: libata-sff: Ensure that we cannot write outside the allocated buffer

reveliofuzzing reported that a SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl with out_len
set to 0xd42, SCSI command set to ATA_16 PASS-THROUGH, ATA command set to
ATA_NOP, and protocol set to ATA_PROT_PIO, can cause ata_pio_sector() to
write outside the allocated buffer, overwriting random memory.

While a ATA device is supposed to abort a ATA_NOP command, there does seem
to be a bug either in libata-sff or QEMU, where either this status is not
set, or the status is cleared before read by ata_sff_hsm_move().
Anyway, that is most likely a separate bug.

Looking at __atapi_pio_bytes(), it already has a safety check to ensure
that __atapi_pio_bytes() cannot write outside the allocated buffer.

Add a similar check to ata_pio_sector(), such that also ata_pio_sector()
cannot write outside the allocated buffer.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21738 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
