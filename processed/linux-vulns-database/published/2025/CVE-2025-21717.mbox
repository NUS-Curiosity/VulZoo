Subject: CVE-2025-21717: net/mlx5e: add missing cpu_to_node to kvzalloc_node in mlx5e_open_xdpredirect_sq

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5e: add missing cpu_to_node to kvzalloc_node in mlx5e_open_xdpredirect_sq

kvzalloc_node is not doing a runtime check on the node argument
(__alloc_pages_node_noprof does have a VM_BUG_ON, but it expands to
nothing on !CONFIG_DEBUG_VM builds), so doing any ethtool/netlink
operation that calls mlx5e_open on a CPU that's larger that MAX_NUMNODES
triggers OOB access and panic (see the trace below).

Add missing cpu_to_node call to convert cpu id to node id.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a275db45b4161d01716559dd7557db9ea0450952
