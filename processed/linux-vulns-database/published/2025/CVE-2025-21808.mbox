Subject: CVE-2025-21808: net: xdp: Disallow attaching device-bound programs in generic mode

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: xdp: Disallow attaching device-bound programs in generic mode

Device-bound programs are used to support RX metadata kfuncs. These
kfuncs are driver-specific and rely on the driver context to read the
metadata. This means they can't work in generic XDP mode. However, there
is no check to disallow such programs from being attached in generic
mode, in which case the metadata kfuncs will be called in an invalid
context, leading to crashes.

Fix this by adding a check to disallow attaching device-bound programs
in generic mode.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21808 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
