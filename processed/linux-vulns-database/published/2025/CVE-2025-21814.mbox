Subject: CVE-2025-21814: ptp: Ensure info->enable callback is always set

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ptp: Ensure info->enable callback is always set

The ioctl and sysfs handlers unconditionally call the ->enable callback.
Not all drivers implement that callback, leading to NULL dereferences.
Example of affected drivers: ptp_s390.c, ptp_vclock.c and ptp_mock.c.

Instead use a dummy callback if no better was specified by the driver.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21814 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
