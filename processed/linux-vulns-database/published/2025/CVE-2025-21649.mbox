Subject: CVE-2025-21649: net: hns3: fix kernel crash when 1588 is sent on HIP08 devices

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: fix kernel crash when 1588 is sent on HIP08 devices

Currently, HIP08 devices does not register the ptp devices, so the
hdev->ptp is NULL. But the tx process would still try to set hardware time
stamp info with SKBTX_HW_TSTAMP flag and cause a kernel crash.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
