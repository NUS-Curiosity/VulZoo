Subject: CVE-2025-21822: ptp: vmclock: Set driver data before its usage

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ptp: vmclock: Set driver data before its usage

If vmclock_ptp_register() fails during probing, vmclock_remove() is
called to clean up the ptp clock and misc device.
It uses dev_get_drvdata() to access the vmclock state.
However the driver data is not yet set at this point.

Assign the driver data earlier.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21822 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/6dbd8b91a065d1d8001446a28e72cd140f9acef0
