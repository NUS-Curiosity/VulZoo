Subject: CVE-2025-21842: amdkfd: properly free gang_ctx_bo when failed to init user queue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

amdkfd: properly free gang_ctx_bo when failed to init user queue

The destructor of a gtt bo is declared as
void amdgpu_amdkfd_free_gtt_mem(struct amdgpu_device *adev, void **mem_obj);
Which takes void** as the second parameter.

GCC allows passing void* to the function because void* can be implicitly
casted to any other types, so it can pass compiling.

However, passing this void* parameter into the function's
execution process(which expects void** and dereferencing void**)
will result in errors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21842 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
