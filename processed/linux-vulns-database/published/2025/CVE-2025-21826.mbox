Subject: CVE-2025-21826: netfilter: nf_tables: reject mismatching sum of field_len with set key length

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

netfilter: nf_tables: reject mismatching sum of field_len with set key length

The field length description provides the length of each separated key
field in the concatenation, each field gets rounded up to 32-bits to
calculate the pipapo rule width from pipapo_init(). The set key length
provides the total size of the key aligned to 32-bits.

Register-based arithmetics still allows for combining mismatching set
key length and field length description, eg. set key length 10 and field
description [ 5, 4 ] leading to pipapo width of 12.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21826 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
