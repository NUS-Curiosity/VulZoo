Subject: CVE-2025-21731: nbd: don't allow reconnect after disconnect

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nbd: don't allow reconnect after disconnect

Following process can cause nbd_config UAF:

1) grab nbd_config temporarily;

2) nbd_genl_disconnect() flush all recv_work() and release the
initial reference:

  nbd_genl_disconnect
   nbd_disconnect_and_put
    nbd_disconnect
     flush_workqueue(nbd->recv_workq)
    if (test_and_clear_bit(NBD_RT_HAS_CONFIG_REF, ...))
     nbd_config_put
     -> due to step 1), reference is still not zero

3) nbd_genl_reconfigure() queue recv_work() again;

  nbd_genl_reconfigure
   config = nbd_get_config_unlocked(nbd)
   if (!config)
   -> succeed
   if (!test_bit(NBD_RT_BOUND, ...))
   -> succeed
   nbd_reconnect_socket
    queue_work(nbd->recv_workq, &args->work)

4) step 1) release the reference;

5) Finially, recv_work() will trigger UAF:

  recv_work
   nbd_config_put(nbd)
   -> nbd_config is freed
   atomic_dec(&config->recv_threads)
   -> UAF

Fix the problem by clearing NBD_RT_BOUND in nbd_genl_disconnect(), so
that nbd_genl_reconfigure() will fail.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21731 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
