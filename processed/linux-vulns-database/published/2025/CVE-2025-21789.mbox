Subject: CVE-2025-21789: LoongArch: csum: Fix OoB access in IP checksum code for negative lengths

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

LoongArch: csum: Fix OoB access in IP checksum code for negative lengths

Commit 69e3a6aa6be2 ("LoongArch: Add checksum optimization for 64-bit
system") would cause an undefined shift and an out-of-bounds read.

Commit 8bd795fedb84 ("arm64: csum: Fix OoB access in IP checksum code
for negative lengths") fixes the same issue on ARM64.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21789 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
