Subject: CVE-2025-21690: scsi: storvsc: Ratelimit warning logs to prevent VM denial of service

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: storvsc: Ratelimit warning logs to prevent VM denial of service

If there's a persistent error in the hypervisor, the SCSI warning for
failed I/O can flood the kernel log and max out CPU utilization,
preventing troubleshooting from the VM side. Ratelimit the warning so
it doesn't DoS the VM.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21690 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
