Subject: CVE-2025-21838: usb: gadget: core: flush gadget workqueue after device removal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: core: flush gadget workqueue after device removal

device_del() can lead to new work being scheduled in gadget->work
workqueue. This is observed, for example, with the dwc3 driver with the
following call stack:
  device_del()
    gadget_unbind_driver()
      usb_gadget_disconnect_locked()
        dwc3_gadget_pullup()
	  dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect()
	    usb_gadget_set_state()
	      schedule_work(&gadget->work)

Move flush_work() after device_del() to ensure the workqueue is cleaned
up.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21838 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
