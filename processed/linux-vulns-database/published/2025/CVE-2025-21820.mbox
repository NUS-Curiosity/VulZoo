Subject: CVE-2025-21820: tty: xilinx_uartps: split sysrq handling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tty: xilinx_uartps: split sysrq handling

lockdep detects the following circular locking dependency:

CPU 0                      CPU 1
========================== ============================
cdns_uart_isr()            printk()
  uart_port_lock(port)       console_lock()
			     cdns_uart_console_write()
                               if (!port->sysrq)
                                 uart_port_lock(port)
  uart_handle_break()
    port->sysrq = ...
  uart_handle_sysrq_char()
    printk()
      console_lock()

The fixed commit attempts to avoid this situation by only taking the
port lock in cdns_uart_console_write if port->sysrq unset. However, if
(as shown above) cdns_uart_console_write runs before port->sysrq is set,
then it will try to take the port lock anyway. This may result in a
deadlock.

Fix this by splitting sysrq handling into two parts. We use the prepare
helper under the port lock and defer handling until we release the lock.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21820 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
