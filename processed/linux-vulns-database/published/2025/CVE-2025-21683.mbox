Subject: CVE-2025-21683: bpf: Fix bpf_sk_select_reuseport() memory leak

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix bpf_sk_select_reuseport() memory leak

As pointed out in the original comment, lookup in sockmap can return a TCP
ESTABLISHED socket. Such TCP socket may have had SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF
set before it was ESTABLISHED. In other words, a non-NULL sk_reuseport_cb
does not imply a non-refcounted socket.

Drop sk's reference in both error paths.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
