Subject: CVE-2025-21641: mptcp: sysctl: blackhole timeout: avoid using current->nsproxy

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: sysctl: blackhole timeout: avoid using current->nsproxy

As mentioned in the previous commit, using the 'net' structure via
'current' is not recommended for different reasons:

- Inconsistency: getting info from the reader's/writer's netns vs only
  from the opener's netns.

- current->nsproxy can be NULL in some cases, resulting in an 'Oops'
  (null-ptr-deref), e.g. when the current task is exiting, as spotted by
  syzbot [1] using acct(2).

The 'pernet' structure can be obtained from the table->data using
container_of().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21641 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
