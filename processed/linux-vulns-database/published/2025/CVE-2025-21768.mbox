Subject: CVE-2025-21768: net: ipv6: fix dst ref loops in rpl, seg6 and ioam6 lwtunnels

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ipv6: fix dst ref loops in rpl, seg6 and ioam6 lwtunnels

Some lwtunnels have a dst cache for post-transformation dst.
If the packet destination did not change we may end up recording
a reference to the lwtunnel in its own cache, and the lwtunnel
state will never be freed.

Discovered by the ioam6.sh test, kmemleak was recently fixed
to catch per-cpu memory leaks. I'm not sure if rpl and seg6
can actually hit this, but in principle I don't see why not.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21768 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
