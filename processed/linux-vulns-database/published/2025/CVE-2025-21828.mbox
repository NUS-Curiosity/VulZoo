Subject: CVE-2025-21828: wifi: mac80211: don't flush non-uploaded STAs

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: mac80211: don't flush non-uploaded STAs

If STA state is pre-moved to AUTHORIZED (such as in IBSS
scenarios) and insertion fails, the station is freed.
In this case, the driver never knew about the station,
so trying to flush it is unexpected and may crash.

Check if the sta was uploaded to the driver before and
fix this.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21828 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
