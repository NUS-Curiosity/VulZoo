Subject: CVE-2025-21732: RDMA/mlx5: Fix a race for an ODP MR which leads to CQE with error

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

RDMA/mlx5: Fix a race for an ODP MR which leads to CQE with error

This patch addresses a race condition for an ODP MR that can result in a
CQE with an error on the UMR QP.

During the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() flow, the following sequence of calls
occurs:

mlx5_revoke_mr()
 mlx5r_umr_revoke_mr()
 mlx5r_umr_post_send_wait()

At this point, the lkey is freed from the hardware's perspective.

However, concurrently, mlx5_ib_invalidate_range() might be triggered by
another task attempting to invalidate a range for the same freed lkey.

This task will:
 - Acquire the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock.
 - Call mlx5r_umr_update_xlt() on the UMR QP.
 - Since the lkey has already been freed, this can lead to a CQE error,
   causing the UMR QP to enter an error state [1].

To resolve this race condition, the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock is now also
acquired as part of the mlx5_revoke_mr() scope.  Upon successful revoke,
we set umem_odp->private which points to that MR to NULL, preventing any
further invalidation attempts on its lkey.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b13d32786acabf70a7b04ed24b7468fc3c82977c
