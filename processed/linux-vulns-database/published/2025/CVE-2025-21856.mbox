Subject: CVE-2025-21856: s390/ism: add release function for struct device

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

s390/ism: add release function for struct device

According to device_release() in /drivers/base/core.c,
a device without a release function is a broken device
and must be fixed.

The current code directly frees the device after calling device_add()
without waiting for other kernel parts to release their references.
Thus, a reference could still be held to a struct device,
e.g., by sysfs, leading to potential use-after-free
issues if a proper release function is not set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21856 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
