Subject: CVE-2025-21726: padata: avoid UAF for reorder_work

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

padata: avoid UAF for reorder_work

Although the previous patch can avoid ps and ps UAF for _do_serial, it
can not avoid potential UAF issue for reorder_work. This issue can
happen just as below:

crypto_request			crypto_request		crypto_del_alg
padata_do_serial
  ...
  padata_reorder
    // processes all remaining
    // requests then breaks
    while (1) {
      if (!padata)
        break;
      ...
    }

				padata_do_serial
				  // new request added
				  list_add
    // sees the new request
    queue_work(reorder_work)
				  padata_reorder
				    queue_work_on(squeue->work)
...

				<kworker context>
				padata_serial_worker
				// completes new request,
				// no more outstanding
				// requests

							crypto_del_alg
							  // free pd

<kworker context>
invoke_padata_reorder
  // UAF of pd

To avoid UAF for 'reorder_work', get 'pd' ref before put 'reorder_work'
into the 'serial_wq' and put 'pd' ref until the 'serial_wq' finish.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21726 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
