Subject: CVE-2025-21788: net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix memleak in certain XDP cases

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: fix memleak in certain XDP cases

If the XDP program doesn't result in XDP_PASS then we leak the
memory allocated by am65_cpsw_build_skb().

It is pointless to allocate SKB memory before running the XDP
program as we would be wasting CPU cycles for cases other than XDP_PASS.
Move the SKB allocation after evaluating the XDP program result.

This fixes the memleak. A performance boost is seen for XDP_DROP test.

XDP_DROP test:
Before: 460256 rx/s                  0 err/s
After:  784130 rx/s                  0 err/s

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21788 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
