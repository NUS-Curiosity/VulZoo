Subject: CVE-2025-21666: vsock: prevent null-ptr-deref in vsock_*[has_data|has_space]

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: prevent null-ptr-deref in vsock_*[has_data|has_space]

Recent reports have shown how we sometimes call vsock_*_has_data()
when a vsock socket has been de-assigned from a transport (see attached
links), but we shouldn't.

Previous commits should have solved the real problems, but we may have
more in the future, so to avoid null-ptr-deref, we can return 0
(no space, no data available) but with a warning.

This way the code should continue to run in a nearly consistent state
and have a warning that allows us to debug future problems.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21666 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
