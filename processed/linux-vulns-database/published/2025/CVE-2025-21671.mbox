Subject: CVE-2025-21671: zram: fix potential UAF of zram table

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

zram: fix potential UAF of zram table

If zram_meta_alloc failed early, it frees allocated zram->table without
setting it NULL.  Which will potentially cause zram_meta_free to access
the table if user reset an failed and uninitialized device.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21671 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
