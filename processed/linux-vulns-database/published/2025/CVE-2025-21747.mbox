Subject: CVE-2025-21747: drm/ast: astdp: Fix timeout for enabling video signal

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/ast: astdp: Fix timeout for enabling video signal

The ASTDP transmitter sometimes takes up to 1 second for enabling the
video signal, while the timeout is only 200 msec. This results in a
kernel error message. Increase the timeout to 1 second. An example
of the error message is shown below.

[  697.084433] ------------[ cut here ]------------

This is a cosmetical problem. Enabling the video signal still works
even with the error message. The problem has always been present, but
only recent versions of the ast driver warn about missing the timeout.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21747 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/589839379031cce220c9cab9f27cb5477195067e
