Subject: CVE-2025-21669: vsock/virtio: discard packets if the transport changes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock/virtio: discard packets if the transport changes

If the socket has been de-assigned or assigned to another transport,
we must discard any packets received because they are not expected
and would cause issues when we access vsk->transport.

A possible scenario is described by Hyunwoo Kim in the attached link,
where after a first connect() interrupted by a signal, and a second
connect() failed, we can find `vsk->transport` at NULL, leading to a
NULL pointer dereference.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21669 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
