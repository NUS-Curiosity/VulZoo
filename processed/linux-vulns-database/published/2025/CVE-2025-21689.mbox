Subject: CVE-2025-21689: USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {
               dev_err(&port->dev,
                       "%s - port change to invalid port: %i\n",
                       __func__, newport);
               break;
       }

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial->num_ports, the assignment of "port" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv->current_port = newport;
       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];

The fix checks if newport is greater than or equal to serial->num_ports
indicating it is out-of-bounds.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21689 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
