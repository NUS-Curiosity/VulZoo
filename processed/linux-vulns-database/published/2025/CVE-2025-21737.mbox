Subject: CVE-2025-21737: ceph: fix memory leak in ceph_mds_auth_match()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ceph: fix memory leak in ceph_mds_auth_match()

We now free the temporary target path substring allocation on every
possible branch, instead of omitting the default branch.  In some
cases, a memory leak occured, which could rapidly crash the system
(depending on how many file accesses were attempted).

This was detected in production because it caused a continuous memory
growth, eventually triggering kernel OOM and completely hard-locking
the kernel.

Relevant kmemleak stacktrace:

    unreferenced object 0xffff888131e69900 (size 128):

It can be triggered by mouting a subdirectory of a CephFS filesystem,
and then trying to access files on this subdirectory with an auth token
using a path-scoped capability:

    $ ceph auth get client.services
    [client.services]
            key = REDACTED
            caps mds = "allow rw fsname=cephfs path=/volumes/"
            caps mon = "allow r fsname=cephfs"
            caps osd = "allow rw tag cephfs data=cephfs"

    $ cat /proc/self/mounts
    services@[REDACTED].cephfs=/volumes/containers /ceph/containers ceph rw,noatime,name=services,secret=<hidden>,ms_mode=prefer-crc,mount_timeout=300,acl,mon_addr=[REDACTED]:3300,recover_session=clean 0 0

    $ seq 1 1000000 | xargs -P32 --replace={} touch /ceph/containers/file-{} && \
    seq 1 1000000 | xargs -P32 --replace={} cat /ceph/containers/file-{}

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
