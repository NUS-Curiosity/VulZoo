Subject: CVE-2025-21656: hwmon: (drivetemp) Fix driver producing garbage data when SCSI errors occur

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hwmon: (drivetemp) Fix driver producing garbage data when SCSI errors occur

scsi_execute_cmd() function can return both negative (linux codes) and
positive (scsi_cmnd result field) error codes.

Currently the driver just passes error codes of scsi_execute_cmd() to
hwmon core, which is incorrect because hwmon only checks for negative
error codes. This leads to hwmon reporting uninitialized data to
userspace in case of SCSI errors (for example if the disk drive was
disconnected).

This patch checks scsi_execute_cmd() output and returns -EIO if it's
error code is positive.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21656 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
