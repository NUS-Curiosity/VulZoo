Subject: CVE-2025-21806: net: let net.core.dev_weight always be non-zero

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: let net.core.dev_weight always be non-zero

The following problem was encountered during stability test:

(NULL net_device): NAPI poll function process_backlog+0x0/0x530 \
	returned 1, exceeding its budget of 0.
------------[ cut here ]------------
list_add double add: new=ffff88905f746f48, prev=ffff88905f746f48, \
	next=ffff88905f746e40.

The reproduction command is as follows:
  sysctl -w net.core.dev_weight=0
  ping 127.0.0.1

This is because when the napi's weight is set to 0, process_backlog() may
return 0 and clear the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit of napi->state, causing this
napi to be re-polled in net_rx_action() until __do_softirq() times out.
Since the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit has been cleared, napi_schedule_rps() can
be retriggered in enqueue_to_backlog(), causing this issue.

Making the napi's weight always non-zero solves this problem.

Triggering this issue requires system-wide admin (setting is
not namespaced).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21806 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
