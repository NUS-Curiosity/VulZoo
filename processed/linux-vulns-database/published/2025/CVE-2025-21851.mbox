Subject: CVE-2025-21851: bpf: Fix softlockup in arena_map_free on 64k page kernel

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: Fix softlockup in arena_map_free on 64k page kernel

On an aarch64 kernel with CONFIG_PAGE_SIZE_64KB=y,
arena_htab tests cause a segmentation fault and soft lockup.
The same failure is not observed with 4k pages on aarch64.

It turns out arena_map_free() is calling
apply_to_existing_page_range() with the address returned by
bpf_arena_get_kern_vm_start().  If this address is not page-aligned
the code ends up calling apply_to_pte_range() with that unaligned
address causing soft lockup.

Fix it by round up GUARD_SZ to PAGE_SIZE << 1 so that the
division by 2 in bpf_arena_get_kern_vm_start() returns
a page-aligned value.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21851 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
