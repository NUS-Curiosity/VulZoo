Subject: CVE-2025-21785: arm64: cacheinfo: Avoid out-of-bounds write to cacheinfo array

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

arm64: cacheinfo: Avoid out-of-bounds write to cacheinfo array

The loop that detects/populates cache information already has a bounds
check on the array size but does not account for cache levels with
separate data/instructions cache. Fix this by incrementing the index
for any populated leaf (instead of any populated level).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21785 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
