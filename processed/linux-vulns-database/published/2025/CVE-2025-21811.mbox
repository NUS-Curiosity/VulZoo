Subject: CVE-2025-21811: nilfs2: protect access to buffers with no active references

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nilfs2: protect access to buffers with no active references

nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers(), which iterates through the buffers
attached to dirty data folios/pages, accesses the attached buffers without
locking the folios/pages.

For data cache, nilfs_clear_folio_dirty() may be called asynchronously
when the file system degenerates to read only, so
nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() still has the potential to cause use
after free issues when buffers lose the protection of their dirty state
midway due to this asynchronous clearing and are unintentionally freed by
try_to_free_buffers().

Eliminate this race issue by adjusting the lock section in this function.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21811 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
