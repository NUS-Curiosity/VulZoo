Subject: CVE-2025-21770: iommu: Fix potential memory leak in iopf_queue_remove_device()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu: Fix potential memory leak in iopf_queue_remove_device()

The iopf_queue_remove_device() helper removes a device from the per-iommu
iopf queue when PRI is disabled on the device. It responds to all
outstanding iopf's with an IOMMU_PAGE_RESP_INVALID code and detaches the
device from the queue.

However, it fails to release the group structure that represents a group
of iopf's awaiting for a response after responding to the hardware. This
can cause a memory leak if iopf_queue_remove_device() is called with
pending iopf's.

Fix it by calling iopf_free_group() after the iopf group is responded.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21770 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/db60d2d896a17decd58d143eef92cf22eb0a0176
