Subject: CVE-2025-21831: PCI: Avoid putting some root ports into D3 on TUXEDO Sirius Gen1

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: Avoid putting some root ports into D3 on TUXEDO Sirius Gen1

commit 9d26d3a8f1b0 ("PCI: Put PCIe ports into D3 during suspend") sets the
policy that all PCIe ports are allowed to use D3.  When the system is
suspended if the port is not power manageable by the platform and won't be
used for wakeup via a PME this sets up the policy for these ports to go
into D3hot.

This policy generally makes sense from an OSPM perspective but it leads to
problems with wakeup from suspend on the TUXEDO Sirius 16 Gen 1 with a
specific old BIOS. This manifests as a system hang.

On the affected Device + BIOS combination, add a quirk for the root port of
the problematic controller to ensure that these root ports are not put into
D3hot at suspend.

This patch is based on

  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230708214457.1229-2-mario.limonciello@amd.com

but with the added condition both in the documentation and in the code to
apply only to the TUXEDO Sirius 16 Gen 1 with a specific old BIOS and only
the affected root ports.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21831 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
