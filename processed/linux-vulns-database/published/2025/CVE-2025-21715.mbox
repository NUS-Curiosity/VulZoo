Subject: CVE-2025-21715: net: davicom: fix UAF in dm9000_drv_remove

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: davicom: fix UAF in dm9000_drv_remove

dm is netdev private data and it cannot be
used after free_netdev() call. Using dm after free_netdev()
can cause UAF bug. Fix it by moving free_netdev() at the end of the
function.

This is similar to the issue fixed in commit
ad297cd2db89 ("net: qcom/emac: fix UAF in emac_remove").

This bug is detected by our static analysis tool.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21715 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
