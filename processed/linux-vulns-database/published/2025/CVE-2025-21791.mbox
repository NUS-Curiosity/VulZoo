Subject: CVE-2025-21791: vrf: use RCU protection in l3mdev_l3_out()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vrf: use RCU protection in l3mdev_l3_out()

l3mdev_l3_out() can be called without RCU being held:

raw_sendmsg()
 ip_push_pending_frames()
  ip_send_skb()
   ip_local_out()
    __ip_local_out()
     l3mdev_ip_out()

Add rcu_read_lock() / rcu_read_unlock() pair to avoid
a potential UAF.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21791 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
