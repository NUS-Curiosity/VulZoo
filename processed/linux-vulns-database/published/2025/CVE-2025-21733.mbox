Subject: CVE-2025-21733: tracing/osnoise: Fix resetting of tracepoints

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tracing/osnoise: Fix resetting of tracepoints

If a timerlat tracer is started with the osnoise option OSNOISE_WORKLOAD
disabled, but then that option is enabled and timerlat is removed, the
tracepoints that were enabled on timerlat registration do not get
disabled. If the option is disabled again and timelat is started, then it
triggers a warning in the tracepoint code due to registering the
tracepoint again without ever disabling it.

Do not use the same user space defined options to know to disable the
tracepoints when timerlat is removed. Instead, set a global flag when it
is enabled and use that flag to know to disable the events.

 ~# echo NO_OSNOISE_WORKLOAD > /sys/kernel/tracing/osnoise/options
 ~# echo timerlat > /sys/kernel/tracing/current_tracer
 ~# echo OSNOISE_WORKLOAD > /sys/kernel/tracing/osnoise/options
 ~# echo nop > /sys/kernel/tracing/current_tracer
 ~# echo NO_OSNOISE_WORKLOAD > /sys/kernel/tracing/osnoise/options
 ~# echo timerlat > /sys/kernel/tracing/current_tracer

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
