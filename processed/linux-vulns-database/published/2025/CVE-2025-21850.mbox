Subject: CVE-2025-21850: nvmet: Fix crash when a namespace is disabled

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvmet: Fix crash when a namespace is disabled

The namespace percpu counter protects pending I/O, and we can
only safely diable the namespace once the counter drop to zero.
Otherwise we end up with a crash when running blktests/nvme/058
(eg for loop transport):

[ 2352.930426] [  T53909] Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000005: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI

as the queue is already torn down when calling submit_bio();

So we need to init the percpu counter in nvmet_ns_enable(), and
wait for it to drop to zero in nvmet_ns_disable() to avoid having
I/O pending after the namespace has been disabled.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21850 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/cc0607594f6813342b27c752c6fb6f6eb9980cb5
