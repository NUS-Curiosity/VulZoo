Subject: CVE-2025-21783: gpiolib: Fix crash on error in gpiochip_get_ngpios()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gpiolib: Fix crash on error in gpiochip_get_ngpios()

The gpiochip_get_ngpios() uses chip_*() macros to print messages.
However these macros rely on gpiodev to be initialised and set,
which is not the case when called via bgpio_init(). In such a case
the printing messages will crash on NULL pointer dereference.
Replace chip_*() macros by the respective dev_*() ones to avoid
such crash.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21783 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
