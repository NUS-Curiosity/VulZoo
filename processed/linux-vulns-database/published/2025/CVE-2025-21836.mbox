Subject: CVE-2025-21836: io_uring/kbuf: reallocate buf lists on upgrade

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/kbuf: reallocate buf lists on upgrade

IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING can reuse an old struct io_buffer_list if it
was created for legacy selected buffer and has been emptied. It violates
the requirement that most of the field should stay stable after publish.
Always reallocate it instead.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21836 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
