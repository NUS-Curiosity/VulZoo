Subject: CVE-2025-21845: mtd: spi-nor: sst: Fix SST write failure

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mtd: spi-nor: sst: Fix SST write failure

'commit 18bcb4aa54ea ("mtd: spi-nor: sst: Factor out common write operation
to `sst_nor_write_data()`")' introduced a bug where only one byte of data
is written, regardless of the number of bytes passed to
sst_nor_write_data(), causing a kernel crash during the write operation.
Ensure the correct number of bytes are written as passed to
sst_nor_write_data().

Call trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
