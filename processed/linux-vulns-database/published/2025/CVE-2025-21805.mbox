Commit 667db86bcbe8 ("RDMA/rtrs: Register ib event handler") introduced a
new element .deinit but never used it at all. Fix it by invoking the
`deinit()` to appropriately unregister the IB event handler.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21805 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
