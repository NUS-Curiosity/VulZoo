Subject: CVE-2025-21786: workqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

workqueue: Put the pwq after detaching the rescuer from the pool

The commit 68f83057b913("workqueue: Reap workers via kthread_stop() and
remove detach_completion") adds code to reap the normal workers but
mistakenly does not handle the rescuer and also removes the code waiting
for the rescuer in put_unbound_pool(), which caused a use-after-free bug
reported by Cheung Wall.

To avoid the use-after-free bug, the poolâ€™s reference must be held until
the detachment is complete. Therefore, move the code that puts the pwq
after detaching the rescuer from the pool.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21786 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
