Subject: CVE-2025-21743: usbnet: ipheth: fix possible overflow in DPE length check

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usbnet: ipheth: fix possible overflow in DPE length check

Originally, it was possible for the DPE length check to overflow if
wDatagramIndex + wDatagramLength > U16_MAX. This could lead to an OoB
read.

Move the wDatagramIndex term to the other side of the inequality.

An existing condition ensures that wDatagramIndex < urb->actual_length.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21743 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
