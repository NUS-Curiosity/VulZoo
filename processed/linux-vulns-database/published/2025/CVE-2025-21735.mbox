Subject: CVE-2025-21735: NFC: nci: Add bounds checking in nci_hci_create_pipe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFC: nci: Add bounds checking in nci_hci_create_pipe()

The "pipe" variable is a u8 which comes from the network.  If it's more
than 127, then it results in memory corruption in the caller,
nci_hci_connect_gate().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21735 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
