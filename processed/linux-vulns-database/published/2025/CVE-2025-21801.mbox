Subject: CVE-2025-21801: net: ravb: Fix missing rtnl lock in suspend/resume path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: ravb: Fix missing rtnl lock in suspend/resume path

Fix the suspend/resume path by ensuring the rtnl lock is held where
required. Calls to ravb_open, ravb_close and wol operations must be
performed under the rtnl lock to prevent conflicts with ongoing ndo
operations.

Without this fix, the following warning is triggered:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/0296981941cf291edfbc318d3255a93439f368e4
