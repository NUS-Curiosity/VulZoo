Subject: CVE-2025-21650: net: hns3: fixed hclge_fetch_pf_reg accesses bar space out of bounds issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: fixed hclge_fetch_pf_reg accesses bar space out of bounds issue

The TQP BAR space is divided into two segments. TQPs 0-1023 and TQPs
1024-1279 are in different BAR space addresses. However,
hclge_fetch_pf_reg does not distinguish the tqp space information when
reading the tqp space information. When the number of TQPs is greater
than 1024, access bar space overwriting occurs.
The problem of different segments has been considered during the
initialization of tqp.io_base. Therefore, tqp.io_base is directly used
when the queue is read in hclge_fetch_pf_reg.

The error message:

Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff800037200000
pc : hclge_fetch_pf_reg+0x138/0x250 [hclge]

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
