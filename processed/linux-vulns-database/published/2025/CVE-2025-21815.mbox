Subject: CVE-2025-21815: mm/compaction: fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mm/compaction: fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning

syzkaller reported a UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warning of (1UL << order)
in isolate_freepages_block().  The bogus compound_order can be any value
because it is union with flags.  Add back the MAX_PAGE_ORDER check to fix
the warning.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
