Subject: CVE-2025-21691: cachestat: fix page cache statistics permission checking

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

cachestat: fix page cache statistics permission checking

When the 'cachestat()' system call was added in commit cf264e1329fb
("cachestat: implement cachestat syscall"), it was meant to be a much
more convenient (and performant) version of mincore() that didn't need
mapping things into the user virtual address space in order to work.

But it ended up missing the "check for writability or ownership" fix for
mincore(), done in commit 134fca9063ad ("mm/mincore.c: make mincore()
more conservative").

This just adds equivalent logic to 'cachestat()', modified for the file
context (rather than vma).

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21691 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
