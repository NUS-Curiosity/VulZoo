Subject: CVE-2025-21651: net: hns3: don't auto enable misc vector

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: don't auto enable misc vector

Currently, there is a time window between misc irq enabled
and service task inited. If an interrupte is reported at
this time, it will cause warning like below:

[   16.324639] Call trace:

So don't auto enable misc vector when request irq..

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21651 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/bcf430d3bb5525fc89a92a0c451c725ba1aa4306
