When too many rdma resources are allocated, rxe needs more time to
handle these rdma resources. Sometimes with the current timeout, rxe
can not release the rdma resources correctly.

Compared with other rdma drivers, a bigger timeout is used.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21829 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
