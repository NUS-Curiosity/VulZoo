Subject: CVE-2025-21655: io_uring/eventfd: ensure io_eventfd_signal() defers another RCU period

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/eventfd: ensure io_eventfd_signal() defers another RCU period

io_eventfd_do_signal() is invoked from an RCU callback, but when
dropping the reference to the io_ev_fd, it calls io_eventfd_free()
directly if the refcount drops to zero. This isn't correct, as any
potential freeing of the io_ev_fd should be deferred another RCU grace
period.

Just call io_eventfd_put() rather than open-code the dec-and-test and
free, which will correctly defer it another RCU grace period.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21655 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
