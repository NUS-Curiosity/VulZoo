Subject: CVE-2025-21723: scsi: mpi3mr: Fix possible crash when setting up bsg fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

scsi: mpi3mr: Fix possible crash when setting up bsg fails

If bsg_setup_queue() fails, the bsg_queue is assigned a non-NULL value.
Consequently, in mpi3mr_bsg_exit(), the condition "if(!mrioc->bsg_queue)"
will not be satisfied, preventing execution from entering
bsg_remove_queue(), which could lead to the following crash:

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 000000000000041c

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
