Subject: CVE-2025-21755: vsock: Orphan socket after transport release

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

vsock: Orphan socket after transport release

During socket release, sock_orphan() is called without considering that it
sets sk->sk_wq to NULL. Later, if SO_LINGER is enabled, this leads to a
null pointer dereferenced in virtio_transport_wait_close().

Orphan the socket only after transport release.

Partially reverts the 'Fixes:' commit.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
