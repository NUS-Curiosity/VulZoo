Subject: CVE-2025-21802: net: hns3: fix oops when unload drivers paralleling

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: hns3: fix oops when unload drivers paralleling

When unload hclge driver, it tries to disable sriov first for each
ae_dev node from hnae3_ae_dev_list. If user unloads hns3 driver at
the time, because it removes all the ae_dev nodes, and it may cause
oops.

But we can't simply use hnae3_common_lock for this. Because in the
process flow of pci_disable_sriov(), it will trigger the remove flow
of VF, which will also take hnae3_common_lock.

To fixes it, introduce a new mutex to protect the unload process.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21802 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
