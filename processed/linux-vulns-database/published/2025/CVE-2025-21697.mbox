Subject: CVE-2025-21697: drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL after job completion

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/v3d: Ensure job pointer is set to NULL after job completion

After a job completes, the corresponding pointer in the device must
be set to NULL. Failing to do so triggers a warning when unloading
the driver, as it appears the job is still active. To prevent this,
assign the job pointer to NULL after completing the job, indicating
the job has finished.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21697 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
