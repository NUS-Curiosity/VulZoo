Subject: CVE-2025-21657: sched_ext: Replace rq_lock() to raw_spin_rq_lock() in scx_ops_bypass()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched_ext: Replace rq_lock() to raw_spin_rq_lock() in scx_ops_bypass()

scx_ops_bypass() iterates all CPUs to re-enqueue all the scx tasks.
For each CPU, it acquires a lock using rq_lock() regardless of whether
a CPU is offline or the CPU is currently running a task in a higher
scheduler class (e.g., deadline). The rq_lock() is supposed to be used
for online CPUs, and the use of rq_lock() may trigger an unnecessary
warning in rq_pin_lock(). Therefore, replace rq_lock() to
raw_spin_rq_lock() in scx_ops_bypass().

Without this change, we observe the following warning:

===== START =====
[    6.615205] rq->balance_callback && rq->balance_callback != &balance_push_callback
[    6.615208] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 0 at kernel/sched/sched.h:1730 __schedule+0x1130/0x1c90
=====  END  =====

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21657 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d9e446dd63cee7161717a6a8414ba9c6435af764
