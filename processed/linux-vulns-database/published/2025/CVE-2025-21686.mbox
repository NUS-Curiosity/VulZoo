Subject: CVE-2025-21686: io_uring/rsrc: require cloned buffers to share accounting contexts

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/rsrc: require cloned buffers to share accounting contexts

When IORING_REGISTER_CLONE_BUFFERS is used to clone buffers from uring
instance A to uring instance B, where A and B use different MMs for
accounting, the accounting can go wrong:
If uring instance A is closed before uring instance B, the pinned memory
counters for uring instance B will be decremented, even though the pinned
memory was originally accounted through uring instance A; so the MM of
uring instance B can end up with negative locked memory.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21686 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
