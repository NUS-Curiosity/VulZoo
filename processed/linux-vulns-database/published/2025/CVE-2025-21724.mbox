Subject: CVE-2025-21724: iommufd/iova_bitmap: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommufd/iova_bitmap: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index()

Resolve a UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds issue in iova_bitmap_offset_to_index()
where shifting the constant "1" (of type int) by bitmap->mapped.pgshift
(an unsigned long value) could result in undefined behavior.

The constant "1" defaults to a 32-bit "int", and when "pgshift" exceeds
31 (e.g., pgshift = 63) the shift operation overflows, as the result
cannot be represented in a 32-bit type.

To resolve this, the constant is updated to "1UL", promoting it to an
unsigned long type to match the operand's type.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21724 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/44d9c94b7a3f29a3e07c4753603a35e9b28842a3
