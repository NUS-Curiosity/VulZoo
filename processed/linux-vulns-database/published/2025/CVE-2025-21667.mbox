Subject: CVE-2025-21667: iomap: avoid avoid truncating 64-bit offset to 32 bits

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iomap: avoid avoid truncating 64-bit offset to 32 bits

on 32-bit kernels, iomap_write_delalloc_scan() was inadvertently using a
32-bit position due to folio_next_index() returning an unsigned long.
This could lead to an infinite loop when writing to an xfs filesystem.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21667 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
