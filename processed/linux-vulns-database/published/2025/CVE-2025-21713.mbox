Subject: CVE-2025-21713: powerpc/pseries/iommu: Don't unset window if it was never set

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/pseries/iommu: Don't unset window if it was never set

On pSeries, when user attempts to use the same vfio container used by
different iommu group, the spapr_tce_set_window() returns -EPERM
and the subsequent cleanup leads to the below crash.

   Kernel attempted to read user page (308) - exploit attempt?
   BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference on read at 0x00000308
   Faulting instruction address: 0xc0000000001ce358
   Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]

Fix this by having null check for the tbl passed to the
spapr_tce_unset_window().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21713 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/b853ff0b514c1df314246fcf94744005914b48cb
