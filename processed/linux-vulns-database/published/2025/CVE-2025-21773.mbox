Subject: CVE-2025-21773: can: etas_es58x: fix potential NULL pointer dereference on udev->serial

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

can: etas_es58x: fix potential NULL pointer dereference on udev->serial

The driver assumed that es58x_dev->udev->serial could never be NULL.
While this is true on commercially available devices, an attacker
could spoof the device identity providing a NULL USB serial number.
That would trigger a NULL pointer dereference.

Add a check on es58x_dev->udev->serial before accessing it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21773 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
