Subject: CVE-2025-21694: fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore (part 2)

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore (part 2)

Since commit 5cbcb62dddf5 ("fs/proc: fix softlockup in __read_vmcore") the
number of softlockups in __read_vmcore at kdump time have gone down, but
they still happen sometimes.

In a memory constrained environment like the kdump image, a softlockup is
not just a harmless message, but it can interfere with things like RCU
freeing memory, causing the crashdump to get stuck.

The second loop in __read_vmcore has a lot more opportunities for natural
sleep points, like scheduling out while waiting for a data write to
happen, but apparently that is not always enough.

Add a cond_resched() to the second loop in __read_vmcore to (hopefully)
get rid of the softlockups.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21694 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
