Subject: CVE-2020-36776: thermal/drivers/cpufreq_cooling: Fix slab OOB issue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

thermal/drivers/cpufreq_cooling: Fix slab OOB issue

Slab OOB issue is scanned by KASAN in cpu_power_to_freq().
If power is limited below the power of OPP0 in EM table,
it will cause slab out-of-bound issue with negative array
index.

Return the lowest frequency if limited power cannot found
a suitable OPP in EM table to fix this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
