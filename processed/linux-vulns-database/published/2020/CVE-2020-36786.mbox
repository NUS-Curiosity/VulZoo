Subject: CVE-2020-36786: media: [next] staging: media: atomisp: fix memory leak of object flash

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

media: [next] staging: media: atomisp: fix memory leak of object flash

In the case where the call to lm3554_platform_data_func returns an
error there is a memory leak on the error return path of object
flash.  Fix this by adding an error return path that will free
flash and rename labels fail2 to fail3 and fail1 to fail2.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2020-36786 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
