Subject: CVE-2020-36779: i2c: stm32f7: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

i2c: stm32f7: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails

The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on
return in these stm32f7_i2c_xx serious functions.

However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment the PM reference
count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result
in a reference leak here.

Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
counter balanced.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2020-36779 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
