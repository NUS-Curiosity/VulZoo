Subject: CVE-2020-36788: drm/nouveau: avoid a use-after-free when BO init fails

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/nouveau: avoid a use-after-free when BO init fails

nouveau_bo_init() is backed by ttm_bo_init() and ferries its return code
back to the caller. On failures, ttm_bo_init() invokes the provided
destructor which should de-initialize and free the memory.

Thus, when nouveau_bo_init() returns an error the gem object has already
been released and the memory freed by nouveau_bo_del_ttm().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2020-36788 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
