Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: RCU protect disk->conv_zones_bitmap

Ensure that a disk revalidation changing the conventional zones bitmap
of a disk does not cause invalid memory references when using the
disk_zone_is_conv() helper by RCU protecting the disk->conv_zones_bitmap
pointer.

disk_zone_is_conv() is modified to operate under the RCU read lock and
the function disk_set_conv_zones_bitmap() is added to update a disk
conv_zones_bitmap pointer using rcu_replace_pointer() with the disk
zone_wplugs_lock spinlock held.

disk_free_zone_resources() is modified to call
disk_update_zone_resources() with a NULL bitmap pointer to free the disk
conv_zones_bitmap. disk_set_conv_zones_bitmap() is also used in
disk_update_zone_resources() to set the new (revalidated) bitmap and
free the old one.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23124 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.12.5 with commit 493326c4f10cc71a42c27fdc97ce112182ee4cbc

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at

will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	block/blk-zoned.c
	include/linux/blkdev.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/493326c4f10cc71a42c27fdc97ce112182ee4cbc
