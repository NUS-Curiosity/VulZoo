Subject: CVE-2025-21818: x86/xen: fix xen_hypercall_hvm() to not clobber %rbx

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/xen: fix xen_hypercall_hvm() to not clobber %rbx

xen_hypercall_hvm(), which is used when running as a Xen PVH guest at
most only once during early boot, is clobbering %rbx. Depending on
whether the caller relies on %rbx to be preserved across the call or
not, this clobbering might result in an early crash of the system.

This can be avoided by using an already saved register instead of %rbx.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-21818 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
