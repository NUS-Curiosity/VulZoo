Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/dp_mst: Fix resetting msg rx state after topology removal

If the MST topology is removed during the reception of an MST down reply
or MST up request sideband message, the
drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::up_req_recv/down_rep_recv states could be reset
from one thread via drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_set_mst(false), racing with
the reading/parsing of the message from another thread via
drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() or drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(). The race is
possible since the reader/parser doesn't hold any lock while accessing
the reception state. This in turn can lead to a memory corruption in the
reader/parser as described by commit bd2fccac61b4 ("drm/dp_mst: Fix MST
sideband message body length check").

Fix the above by resetting the message reception state if needed before
reading/parsing a message. Another solution would be to hold the
drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr::lock for the whole duration of the message
reception/parsing in drm_dp_mst_handle_down_rep() and
drm_dp_mst_handle_up_req(), however this would require a bigger change.
Since the fix is also needed for stable, opting for the simpler solution
in this patch.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2025-23125 to this issue.

	include/drm/display/drm_dp_mst_helper.h


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
