Subject: CVE-2022-49355: xen: unexport __init-annotated xen_xlate_map_ballooned_pages()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen: unexport __init-annotated xen_xlate_map_ballooned_pages()

EXPORT_SYMBOL and __init is a bad combination because the .init.text
section is freed up after the initialization. Hence, modules cannot
use symbols annotated __init. The access to a freed symbol may end up
with kernel panic.

modpost used to detect it, but it has been broken for a decade.

Recently, I fixed modpost so it started to warn it again, then this
showed up in linux-next builds.

There are two ways to fix it:

  - Remove __init
  - Remove EXPORT_SYMBOL

I chose the latter for this case because none of the in-tree call-sites
(arch/arm/xen/enlighten.c, arch/x86/xen/grant-table.c) is compiled as
modular.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49355 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
