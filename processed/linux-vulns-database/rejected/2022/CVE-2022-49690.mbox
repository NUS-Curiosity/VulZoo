Subject: CVE-2022-49690: net/tls: fix tls_sk_proto_close executed repeatedly

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/tls: fix tls_sk_proto_close executed repeatedly

After setting the sock ktls, update ctx->sk_proto to sock->sk_prot by
tls_update(), so now ctx->sk_proto->close is tls_sk_proto_close(). When
close the sock, tls_sk_proto_close() is called for sock->sk_prot->close
is tls_sk_proto_close(). But ctx->sk_proto->close() will be executed later
in tls_sk_proto_close(). Thus tls_sk_proto_close() executed repeatedly
occurred. That will trigger the following bug.

=================================================================
KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000010-0x0000000000000017]
RIP: 0010:tls_sk_proto_close+0xd8/0xaf0 net/tls/tls_main.c:306
Call Trace:
 <TASK>
 tls_sk_proto_close+0x356/0xaf0 net/tls/tls_main.c:329

 __sock_release+0xcd/0x280 net/socket.c:650
 sock_close+0x18/0x20 net/socket.c:1365

Updating a proto which is same with sock->sk_prot is incorrect. Add proto
and sock->sk_prot equality check at the head of tls_update() to fix it.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49690 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
