Subject: CVE-2022-49181: xen: fix is_xen_pmu()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen: fix is_xen_pmu()

is_xen_pmu() is taking the cpu number as parameter, but it is not using
it. Instead it just tests whether the Xen PMU initialization on the
current cpu did succeed. As this test is done by checking a percpu
pointer, preemption needs to be disabled in order to avoid switching
the cpu while doing the test. While resuming from suspend() this seems
not to be the case:

[   88.082751] ACPI: PM: Low-level resume complete
[   88.087933] ACPI: EC: EC started
[   88.091464] ACPI: PM: Restoring platform NVS memory

[   88.137939] Hardware name: Star Labs StarBook/StarBook, BIOS 7.97 03/21/2022
[   88.145930] Call Trace:

[   88.164441]  xen_smp_intr_init_pv+0x75/0x100

Fix that by replacing is_xen_pmu() by a simple boolean variable which
reflects the Xen PMU initialization state on cpu 0.

Modify xen_pmu_init() to return early in case it is being called for a
cpu other than cpu 0 and the boolean variable not being set.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2022-49181 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
