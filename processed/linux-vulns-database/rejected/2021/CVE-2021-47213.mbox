Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

NFSD: Fix exposure in nfsd4_decode_bitmap()

rtm@csail.mit.edu reports:
> nfsd4_decode_bitmap4() will write beyond bmval[bmlen-1] if the RPC
> directs it to do so. This can cause nfsd4_decode_state_protect4_a()
> to write client-supplied data beyond the end of
> nfsd4_exchange_id.spo_must_allow[] when called by
> nfsd4_decode_exchange_id().

Rewrite the loops so nfsd4_decode_bitmap() cannot iterate beyond
@bmlen.

Reported by: rtm@csail.mit.edu

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
	https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/10c22d9519f3f5939de61a1500aa3a926b778d3a
