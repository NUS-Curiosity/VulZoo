Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nfc: fix NULL ptr dereference in llcp_sock_getname() after failed connect

It's possible to trigger NULL pointer dereference by local unprivileged
user, when calling getsockname() after failed bind() (e.g. the bind
fails because LLCP_SAP_MAX used as SAP):

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
  CPU: 1 PID: 426 Comm: llcp_sock_getna Not tainted 5.13.0-rc2-next-20210521+ #9
  Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.14.0-1 04/01/2014
  Call Trace:
   llcp_sock_getname+0xb1/0xe0
   __sys_getpeername+0x95/0xc0
   ? lockdep_hardirqs_on_prepare+0xd5/0x180

This can be reproduced with Syzkaller C repro (bind followed by
getpeername):

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47115 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
