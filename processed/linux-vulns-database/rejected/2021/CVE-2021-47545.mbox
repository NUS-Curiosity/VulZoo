Subject: CVE-2021-47545: perf hist: Fix memory leak of a perf_hpp_fmt

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

perf hist: Fix memory leak of a perf_hpp_fmt

perf_hpp__column_unregister() removes an entry from a list but doesn't

Add the free while at the same time reducing the scope of the function
to static.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
