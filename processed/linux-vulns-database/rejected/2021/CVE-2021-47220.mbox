Subject: CVE-2021-47220: usb: dwc3: core: fix kernel panic when do reboot

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: dwc3: core: fix kernel panic when do reboot

When do system reboot, it calls dwc3_shutdown and the whole debugfs
for dwc3 has removed first, when the gadget tries to do deinit, and
remove debugfs for its endpoints, it meets NULL pointer dereference
issue when call debugfs_lookup. Fix it by removing the whole dwc3
debugfs later than dwc3_drd_exit.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
