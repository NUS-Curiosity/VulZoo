Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

hamradio: improve the incomplete fix to avoid NPD

The previous commit 3e0588c291d6 ("hamradio: defer ax25 kfree after
unregister_netdev") reorder the kfree operations and unregister_netdev
operation to prevent UAF.

This commit improves the previous one by also deferring the nullify of
the ax->tty pointer. Otherwise, a NULL pointer dereference bug occurs.
Partial of the stack trace is shown below.

BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000538
RIP: 0010:ax_xmit+0x1f9/0x400
...

The crash point is shown as below

static void ax_encaps(...) {
  ...
  set_bit(TTY_DO_WRITE_WAKEUP, &ax->tty->flags); // ax->tty = NULL!
  ...
}

By placing the nullify action after the unregister_netdev, the ax->tty
pointer won't be assigned as NULL net_device framework layer is well
synchronized.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47085 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
