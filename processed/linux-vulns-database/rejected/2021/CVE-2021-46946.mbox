Subject: CVE-2021-46946: ext4: fix check to prevent false positive report of incorrect used inodes

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ext4: fix check to prevent false positive report of incorrect used inodes

Commit <50122847007> ("ext4: fix check to prevent initializing reserved
inodes") check the block group zero and prevent initializing reserved
inodes. But in some special cases, the reserved inode may not all belong
to the group zero, it may exist into the second group if we format
filesystem below.

  mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 -g 8192 -N 1024 -I 4096 /dev/sda

So, it will end up triggering a false positive report of a corrupted
file system. This patch fix it by avoid check reserved inodes if no free
inode blocks will be zeroed.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-46946 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
