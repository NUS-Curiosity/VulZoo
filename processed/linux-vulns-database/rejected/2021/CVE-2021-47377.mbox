Subject: CVE-2021-47377: xen/balloon: use a kernel thread instead a workqueue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen/balloon: use a kernel thread instead a workqueue

Today the Xen ballooning is done via delayed work in a workqueue. This
might result in workqueue hangups being reported in case of large
amounts of memory are being ballooned in one go (here 16GB):

BUG: workqueue lockup - pool cpus=6 node=0 flags=0x0 nice=0 stuck for 64s!
Showing busy workqueues and worker pools:
workqueue events: flags=0x0
  pwq 12: cpus=6 node=0 flags=0x0 nice=0 active=2/256 refcnt=3
    in-flight: 229:balloon_process
    pending: cache_reap
workqueue events_freezable_power_: flags=0x84
  pwq 12: cpus=6 node=0 flags=0x0 nice=0 active=1/256 refcnt=2
    pending: disk_events_workfn
workqueue mm_percpu_wq: flags=0x8
  pwq 12: cpus=6 node=0 flags=0x0 nice=0 active=1/256 refcnt=2
    pending: vmstat_update
pool 12: cpus=6 node=0 flags=0x0 nice=0 hung=64s workers=3 idle: 2222 43

This can easily be avoided by using a dedicated kernel thread for doing
the ballooning work.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2021-47377 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
