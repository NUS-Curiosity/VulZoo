Subject: CVE-2023-52802: iio: adc: stm32-adc: harden against NULL pointer deref in stm32_adc_probe()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iio: adc: stm32-adc: harden against NULL pointer deref in stm32_adc_probe()

of_match_device() may fail and returns a NULL pointer.

In practice there is no known reasonable way to trigger this, but
in case one is added in future, harden the code by adding the check

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52802 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
