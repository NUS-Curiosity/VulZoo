Subject: CVE-2023-52665: powerpc/ps3_defconfig: Disable PPC64_BIG_ENDIAN_ELF_ABI_V2

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

powerpc/ps3_defconfig: Disable PPC64_BIG_ENDIAN_ELF_ABI_V2

Commit 8c5fa3b5c4df ("powerpc/64: Make ELFv2 the default for big-endian
builds"), merged in Linux-6.5-rc1 changes the calling ABI in a way
that is incompatible with the current code for the PS3's LV1 hypervisor
calls.

This change just adds the line '# CONFIG_PPC64_BIG_ENDIAN_ELF_ABI_V2 is not set'
to the ps3_defconfig file so that the PPC64_ELF_ABI_V1 is used.

Fixes run time errors like these:

  BUG: Kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0x00000000
  Faulting instruction address: 0xc000000000047cf0
  Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]
  Call Trace:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
