Subject: CVE-2023-52466: PCI: Avoid potential out-of-bounds read in pci_dev_for_each_resource()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

PCI: Avoid potential out-of-bounds read in pci_dev_for_each_resource()

Coverity complains that pointer in the pci_dev_for_each_resource() may be
wrong, i.e., might be used for the out-of-bounds read.

There is no actual issue right now because we have another check afterwards
and the out-of-bounds read is not being performed. In any case it's better
code with this fixed, hence the proposed change.

As Jonas pointed out "It probably makes the code slightly less performant
as res will now be checked for being not NULL (which will always be true),
but I doubt it will be significant (or in any hot paths)."

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52466 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
