Subject: CVE-2023-52756: pwm: Fix double shift bug

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

pwm: Fix double shift bug

These enums are passed to set/test_bit().  The set/test_bit() functions
take a bit number instead of a shifted value.  Passing a shifted value
is a double shift bug like doing BIT(BIT(1)).  The double shift bug
doesn't cause a problem here because we are only checking 0 and 1 but
if the value was 5 or above then it can lead to a buffer overflow.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52756 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
