Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

wifi: ath10k: fix NULL pointer dereference in ath10k_wmi_tlv_op_pull_mgmt_tx_compl_ev()

We should check whether the WMI_TLV_TAG_STRUCT_MGMT_TX_COMPL_EVENT tlv is
present before accessing it, otherwise a null pointer deference error will
occur.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52651 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
