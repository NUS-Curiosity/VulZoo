Subject: CVE-2023-52793: samples/bpf: syscall_tp_user: Fix array out-of-bound access

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

samples/bpf: syscall_tp_user: Fix array out-of-bound access

Commit 06744f24696e ("samples/bpf: Add openat2() enter/exit tracepoint
to syscall_tp sample") added two more eBPF programs to support the
openat2() syscall. However, it did not increase the size of the array
that holds the corresponding bpf_links. This leads to an out-of-bound
access on that array in the bpf_object__for_each_program loop and could
corrupt other variables on the stack. On our testing QEMU, it corrupts
the map1_fds array and causes the sample to fail:

  # ./syscall_tp
  prog #0: map ids 4 5
  verify map:4 val: 5
  map_lookup failed: Bad file descriptor

Dynamically allocate the array based on the number of programs reported
by libbpf to prevent similar inconsistencies in the future

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2023-52793 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
