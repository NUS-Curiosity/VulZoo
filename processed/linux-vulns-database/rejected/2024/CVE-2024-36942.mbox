Subject: CVE-2024-36942: Bluetooth: qca: fix firmware check error path

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Bluetooth: qca: fix firmware check error path

A recent commit fixed the code that parses the firmware files before
downloading them to the controller but introduced a memory leak in case
the sanity checks ever fail.

Make sure to free the firmware buffer before returning on errors.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-36942 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
