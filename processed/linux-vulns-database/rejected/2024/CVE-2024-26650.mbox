Subject: CVE-2024-26650: platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

platform/x86: p2sb: Allow p2sb_bar() calls during PCI device probe

p2sb_bar() unhides P2SB device to get resources from the device. It
guards the operation by locking pci_rescan_remove_lock so that parallel
rescans do not find the P2SB device. However, this lock causes deadlock
when PCI bus rescan is triggered by /sys/bus/pci/rescan. The rescan
locks pci_rescan_remove_lock and probes PCI devices. When PCI devices
call p2sb_bar() during probe, it locks pci_rescan_remove_lock again.
Hence the deadlock.

To avoid the deadlock, do not lock pci_rescan_remove_lock in p2sb_bar().
Instead, do the lock at fs_initcall. Introduce p2sb_cache_resources()
for fs_initcall which gets and caches the P2SB resources. At p2sb_bar(),
refer the cache and return to the caller.

Before operating the device at P2SB DEVFN for resource cache, check
that its device class is PCI_CLASS_MEMORY_OTHER 0x0580 that PCH
specifications define. This avoids unexpected operation to other devices
at the same DEVFN.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
