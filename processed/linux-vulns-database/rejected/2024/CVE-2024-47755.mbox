Subject: CVE-2024-47755: nvdimm: Fix devs leaks in scan_labels()

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

nvdimm: Fix devs leaks in scan_labels()

scan_labels() leaks memory when label scanning fails and it falls back
to just creating a default "seed" namespace for userspace to configure.
Root can force the kernel to leak memory.

Allocate the minimum resources unconditionally and release them when
unneeded to avoid the memory leak.

A kmemleak reports:

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
