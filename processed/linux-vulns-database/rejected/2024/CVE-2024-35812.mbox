Subject: CVE-2024-35812: usb: cdc-wdm: close race between read and workqueue

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: cdc-wdm: close race between read and workqueue

wdm_read() cannot race with itself. However, in
service_outstanding_interrupt() it can race with the
workqueue, which can be triggered by error handling.

Hence we need to make sure that the WDM_RESPONDING
flag is not just only set but tested.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35812 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
