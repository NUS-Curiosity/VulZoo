Subject: CVE-2024-35820: io_uring: fix io_queue_proc modifying req->flags

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring: fix io_queue_proc modifying req->flags

With multiple poll entries __io_queue_proc() might be running in
parallel with poll handlers and possibly task_work, we should not be
carelessly modifying req->flags there. io_poll_double_prepare() handles
a similar case with locking but it's much easier to move it into
__io_arm_poll_handler().

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35820 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
