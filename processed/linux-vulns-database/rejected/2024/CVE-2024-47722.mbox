Subject: CVE-2024-47722: xen: use correct end address of kernel for conflict checking

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

xen: use correct end address of kernel for conflict checking

When running as a Xen PV dom0 the kernel is loaded by the hypervisor
using a different memory map than that of the host. In order to
minimize the required changes in the kernel, the kernel adapts its
memory map to that of the host. In order to do that it is checking
for conflicts of its load address with the host memory map.

Unfortunately the tested memory range does not include the .brk
area, which might result in crashes or memory corruption when this
area does conflict with the memory map of the host.

Fix the test by using the _end label instead of __bss_stop.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-47722 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
