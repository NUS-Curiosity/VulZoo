Subject: CVE-2024-26613: net/rds: Fix UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in rds_cmsg_recv

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/rds: Fix UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in rds_cmsg_recv

Syzcaller UBSAN crash occurs in rds_cmsg_recv(),
which reads inc->i_rx_lat_trace[j + 1] with index 4 (3 + 1),
but with array size of 4 (RDS_RX_MAX_TRACES).
Here 'j' is assigned from rs->rs_rx_trace[i] and in-turn from
trace.rx_trace_pos[i] in rds_recv_track_latency(),
with both arrays sized 3 (RDS_MSG_RX_DGRAM_TRACE_MAX). So fix the
off-by-one bounds check in rds_recv_track_latency() to prevent
a potential crash in rds_cmsg_recv().

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
