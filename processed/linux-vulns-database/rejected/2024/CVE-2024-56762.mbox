Subject: CVE-2024-56762: io_uring/sqpoll: fix sqpoll error handling races

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

io_uring/sqpoll: fix sqpoll error handling races

BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in __lock_acquire+0x370b/0x4a10 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5089
Call Trace:

Kun Hu reports that the SQPOLL creating error path has UAF, which
happens if io_uring_alloc_task_context() fails and then io_sq_thread()
manages to run and complete before the rest of error handling code,
which means io_sq_thread_finish() is looking at already killed task.

Note that this is mostly theoretical, requiring fault injection on
the allocation side to trigger in practice.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-56762 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
