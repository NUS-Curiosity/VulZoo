Subject: CVE-2024-44952: driver core: Fix uevent_show() vs driver detach race

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

driver core: Fix uevent_show() vs driver detach race

uevent_show() wants to de-reference dev->driver->name. There is no clean
way for a device attribute to de-reference dev->driver unless that
attribute is defined via (struct device_driver).dev_groups. Instead, the
anti-pattern of taking the device_lock() in the attribute handler risks
deadlocks with code paths that remove device attributes while holding
the lock.

This deadlock is typically invisible to lockdep given the device_lock()
is marked lockdep_set_novalidate_class(), but some subsystems allocate a
local lockdep key for @dev->mutex to reveal reports of the form:

 ======================================================

 but task is already holding lock:

 which lock already depends on the new lock.

The observation though is that driver objects are typically much longer
lived than device objects. It is reasonable to perform lockless
de-reference of a @driver pointer even if it is racing detach from a
device. Given the infrequency of driver unregistration, use
synchronize_rcu() in module_remove_driver() to close any potential
races.  It is potentially overkill to suffer synchronize_rcu() just to
handle the rare module removal racing uevent_show() event.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
