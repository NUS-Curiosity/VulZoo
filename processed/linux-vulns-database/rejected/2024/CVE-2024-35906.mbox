Subject: CVE-2024-35906: drm/amd/display: Send DTBCLK disable message on first commit

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

drm/amd/display: Send DTBCLK disable message on first commit

[Why]
Previous patch to allow DTBCLK disable didn't address boot case. Driver
thinks DTBCLK is disabled by default, so we don't send disable message to
PMFW. DTBCLK is then enabled at idle desktop on boot, burning power.

[How]
Set dtbclk_en to true on boot so that disable message is sent during first
commit.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-35906 to this issue.


Affected and fixed versions
===========================

	Fixed in 6.8.5 with commit 0dab75b433ed
	Fixed in 6.9 with commit f341055b10bd

Please see https://www.kernel.org for a full list of currently supported
kernel versions by the kernel community.

Unaffected versions might change over time as fixes are backported to
older supported kernel versions.  The official CVE entry at
	https://cve.org/CVERecord/?id=CVE-2024-35906
will be updated if fixes are backported, please check that for the most
up to date information about this issue.


Affected files
==============

The file(s) affected by this issue are:
	drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/dc/clk_mgr/dcn35/dcn35_clk_mgr.c


Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
