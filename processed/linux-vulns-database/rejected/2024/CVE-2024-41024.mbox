Subject: CVE-2024-41024: misc: fastrpc: Restrict untrusted app to attach to privileged PD

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

misc: fastrpc: Restrict untrusted app to attach to privileged PD

Untrusted application with access to only non-secure fastrpc device
node can attach to root_pd or static PDs if it can make the respective
init request. This can cause problems as the untrusted application
can send bad requests to root_pd or static PDs. Add changes to reject
attach to privileged PDs if the request is being made using non-secure
fastrpc device node.

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-41024 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
