Subject: CVE-2024-42116: igc: fix a log entry using uninitialized netdev

Description
===========

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

igc: fix a log entry using uninitialized netdev

During successful probe, igc logs this:

[    5.133667] igc 0000:01:00.0 (unnamed net_device) (uninitialized): PHC added
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The reason is that igc_ptp_init() is called very early, even before
register_netdev() has been called. So the netdev_info() call works
on a partially uninitialized netdev.

Fix this by calling igc_ptp_init() after register_netdev(), right
after the media autosense check, just as in igb.  Add a comment,
just as in igb.

Now the log message is fine:

[    5.200987] igc 0000:01:00.0 eth0: PHC added

The Linux kernel CVE team has assigned CVE-2024-42116 to this issue.

Mitigation
==========

The Linux kernel CVE team recommends that you update to the latest
stable kernel version for this, and many other bugfixes.  Individual
changes are never tested alone, but rather are part of a larger kernel
release.  Cherry-picking individual commits is not recommended or
supported by the Linux kernel community at all.  If however, updating to
the latest release is impossible, the individual changes to resolve this
issue can be found at these commits:
