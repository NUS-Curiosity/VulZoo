Curiously we had the same problem when we tried to communicate to
Wordpress the vulnerability CVE-2014-9034
(https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-9034). We
tried, repeatedly, to contact WP through HackerOne and email, but did
not respond. Only through the intervention of the CERT/CC, and last
about six months they showed the necessary interest.
