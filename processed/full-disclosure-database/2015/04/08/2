Subject: Re: [FD] [oss-security] Advisory: CVE-2014-9708: Appweb Web Server

Thanks, Matthew, for having spotted this.
As only current versions of Appweb (4 & 5) have been addressed so far,
but legacy versions (see http://embedthis.com/appweb/download.html) were
not mentioned yet in https://github.com/embedthis/appweb/issues/413 :

- Appweb V3: vulnerable, too
-- Source code audit on Appweb 3.4.2:
The vulnerable code is not in the parseRange() function in
paks/http/httpLib.c, but similarly in http/request.c
-- Verified as vulnerable using a device with Appweb 3.4.1

- Appweb V2: not vulnerable
-- Source code audit on Appweb 2.4.4:
V2 was writtein in C++ (not C), the Range parser is in request.cpp and
handles invalid ranges correctly
-- Verified as not vulnerable using a device with Appweb 2.3.1
