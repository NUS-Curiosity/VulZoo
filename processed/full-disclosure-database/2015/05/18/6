1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Piriform
     Affected Product: CCleaner
     Affected Version: 3.26.0.1988 - 5.02.5101
     Platform: Microsoft Windows 7 x64 Service Pack 1
     CWE Classification: CWE-200: Information Exposure
     Impact: Information Exposure
     Attack vector: Local
     CVE-ID: CVE-2015-3999

2. Vulnerability Description

     The use of CCleaner is encountered at times during forensic
     investigations of computer systems. It has a secure deletion
     mode where it can overwrite data, filenames, and free
     space. Overwriting files and filenames removes the chance to
     recover the data and subject it to further analyses. Due to
     how the software works, CCleaner will actually tell you the
     names of files that it wiped.

3. Technical Description

     Filenames are overwritten with the letter "Z" when CCleaner
     is tasked to overwrite files. On an NTFS formatted drive,
     the filename records in the Master File Table are replaced
     with the letter "Z". For example, a file named "TEST.TXT"
     will have each character in the name overwritten with the
     letter Z and will be renamed to "ZZZZ.ZZZ" after the process is
     completed. For example, as CCleaner was executing, the filename
     "TEST.TXT" was seen being written out to disk a few times,
     followed by the pattern "ZZZZ.ZZZ". The other filenames being
     overwritten were handled in the same fashion. This pattern of
     overwriting filesnames was found in the unallocated space of
     the hard drive. The search results looked like this:

       TEST.TXT
       TEST.TXT
       TEST.TXT
       ZZZZ.ZZZ
       ZZZZ.ZZZ
       ZZZZ.ZZZ

       TEST1.TXT
       TEST1.TXT
       TEST1.TXT
       ZZZZZ.ZZZ
       ZZZZZ.ZZZ
       ZZZZZ.ZZZ

     Once some original filenames are recovered, the analyst can
     attempt to use that to locate other references, or fragments in
     unallocated space, etc.

4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation
