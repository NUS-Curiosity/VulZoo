Subject: [FD] CVE for Apple's ECDHE-ECDSA SecureTransport bug?

Does anyone know if Apple's ECDHE-ECDSA SecureTransport bug was
assigned a CVE? It affected OS X and iOS.

Effectively, the bug was an implementation error that cause
interoperability failures. To mostly counter it, the cipher suites had
to be disabled, which resulted in a loss of security. If the person
experiencing it did not know the cause, then they were left with a
Denial of Service (DoS).

To be clear, this was a different bug than CVE-2015-1130 (Goto Fail).

Also see SSL_OP_SAFARI_ECDHE_ECDSA_BUG on the OpenSSL wiki
(http://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/SSL_OP_SAFARI_ECDHE_ECDSA_BUG).
