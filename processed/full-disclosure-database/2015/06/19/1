Subject: [FD] CVE-2015-4453 - Authentication bypass in OpenEMR

Title: Authentication bypass in OpenEMR
CVE Reference: CVE-2015-4453
Product: OpenEMR
Vendor: http://www.open-emr.org/
Tested versions: 4.2.0 and 4.2.0 patch 1
Affected versions: 2.8.3 to 4.2.0 patch 1
Status: Fixed by vendor
Reported by: Brian D. Hysell

Details:

A bug in OpenEMR's implementation of "fake register_globals" in
interface/globals.php allows an attacker to bypass authentication by
sending ignoreAuth=1 as a GET or POST request parameter.

Impact:

An attacker can access sensitive information without a password in
parts of the application that do not disable the fake register_globals
functionality, do not rely on session data initialized during the
login process, and are not governed by access control lists. Notably,
this includes interface/fax/fax_dispatch_newpid.php and
interface/billing/sl_eob_search.php, which contain unpatched SQL
injection vulnerabilities (see CVE-2014-5462).

Remediation:

Apply vendor's latest patch.

Timeline:

Vendor contacted: May 4, 2015
Vendor replied: May 4
CVE requested: May 6
Patch released: May 9
CVE assigned: June 9
Announced: June 18
