Subject: [FD] CSRF/XSS vulnerability in Private Only could allow an attacker
	to do almost anything an admin user can (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Private Only
Version: 3.5.1
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/private-only/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/csrfxss-vulnerability-in-private-only-could-allow-an-attacker-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-user-can/
CVE: CVE-2015-5483
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF/XSS vulnerability in Private Only could allow an attacker to do almost anything an admin user can

Vulnerability
================
This plugin fails to use CSRF and XSS prevention techniques which are available in WordPress (nonces, and esc_attr()) so it allows an attacker to cause a logged in admin user to be the victim of a CSRF attack which stores malicious content in the database which, due to lack of escaping, is output as raw HTML. Via JavaScript the attacker is able to cause the user’s browser to do almost anything including add users, delete posts, and even modify PHP files if that option hasn’t been disabled.

Proof of concept
================
Pressing the submit button here will change the logo setting to contain some JavaScript. Browsers with no reflected XSS prevention (like Firefox) will execute the JavaScript immediately, other browsers will execute the JavaScript when the page is loaded next.
<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=privateonly.php\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"po_logo\" value=\"&quot;>&lt;script>alert(1)&lt;/script>\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"po_submit\" value=\"Y\">
  <input type=\"submit\">
</form>
