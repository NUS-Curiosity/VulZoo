Subject: [FD] Publicly exploitable XSS in WordPress plugin Navis
	Documentcloud (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Navis DocumentCloud
Version: 0.1
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/navis-documentcloud/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/publicly-exploitable-xss-in-wordpress-plugin-navis-documentcloud/
CVE: CVE-2015-2807
CVSS: 6.4 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Publicly exploitable XSS in WordPress plugin Navis Documentcloud

Vulnerability
================
This plugin contains the following code in js/window.php:
$SITEURL .= $_GET[ ‘wpbase’ ];
// snip
<script src=”https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js”></script>
<script src=”<?php echo $SITEURL; ?>wp-includes/js/tinymce/tiny_mce_popup.js”></script>
Which is a trivially exploitable XSS.
 

Proof of concept
================
Visit the following page on a site with this plugin installed. Note that the plugin need not be active:
http://yourwordpresssite/wp-content/plugins/navis-documentcloud/js/window.php?wpbase=%22%3Ealert(%27xss%27)%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%20src=%22
NB: this proof of concept may not work in browsers with XSS protection features.

Mitigations
================
This plugin is no longer maintained, so if at all possible, switch to using the DocumentCloud plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/documentcloud/.
If this is not possible, upgrade to version 0.1.1 or later.
