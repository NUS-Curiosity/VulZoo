[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]

While reviewing the virtual appliance, five major security issues were
identified:
1) Ability to recover the file system encryption keys via simil cold-boot
   attack;
2) Off-line super user password reset via physical attack;
3) Hard-coded credential for an interactive unprivileged user;
4) Hard-coded SSH key file that could permit local privilege escalation;
5) Various credentials and private IP address of Barracudaâ€™s internal server.

[VULNERABLE VERSIONS]
