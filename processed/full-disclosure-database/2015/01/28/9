         CVE Name       N/A.                                                  

    Description  CVE-2014-8150 reported an HTTP request injection             
                 vulnerability in libcURL. Asterisk uses libcURL in its       
                 func_curl.so module (the CURL() dialplan function), as well  
                 as its res_config_curl.so (cURL realtime backend) modules.   
                                                                              
                 Since Asterisk may be configured to allow for user-supplied  
                 URLs to be passed to libcURL, it is possible that an         
                 attacker could use Asterisk as an attack vector to inject    
                 unauthorized HTTP requests if the version of libcURL         
                 installed on the Asterisk server is affected by              
                 CVE-2014-8150.                                               

    Resolution  Asterisk has been patched with a similar patch as libcURL     
                was for CVE-2014-8150. This means that carriage return and    
                linefeed characters are forbidden from being in HTTP URLs     
                that will be passed to libcURL.
