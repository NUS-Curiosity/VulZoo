Introduction:

-------------

The Xpert.Line software [2] is a Human Resources Management solution that
helps

companies administrating information assets of their employees. It manages

all the private information about the employees. Compass Security [3] found
a

vulnerability that allows an attacker to impersonate other users by only

knowing the username of the person. With this flaw a user can bypass the

authentication mechanism and achieve highest privileges to access personal

information like the salary of any employee or manipulate security settings

(e.g. accounts) of the application.

 

Affected:

---------

Xpert.Line Version 3.0 (Xpert.Center). Other versions have not been tested.

 

Vulnerability Description:

--------------------------

Xpert.Line has several authentication mechanisms to authenticate the user to
the

application. One of the authentication mechanisms relies only on client-side

functionalities. When the Xpert.Line Windows client is started, it first

retrieves the username of the current logged-in Windows user by using an API

call to "getUserNameA" from the Windows built-in library "advapi32.dll".
This

information is then sent to the server to authenticate the user to
Xpert.Line

and it is also used for all subsequent requests to the server.

 

Impact:

-------

A malicious user can impersonate any user by intercepting the above
mentioned

API call to "getUserNameA" in "advapi32.dll" and change the value returned
to

an arbitrary name. This allows impersonating higher privileged users to
access

sensitive information like salary information or to create new administrator

accounts.

 

Workaround / Fix:

-----------------

The affected authentication mechanism can be deactivated. The vendor
currently

is not willing to remove this authentication mechanism. Instead, vendor
offers

more secure authentication mechanisms and considers this a configuration
issue.

 

To deactivate the affected unsecure authentication method do the following:

1. Go to Xpert.Security

2. Got to "change environment" settings

3. Change the authentication type to a secure setting (e.g. LDAPs)
