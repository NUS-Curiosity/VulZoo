Subject: [FD] Reflected XSS in The Events Calendar: Eventbrite Tickets
	allows unauthenticated users to do almost anything an admin
	can (WordPress plugin)

Details
================
Software: The Events Calendar: Eventbrite Tickets
Version: 3.9.6
Homepage: https://theeventscalendar.com/product/wordpress-eventbrite-tickets/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/reflected-xss-in-the-events-calendar-eventbrite-tickets-allows-unauthenticated-users-to-do-almost-anything-an-admin-can/
CVE: CVE-2015-5485
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
Reflected XSS in The Events Calendar: Eventbrite Tickets allows unauthenticated users to do almost anything an admin can

Vulnerability
================
This plugin contains a Reflected XSS vulnerability (views/eventbrite/import-eventbrite-events.php line 14).
This allows an attacker to hijack pages on the site by adding Javascript code into them. For example, an attacker could construct a fake login page on your website and steal an administrator’s password when they log in. There would be almost no way to tell that this was happening.
If an administrator can be tricked into clicking on a link controlled by the attacker, then an attacker would also be able to automate anything an admin could do, for example creating and deleting user accounts and creating and deleting content. There would be almost no way to tell that this was happening, and it is easy to make these links very convincing.

Proof of concept
================
Configure the plugin by creating an Eventbrite account, creating an application, going through the OAuth process, etc.
Using a browser with no XSS prevention (e.g. firefox), visit the following URL:
http://localhost/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=tribe_events&page=import-eventbrite-events&error=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 3.10.2 or later
