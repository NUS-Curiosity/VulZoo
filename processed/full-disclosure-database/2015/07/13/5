Subject: [FD] CVE-2015-1438 - Arbitrary Code Execution [PSKMAD.sys] In Panda
 Security - Multiple Products

Vulnerability title: Arbitrary Code Execution [PSKMAD.sys] In Panda Security - Multiple Products
CVE: CVE-2015-1438
Vendor: Panda Security
Product: Multiple Products
Affected version: 1.0.0.13
Fixed version: 15.1.0
Reported by: Kyriakos Economou
Details:

Panda Kernel Memory Access Driver doesn't validate the size of data to be copied to both an allocated kernel paged pool buffer and to an allocated non-paged pool buffer. Furthermore, the attacker has control over the start-to-copy index regarding the non-paged pool buffer which allows an attacker to corrupt a kernel object with more precision, and control the EIP via a hijacked function pointer.
