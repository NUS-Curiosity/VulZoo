Unauthorized Audit Information Delete via CORBA


1. Impact on Business

4. Affected Components Description
==================================

Business Objects is part of the Business Intelligence platform from SAP.
It has components that provide performance management, planning,
reporting, query and analysis and enterprise information management.

Every Business Objects installation provides a web service to interact
with different platform services.


5. Vulnerability Details
========================

It is possible for an unauthenticated user to remove audit events from a
remote BusinessObjects service using CORBA. Specifically, the attacker
can tell the remote service (i.e. the auditee) to clear an event from
it's queue. After the event is removed from the auditee queue, the
auditor will never have knowledge of the event and, hence, it will not
be written to the Audit database. An attacker can use this to hide their
actions. By default, the auditor polls all auditees every 5 minutes to
ask for events in their queue.

Note, this vulnerability does not allow an attacker to remove events
already written to the database. It only allows events waiting in the
auditee queue to be removed. The clearData CORBA operation is used to
remove the event; authentication is not required.


6. Solution
===========

SAP has released SAP Note 2011396 which provides patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2011396

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
