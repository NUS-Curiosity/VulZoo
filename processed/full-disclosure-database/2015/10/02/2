Advisory Information
Title: vCenter Java JMX/RMI Remote Code Execution
Date Published: 01/10/2015
CVE: CVE-2015-2342
Advisory Summary
VMware vCenter Server provides a centralised platform for managing your
VMware vSphere environments so you can automate and deliver a virtual
infrastructure. VMware vCenter was found to bind an unauthenticated JMX/RMI
service to the network stack. An attacker with access can abuse the
configuration to achieve remote code execution, providing SYSTEM level
access to the server.
Vendor
VMware
Affected Software
VMware ProductVersionPlatform
VMware vCenter Server6.0Any
VMware vCenter Server5.5Any
VMware vCenter Server5.1Any
VMware vCenter Server5.0Any
Description of Issue
VMware¹s vCenter application makes use of Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
technology and supports the use of Java Management extensions (JMX), for
application and network management and monitoring of the JVM. A JMX agent is
setup to allow remote management of the JVM. The JMX agent utilises managed
beans MBeans¹ to expose configured interfaces to manage predefined
configurations. Any objects that are implemented as an MBean and registered
with the agent can be managed from outside the agent¹s Java virtual machine.
The JMX service was found to be configured insecurely as it does not require
authentication, allowing a user to connect and interact with the service.
The JMX service allows users to call the ³javax.management.loading.MLet²
function, which permits the loading of an MBean from a remote URL. An
attacker can set up their remote Web Service to host an MLet (text file)
that points to a malicious JAR file. When the JMX service registers the MLet
file, the agent will initiate the URL to the remote JAR and execute the
methods leading to code execution.

Additional Information
Wider exploit development has already been undertaken against other vendors
utilising JMX/RMI deployments and therefore, publicly available exploit code
already exists that can be used in combination with Metasploit to gain a
remote Meterpreter shell as SYSTEM.
