-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve
Backup. User interaction is not required to exploit this
vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the handling of RPC requests to the Tape
Engine service which listens by default on TCP port 6502 with the
following UUID:

    62b93df0-8b02-11ce-876c-00805f842837

The handler function for RPC opnum 0xBF directly calls user-supplied
data in the RPC request, resulting in trivial arbitrary code execution.

-- Vendor Response:
Computer Associates has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
