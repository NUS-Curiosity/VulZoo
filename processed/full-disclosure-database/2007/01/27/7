Synopsis
========

Sean Larsson from iDefense Labs has found multiple vulnerabilities in
the DBE and Render extensions.

Background
==========

The X Window System is a graphical windowing system based on a
client/server model.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-base/xorg-server     < 1.1.1-r4                   >= 1.1.1-r4

Description
===========

Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities have been found in the
ProcDbeGetVisualInfo() and the ProcDbeSwapBuffers() of the DBE
extension, and ProcRenderAddGlyphs() in the Render extension.

Impact
======

A local attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running the X server, typically root.

Workaround
==========

Disable the dbe and render extension by removing the "Load dbe" and
"Load render" directives in the Module section of xorg.conf.

Note: This could affect the functionality of some applications.

Resolution
==========

All X.Org X server users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-base/xorg-server-1.1.1-r4"
