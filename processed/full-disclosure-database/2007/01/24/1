Synopsis
========

Centericq does not properly handle communications with the LiveJournal
service, allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Centericq is a text mode menu-driven and window-driven instant
messaging interface.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-im/centericq     <= 4.21.0-r2                     Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

When interfacing with the LiveJournal service, Centericq does not
appropriately allocate memory for incoming data, in some cases creating
a buffer overflow.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to connect to an unofficial LiveJournal
server causing Centericq to read specially crafted data from the
server, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running Centericq.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Currently, Centericq is unmaintained. As such, Centericq has been
masked in Portage until it is again maintained.

    # emerge --ask --verbose --unmerge "net-im/centericq"
