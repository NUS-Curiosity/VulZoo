4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in NCTAudioStudio,
NCTAudioEditor, and NCTDialogicVoice, which can be exploited by
malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the
NCTAudioFile2.AudioFile ActiveX control (NCTAudioFile2.dll) when
handling the "SetFormatLikeSample()" method. This can be exploited to
cause a stack-based buffer overflow by passing an overly long string
(about 4124 bytes) as argument to the affected method.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a user
e.g. visits a malicious website.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Set the kill-bit for the affected ActiveX control.

Use another product.
