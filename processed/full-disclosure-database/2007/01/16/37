Synopsis
========

Mono does not properly sanitize pathnames allowing unauthorized
information disclosure.

Background
==========

Mono provides the necessary software to develop and run .NET client and
server applications on various platforms.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/mono      < 1.2.2.1                           >= 1.2.2.1

Description
===========

José Ramón Palanco has discovered that the System.Web class in the
XSP for the ASP.NET server 1.1 through 2.0 in Mono does not properly
validate or sanitize local pathnames which could allow server-side file
content disclosure.

Impact
======

An attacker could append a space character to a URI and obtain
unauthorized access to the source code of server-side files. An
attacker could also read credentials by requesting Web.Config%20 from a
Mono server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mono users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/mono-1.2.2.1"
