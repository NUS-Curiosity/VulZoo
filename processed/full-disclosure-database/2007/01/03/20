Synopsis
========

DenyHosts does not correctly parse log entries, potentially causing a
remote Denial of Service.

Background
==========

DenyHosts is designed to monitor SSH servers for repeated failed login
attempts.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/denyhosts        < 2.6                           >= 2.6

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team discovered that
DenyHosts used an incomplete regular expression to parse failed login
attempts.

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated attacker can add arbitrary hosts to the
blacklist by attempting to login with a specially crafted username. An
attacker may use this to prevent legitimate users from accessing a host
remotely.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All DenyHosts users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/denyhosts-2.6"

References
==========
