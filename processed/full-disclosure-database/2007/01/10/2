 Macromedia ColdFusion Source Code Disclosure Vulnerability

Adobe Macromedia ColdFusion Source Code Disclosure Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.09.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jan 09, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Macromedia ColdFusion is an application server and development
framework for websites. More information is available at the following
URL.

http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an input validation vulnerability in Adobe Systems
Inc.'s Macromedia ColdFusion MX 7 may allow an attacker to view file
contents on the server.

The vulnerability specifically exists in that URL encoded filenames will
be decoded by the IIS process and then again by the ColdFusion process. By
supplying a URL containing a double encoded null byte and an extension
handled by ColdFusion, such as '.cfm', it is possible to view the contents
of any file which is not interpreted by ColdFusion.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation would allow a remote attacker to view the contents
of a file on the affected server. Depending on the layout of the files on
the server, this could include configuration files, source code written in
another scripting language, log files or other data files. Although this
vulnerability does not in itself allow execution of code on the server, it
may allow an attacker to discover sensitive information such as passwords
or to discover vulnerabilities in other scripts on the system or
potentially bypass some security restrictions.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability exists in Adobe Macromedia
ColdFusion MX 7.0.2, with all available fixes, running on Microsoft IIS
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is unaware of any effective workarounds for this vulnerability.
