Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in the SeaMonkey project,
some of which may allow the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver
production-quality releases of code derived from the application
formerly known as the 'Mozilla Application Suite'.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/seamonkey       < 1.0.7                       >= 1.0.7

Description
===========

An anonymous researcher found evidence of memory corruption in the way
SeaMonkey handles certain types of SVG comment DOM nodes. Georgi
Guninski and David Bienvenu discovered buffer overflows in the
processing of long "Content-Type:" and long non-ASCII MIME email
headers. Additionally, Frederik Reiss discovered a heap-based buffer
overflow in the conversion of a CSS cursor. Several other issues with
memory corruption were also fixed. SeaMonkey also contains less severe
vulnerabilities involving JavaScript and Java.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to load malicious JavaScript or a
malicious web page with a SeaMonkey application, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of the user running
those products. An attacker could also perform cross-site scripting
attacks, leading to the exposure of sensitive information, like user
credentials. Note that the execution of JavaScript or Java applets is
disabled by default in the SeaMonkey email client, and enabling it is
strongly discouraged.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.0.7"
