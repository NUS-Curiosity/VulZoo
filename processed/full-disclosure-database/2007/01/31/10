Synopsis
========

ELinks does not properly validate "smb://" URLs, making it vulnerable
to the execution of arbitrary Samba commands.

Background
==========

ELinks is a text mode web browser.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/elinks      < 0.11.2                         >= 0.11.2

Description
===========

Teemu Salmela discovered an error in the validation code of "smb://"
URLs used by ELinks, the same issue as reported in GLSA 200612-16
concerning Links.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to browse to a specially crafted
"smb://" URL and execute arbitrary Samba commands, which would allow
the overwriting of arbitrary local files or the upload or download of
arbitrary files. This vulnerability can be exploited only if
"smbclient" is installed on the victim's computer, which is provided by
the "samba" Gentoo package.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ELinks users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/elinks-0.11.2"
