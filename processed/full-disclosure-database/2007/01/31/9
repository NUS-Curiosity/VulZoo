Synopsis
========

KSirc is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.

Background
==========

KSirc is the default KDE IRC client.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  kde-base/ksirc     < 3.5.5-r1                         >= 3.5.5-r1

Description
===========

KSirc fails to check the size of an incoming PRIVMSG string sent from
an IRC server during the connection process.

Impact
======

A malicious IRC server could send a long PRIVMSG string to the KSirc
client causing an assertion failure and the dereferencing of a null
pointer, resulting in a crash.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All KSirc users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=kde-base/ksirc-3.5.5-r1"
