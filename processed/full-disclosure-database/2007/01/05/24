http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070105-csacs.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2007 January 05 2200 UTC (GMT)

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Certain versions of Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) for
Windows and the Cisco Secure ACS Solution Engine (here after both
referred to as purely Cisco Secure ACS) are affected by multiple
vulnerabilities that cause specific Cisco Secure services to crash.
Two of the vulnerabilities may permit arbitrary code execution after
exploitation of the specified vulnerability.

Affected Cisco Secure ACS services, and the impact of the vulnerabilities 
are as follows:

  * Specially Crafted HTTP GET Request Vulnerability:
    Processing a specially crafted HTTP GET request may crash the CSAdmin
    service. This vulnerability is also susceptible to a stack overflow
    condition.
  * Specially Crafted RADIUS Accounting-Request Vulnerability:
    Processing a specially crafted RADIUS Accounting-Request packet may crash
    the CSRadius service. This vulnerability is also susceptible to a stack
    overflow condition.
  * Specially Crafted RADIUS Access-Request Vulnerabilities:
    Processing a specially crafted RADIUS Access-Request packet may crash the
    CSRadius service.

Cisco has made free software available to address this issue for affected
customers.

We would like to thank CESG's Vulnerability Research Group and National
Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre (NISCC) for reporting
several of these vulnerabilities to Cisco Systems.

We greatly appreciate the opportunity to work with researchers on
security vulnerabilities, and welcome the opportunity to review and
assist in product reports.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20070105-csacs.shtml.

    Copyright information is seen underneath this information.


Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

  * Cisco Secure ACS for Unix (CSU).
  * Cisco CNS Access Registrar (CAR).
  * Cisco Secure ACS server for Windows version 4.1(X) or later.
  * Cisco Secure ACS server solution Engine version 4.1(X) or later.

Details
=======

Cisco Secure ACS is a scalable, high-performance Remote Access Dial-In
User Service (RADIUS) and Terminal Access Controller Access Control
System Plus (TACACS+) security server.

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in certain versions of the Cisco Secure
ACS that may cause the services CSAdmin or CSRadius to crash.

CSAdmin is the service that provides the web server for the ACS web
administration interface.

CSRadius is the service that communicates between the CSAuth module (the
authentication and authorization service) and the access device that is
requesting authentication and authorization services.

Specially Crafted HTTP GET Request Vulnerability:
+------------------------------------------------

This vulnerability is exploited by processing a specially crafted HTTP
GET request. Upon successful exploitation, the CSAdmin service may
crash. This vulnerability is also susceptible to a stack based overflow
condition which may allow arbitrary code execution if successfully
exploited.

If this vulnerability is successfully exploited, the CSAdmin service
will require a manual restart of the service. Normal Authentication,
Authorization and Accounting (AAA) processing will continue.

While CSAdmin is in the stopped state, users cannot access the Cisco
Secure ACS administrative interface from any computer other than the
Windows server or appliance on which it is running. With Cisco Secure
ACS for Windows you can start or stop CSAdmin from the Windows Control
Panel. With Cisco Secure ACS Solution Engine, you can restart the
service by using only the appliance serial console.

For further details on starting the CSAdmin service please refer to: 
http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/access/acs_soft/csacs4nt/acs41/user/a_arch.htm#wp7264

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID:

  * CSCsd96293 -- Stack based overflow within CSAdmin when processing 
    HTTP GET request

Specially Crafted RADIUS Accounting-Request Vulnerability:
+---------------------------------------------------------

This vulnerability is exploited by processing a specially crafted RADIUS
Accounting-Request packet. Upon successful exploitation, the CSRadius
service may crash and an exception trap error will be generated for
the CSRadius service within the Windows Event Viewer System log. This
vulnerability is also susceptible to a stack based overflow condition
which may allow arbitrary code execution if successfully exploited.

The RADIUS secret key that is shared between the Network Access Server
(NAS) and the Cisco Secure ACS server and/or appliance is required to
exploit this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID:

  * CSCse18278 -- Stack based overflow within CSRadius when processing 
    Accounting-Request. (CVE-2006-4098)

Specially Crafted RADIUS Access-Request Vulnerabilities:
+-------------------------------------------------------

Several vulnerabilities exist in Cisco Secure ACS that may cause the
CSRadius service to crash when processing a specially crafted RADIUS
Access-Request packet. These vulnerabilities will not allow arbitrary
code execution after successful exploitation. An exception trap error
will be recorded within the CSRadius log file and an error will be seen
for the CSRadius service within the Windows Event Viewer System log
after successful exploitation.

The RADIUS secret key that is shared between the Network Access Server
(NAS) and the Cisco Secure ACS server and/or appliance is not required
to exploit these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco Bug IDs:

  * CSCse18250 -- CSRadius Service crashes when processing a specially 
    crafted Access-Request packet. (CVE-2006-4097)
  * CSCeg04788 -- CSRadius Service crashes when processing a specially 
    crafted Access-Request packet.
  * CSCeg04666 -- CSRadius Service crashes when processing a specially 
    crafted Access-Request packet.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco is providing scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory based
Con the ommon Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

Cisco will provide a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers
are encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the
environmental impact of a particular vulnerability.

CVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS at
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html.

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute
the environmental impact for individual networks at
http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss.

Workarounds
===========

For Cisco Secure ACS for Windows and Cisco Secure ACS Solution Engine
to help mitigate the risks of these vulnerabilities, the following
mitigations have been provided.

The effectiveness of any mitigation or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied mitigation or fix
is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it is
deployed.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco
Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-air-20070105-csacs.shtml

  * Infrastructure ACLs (iACL)
    Apply access control lists (ACLs) on routers, switches and firewalls that
    filter traffic to the ACS so that traffic is only allowed from stations
    that need to remotely administer the box, or be authenticated, authorized,
    or provide accounting data against/to the ACS server. Refer to 
    http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html for examples on 
    infrastructure ACLs.

  * Anti-Spoofing
    To prevent spoofed IP packets with the source IP address set to that 
    of the Cisco Secure ACS administrative management station from reaching 
    the Cisco Secure ACS server, utilize anti-spoofing techniques. For more 
    information on utilizing ACLs for anti-spoofing, refer to 
    http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/21.pdf and 
    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2827.txt.
    The Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF) feature helps to 
    mitigate problems that are caused by forged IP source addresses that 
    are passing through a router. Refer to 
    http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios122/122cgcr/fsecur_c/fothersf/scfrpf.htm 
    for more information.

products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or fix
is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it is
deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but who do not hold a Cisco
service contract and customers who purchase through third-party vendors
but are unsuccessful at obtaining fixed software through their point
of sale should get their upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical
Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Have your product serial number available and give the URL of this
notice as evidence of your entitlement to a free upgrade. Free upgrades
for non-contract customers must be requested through the TAC.
