Synopsis
========

w3m does not correctly handle format string specifiers in SSL
certificates.

Background
==========

w3m is a multi-platform text-based web browser.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/w3m     < 0.5.1-r4                         >= 0.5.1-r4

Description
===========

w3m in -dump or -backend mode does not correctly handle printf() format
string specifiers in the Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 SSL
certificate.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to visit a malicious website that would
load a specially crafted X.509 SSL certificate containing "%n" or other
format string specifiers, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running w3m.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All w3m users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/w3m-0.5.1-r4"

==========
