Synopsis
========

A truncation error and integer overflows in the EMF/WMF file handling
of OpenOffice.org could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                    /  Vulnerable  /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-office/openoffice-bin       < 2.1.0                  >= 2.1.0
  2  app-office/openoffice           < 2.0.4                  >= 2.0.4
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

John Heasman of NGSSoftware has discovered integer overflows in the
EMR_POLYPOLYGON and EMR_POLYPOLYGON16 processing and an error within
the handling of META_ESCAPE records.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause heap overflows
and potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running OpenOffice.org by enticing the user to open a document
containing a malicious WMF/EMF file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround known at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenOffice.org binary users should update to version 2.1.0 or
later:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-2.1.0"

All OpenOffice.org users should update to version 2.0.4 or later:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.0.4"
