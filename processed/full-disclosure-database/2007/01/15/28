Synopsis
========

WordPress is vulnerable to SQL injection, information disclosure, and
cross-site scripting attacks.

Background
==========

WordPress is a popular personal publishing platform with a web
interface.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/wordpress       < 2.0.6                         >= 2.0.6

Description
===========

When decoding trackbacks with alternate character sets, WordPress does
not correctly sanitize the entries before further modifying a SQL
query. WordPress also displays different error messages in wp-login.php
based upon whether or not a user exists. David Kierznowski has
discovered that WordPress fails to properly sanitize recent file
information in /wp-admin/templates.php before sending that information
to a browser.

Impact
======

An attacker could inject arbitrary SQL into WordPress database queries.
An attacker could also determine if a WordPress user existed by trying
to login as that user, better facilitating brute force attacks. Lastly,
an attacker authenticated to view the administrative section of a
WordPress instance could try to edit a file with a malicious filename;
this may cause arbitrary HTML or JavaScript to be executed in users'
browsers viewing /wp-admin/templates.php.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All WordPress users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/wordpress-2.0.6"
