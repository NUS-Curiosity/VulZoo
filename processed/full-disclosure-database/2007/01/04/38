Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox, some of
which may allow the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                         /  Vulnerable  /       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/mozilla-firefox          < 1.5.0.9          >= 1.5.0.9
  2  www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin      < 1.5.0.9          >= 1.5.0.9
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

An anonymous researcher found evidence of memory corruption in the way
Mozilla Firefox handles certain types of SVG comment DOM nodes.
Additionally, Frederik Reiss discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in
the conversion of a CSS cursor. Other issues with memory corruption
were also fixed. Mozilla Firefox also contains less severe
vulnerabilities involving JavaScript and Java.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web page
that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code. It is also possible for an attacker to
perform cross-site scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of
sensitive information, like user credentials.

Workaround
==========

There are no known workarounds for all the issues at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-1.5.0.9"

All Mozilla Firefox binary release users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-1.5.0.9"
