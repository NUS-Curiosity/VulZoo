Synopsis
========

IPsec-Tools contains a vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to
crash the IPsec tunnel.

Background
==========

IPsec-Tools is a port of KAME's implementation of the IPsec utilities.
It contains a collection of network monitoring tools, including racoon,
ping, and ping6.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-firewall/ipsec-tools       < 0.6.7                   >= 0.6.7

Description
===========

The isakmp_info_recv() function in src/racoon/isakmp_inf.c does not
always check that DELETE (ISAKMP_NPTYPE_D) and NOTIFY (ISAKMP_NPTYPE_N)
packets are encrypted.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted IPsec message to one
of the two peers during the beginning of phase 1, resulting in the
termination of the IPsec exchange.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All IPsec-Tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-firewall/ipsec-tools-0.6.7"

==========
