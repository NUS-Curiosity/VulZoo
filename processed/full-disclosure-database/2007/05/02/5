    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1310

Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package are vulnerable to one
    local user Denial of Service attack in which local users can
    trigger a kernel stack overflow using the netlink layer, and to one
    remote Denial of Service attack in which if IPv6 routing has been
    configured, a remote user can cause the system to use all available
    network bandwidth by sending a specially-crafted IPv6 packet.
    
    In addition, several issues have been resolved that caused some
    systems to have difficulty booting: attempting to initialize the
    Intel random number generator caused some recent systems to hang
    during boot, and NUMA capability was also causing some systems to
    hang during boot and so has been disabled on x86, where it is
    generally not needed.
    
    A system reboot is required to resolve these issues.
