Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in PhpWiki allowing for the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

PhpWiki is an open source content management system written in PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected

  1  www-apps/phpwiki      < 1.3.10-r3                    >= 1.3.10-r3

Description
===========

Harold Hallikainen has reported that the Upload page fails to properly
check the extension of a file.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could upload a specially crafted PHP file to the
vulnerable server, resulting in the execution of arbitrary PHP code
with the privileges of the user running PhpWiki.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution

All PhpWiki users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
