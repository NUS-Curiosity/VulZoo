Synopsis
========

A vulnerability has been discovered in FreeType allowing for
user-assisted remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

FreeType is a True Type Font rendering library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/freetype      < 2.1.10-r3                 >= 2.1.10-r3

Description
===========

Greg MacManus of iDefense Labs has discovered an integer overflow in
the function bdfReadCharacters() when parsing BDF fonts.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to use a specially crafted BDF
font, possibly resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow and the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FreeType users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/freetype-2.1.10-r3"
