Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in Sun Java Development
Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

Background
==========

The Sun Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Sun Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) provide the Sun Java platform.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-java/sun-jdk         < 1.5.0.11                   >= 1.5.0.11
                                                          *>= 1.4.2.14
  2  dev-java/sun-jre-bin     < 1.5.0.11                   >= 1.5.0.11
                                                          *>= 1.4.2.14
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

An unspecified vulnerability involving an "incorrect use of system
classes" was reported by the Fujitsu security team. Additionally, Chris
Evans from the Google Security Team reported an integer overflow
resulting in a buffer overflow in the ICC parser used with JPG or BMP
files, and an incorrect open() call to /dev/tty when processing certain
BMP files.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a specially crafted Java
class or applet that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities. This
could lead to the execution of arbitrary code outside of the Java
sandbox and of the Java security restrictions, or crash the Java
application or the browser.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Sun Java Development Kit users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/sun-jdk"

All Sun Java Runtime Environment users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "dev-java/sun-jre-bin"
