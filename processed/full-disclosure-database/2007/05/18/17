3. Problem description:

Problems addressed by these patches:

a.   Denial-of-Service on Windows based guest operating systems.

     Some VMware products managed memory in a way that failed to
     gracefully handle some general protection faults (GPFs) in Windows
     guest operating systems.

     A malicious user could use this vulnerability to crash Windows
     virtual machines.  While this vulnerability could allow an
     attacker to crash a virtual machine, we do not believe it was
     possible to escalate privileges or escape virtual containment.

     VMware thanks Rub√©n Santamarta of Reversemode for identifying and
     reporting this issue.

     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
     assigned the name CVE-2007-1069 to this issue.

b.   Denial-of-Service using ACPI I/O ports

     Virtual machines can be put in various states of suspension, as
     specified by the ACPI power management standard. When returning
     from a sleep state (S2) to the run state (S0), the virtual machine
     process (VMX) collects information about the last recorded running
     state for the virtual machine.  Under some circumstances, VMX read
     state information from an incorrect memory location. This issue
     could be used to complete a successful Denial-of-Service attack
     where the virtual machine would need to be rebooted.

c.   Denial-of-Service using malformed configuration data

     Some VMware products support storing configuration information
     files. Under some circumstances, a malicious user could instruct
     the virtual machine process (VMX) to store malformed data, causing
     an error. This error could enable a successful Denial-of-Service
     attack on guest operating systems.

     technical security consultants at SunGard iXsecurity.

     has assigned the name CVE-2007-1877 to this issue.

d.   Debugging local programs could create system instability

     In a 64-bit Windows guest on a 64-bit host, debugging local
     programs could create system instability. Using a debugger to step
     into a syscall instruction may corrupt the virtual machine's
     register context. This corruption produces unpredictable results
     including corrupted stack pointers, kernel bugchecks, or vmware-vmx
     process failures.

     Thanks to Ken Johnson for identifying this issue.

     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
     has assigned the name CVE-2007-1876 to this issue.

e.   Directory traversal vulnerability in shared folders feature

     Shared Folders is a feature that enables users of guest operating
     systems to access a specified set of folders in the host's file
     system. A vulnerability was identified by Greg MacManus of iDefense
     Labs that could allow an attacker to write arbitrary content from a
     guest system to arbitrary locations on the host system. In order to
     exploit this vulnerability, the VMware system must have at least
     one folder shared. Although the Shared Folder feature is enabled by
     default, no folders are shared by default, which means this
     vulnerability is not exploitable by default.

     The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
     has assigned the name CVE-2007-1744 to this issue.
