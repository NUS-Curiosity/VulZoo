    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1293

Description:
    Previous versions of xscreensaver are vulnerable to an attack that
    requires that the attacker have physical access.  If the system is
    configured to use remote directory service for login credentials,
    an attacker who can cause or take advantage of a network failure
    can cause the xscreensaver process to crash, unlocking the screen,
    and allowing the attacker unrestricted access to the system as the
    logged-in user.
