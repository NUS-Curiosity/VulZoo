Synopsis
========

Snort contains a vulnerability in the rule matching algorithm that
could result in a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Snort is a widely deployed intrusion detection program.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/snort      < 2.6.1.2                      >= 2.6.1.2

Description
===========

Randy Smith, Christian Estan and Somesh Jha discovered that the rule
matching algorithm of Snort can be exploited in a way known as a
"backtracking attack" to perform numerous time-consuming operations.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted network packets, which
would result in the cessation of the detections and the consumption of
the CPU resources.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Snort users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/snort-2.6.1.2"
