Update
======

The original fix introduced a new vulnerability allowing the listing of
any arbitrary directory with root group permissions due to a typo in the
setgid() call. New fixed packages are available. Also, this update adds
a second CVE reference which was not originally mentionned while it was
covered by the original fix.

Additionally, please note that the Netkit FTP Server package has been
renamed from net-ftp/ftpd to net-ftp/netkit-ftpd.

The updated sections appear below.
