Published: 2007-02-09
Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Major
Exposure Level Classification:
    Indirect Deterministic Denial of Service
Updated Versions:
    kernel=/conary.rpath.com@rpl:devel//1/2.6.19.3-0.1-1

    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-848
    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-963

Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package are vulnerable to a denial
    of service when using the capi bluetooth driver.  rPath Linux
    1 does not include the tools required to configure this driver,
    so rPath Linux 1 has limited exposure to this vulnerability.
    
    This is the first release of the 2.6.19.x kernel for rPath Linux 1,
    which enables significant additional hardware support.  This includes
    support for new hardware in existing drivers, as well as additional
    drivers.
    
    This update requires a system reboot to implement the fixes.
    
    Note: rPath Linux is not vulnerable to several other Linux kernel
    vulnerabilities that have been recently announced, including
    CVE-2006-4814, CVE-2006-5174, CVE-2006-6304, CVE-2006-6053,
    CVE-2006-6054, CVE-2006-4814, and CVE-2006-5823.
