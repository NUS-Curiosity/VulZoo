I tested both the ff and ie version on both Safari 2.0.4 (419.3) and Konqueror 
3.5.5.

On the FF version, konqueror does not exhibit any behavior, lets you input 
text and no redirection is made. To my surprise, the IE version instead dumps 
all the keystrokes typed but does not copy them again into the textarea.
Hitting return causes a dialog "The following files will not be uploaded 
because they could be not be found", and the reason is because the file name 
is the whole input phrase.

On Safari the FF version does not dump anything either, just the first C 
keystroke is took and taken directly into oblivion :). OTOH the IE version 
exhibits the same behavior as konqueror, but the "select file" open dialog 
pops up whenever hitting space.

Regards
