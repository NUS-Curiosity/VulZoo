rPath Security Advisory: 2007-0056-1
Published: 2007-03-16
Products: rPath Linux 1
Rating: Minor
Exposure Level Classification:
    Indirect Deterministic Weakness
Updated Versions:
    gnupg=/conary.rpath.com@rpl:devel//1/1.4.7-0.1-1

    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1111

Description:
    Previous versions of the gnupg package insufficiently distinguish
    signed and unsigned texts, so that programs which call gnupg to
    validate OpenPGP signatures may incorrectly consider a maliciously
    modified message to be signed in its entirety, improperly ignoring
    the presence of unsigned message parts.
