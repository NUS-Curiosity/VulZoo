     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1464

Description:
     Previous versions of the inkscape package are vulnerable to attacks 
which would allow unauthorized system access at the permission level of 
the user running inkscape (usually non-root). One attack vector is by 
coercing a user into opening a specially crafted URI, while the other 
requires that the user be logged into a malicious jabber server using 
the client provided in inkscape.
