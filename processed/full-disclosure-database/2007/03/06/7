    https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1106

Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package are vulnerable to multiple
    local user attacks.
    
    One vulnerability is a local user denial of service (system crash)
    due to a bug in the key_alloc_serial() function.
    
    The second vulnerability is a local user attack in which a call to
    the listxattr() system call on a bad inode will at least corrupt
    memory in the calling process, and may allow a malicious program
    to read protected kernel memory (information exposure, possibly
    enabling other vulnerabilities), system crash, or even executing
    arbitrary code provided by the attacker.  Bad inodes are not present
    on most systems, so in practice the attack will require that the
    user be able to mount a filesystem.
