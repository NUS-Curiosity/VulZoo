Synopsis
========

Squid is affected by a Denial of Service vulnerability.

Background
==========

Squid is a multi-protocol proxy server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-proxy/squid      < 2.6.12                           >= 2.6.12

Description
===========

Squid incorrectly handles TRACE requests that contain a "Max-Forwards"
header field with value "0" in the clientProcessRequest() function.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can send specially crafted TRACE HTTP requests that
will terminate the child process. A quickly repeated attack will lead
to a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/squid-2.6.12"

==========
