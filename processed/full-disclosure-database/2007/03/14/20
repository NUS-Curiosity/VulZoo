Synopsis
========

The SSH Secure Shell Server SFTP function is vulnerable to privilege
escalation.

Background
==========

The SSH Secure Shell Server from SSH Communications Security
(www.ssh.com) is a commercial SSH implementation available free for
non-commercial use.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/ssh       < 4.3.7                            Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

The SSH Secure Shell Server contains a format string vulnerability in
the SFTP code that handles file transfers (scp2 and sftp2). In some
situations, this code passes the accessed filename to the system log.
During this operation, an unspecified error could allow uncontrolled
stack access.

Impact
======

An authenticated system user may be able to exploit this vulnerability
to bypass command restrictions, or run commands as another user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

This package is currently masked, there is no upgrade path for the
3.2.x version, and a license must be purchased in order to update to a
non-vulnerable version. Because of this, we recommend unmerging this
package:

    # emerge --ask --verbose --unmerge net-misc/ssh
