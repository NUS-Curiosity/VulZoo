I have rolled out a new Technika browser extension. It is very small
and extremely fast. Technika also integrates with Firebug, so you can
easily test and compose Bookmarklets on the fly. The article that I
pointed above discusses how Bookmarklets can be used to compose web
app exploits. There is a framework similar to metasploit that will
come out very soon. I thought that it might be a good idea to share
these ideas now, so the community knows what to expect in the future.
Thanks.

Package        : lookup-el
Vulnerability  : insecure temporary file
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2007-0237

Tatsuya Kinoshita discovered that Lookup, a search interface to
electronic dictionaries on emacsen, creates a temporary file in an
insecure fashion when the ndeb-binary feature is used, which allows a
local attacker to craft a symlink attack to overwrite arbitrary files.

For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-3sarge1.

For the testing distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your lookup-el package.


Upgrade Instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given at the end of this advisory:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.

Good Afternoon,
I'm seeing wide-spread spam attacks across several different shared
hosting
servers, operated by multiple companies. The attacks forge emails on the
fly, and follow a pattern. The spam first takes the client's domain
name,
for example, plastic.com. Then adds the word "nac" to the beginning, and
"gaf" to the end, making the from email address
nacplasticgaf@...stic.com .
If the domain were rockin.com, the email would be
nacrockingaf@...kin.com .
Byob.com, nacbyobgaf@...b.com, etc.

Has anyone else noticed this trend this afternoon? It seems they just
started a couple of hours ago. It doesn't seem like a security risk,
just
standard forging of email headers. The main company I work for makes use
of
SPF, however not every mail server on the internet makes use of it. I'm
only
submitting this because it seems like a wide-spread issue this
afternoon.

All the best,
Mike Bailey

  Severity: High
     Title: ulogd: Remote execution of arbitrary code
      Date: March 18, 2007
      Bugs: #161882
        ID: 200703-17

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Synopsis
========

ulogd contains a possible buffer overflow potentially allowing for the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

ulogd is a userspace daemon for netfilter related logging.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/ulogd      < 1.23-r1                         >= 1.23-r1

Description
===========

SUSE reported unspecified buffer overflows in ulogd involving the
calculation of string lengths.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could trigger a possible buffer overflow through
unspecified vectors, potentially leading to the remote execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running the ulogd daemon, or
more probably leading to the crash of the daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ulogd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/ulogd-1.23-r1"

     Title: Mozilla Thunderbird: Multiple vulnerabilities
      Date: March 18, 2007
      Bugs: #165555
        ID: 200703-18

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Thunderbird,
some of which may allow user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

Background
==========

Mozilla Thunderbird is a popular open-source email client from the
Mozilla Project.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mozilla-thunderbird         < 1.5.0.10                >= 1.5.0.10
  2  mozilla-thunderbird-bin     < 1.5.0.10                >= 1.5.0.10
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Georgi Guninski reported a possible integer overflow in the code
handling text/enhanced or text/richtext MIME emails. Additionally,
various researchers reported errors in the JavaScript engine
potentially leading to memory corruption. Additionally, the binary
version of Mozilla Thunderbird includes a vulnerable NSS library which
contains two possible buffer overflows involving the SSLv2 protocol.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to read a specially crafted email that
could trigger one of the vulnerabilities, some of them being related to
Mozilla Thunderbird's handling of JavaScript, possibly leading to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time for all of these issues, but
some of them can be avoided by disabling JavaScript. Note that the
execution of JavaScript is disabled by default and enabling it is
strongly discouraged.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-1.5.0.10"

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-1.5.0.10"

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Synopsis
========

LTSP includes a version of libVNCServer that is vulnerable to an
authentication bypass.

Background
==========

The Linux Terminal Server Project adds thin-client support to Linux
servers.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/ltsp      < 4.2-r1                             >= 4.2-r1

Description
===========

The LTSP server includes vulnerable LibVNCServer code, which fails to
properly validate protocol types effectively letting users decide what
protocol to use, such as "Type 1 - None" (GLSA-200608-05). The LTSP VNC
server will accept this security type, even if it is not offered by the
server.

Impact
======

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized
access with the privileges of the user running the VNC server.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All LTSP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/ltsp-4.2-r1"

        ID: 200703-20

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Synopsis
========

LSAT insecurely creates temporary files which can lead to symlink
attacks allowing a local user to overwrite arbitrary files.

Background
==========

The Linux Security Auditing Tool (LSAT) is a post install security
auditor which checks many system configurations and local network
settings on the system for common security or configuration errors and
for packages that are not needed.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-admin/lsat      <= 0.9.2                          Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

LSAT insecurely writes in /tmp with a predictable filename.

Impact
======

A local attacker could create symbolic links in the temporary files
directory, pointing to a valid file somewhere on the filesystem. When
the LSAT script is executed, this would result in the file being
overwritten with the rights of the user running the software, which
could be the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Since LSAT is not actively maintained anymore, this package has been
masked. All LSAT users are advised to unmerge it.

    
    # emerge --ask --unmerge "app-admin/lsat"

Availability
============

This GLSA and any updates to it are available for viewing at
the Gentoo Security Website:

Nice find.  There's a common problem when an organization gets so large
that
the right hand doesn't talk to the left.  I'm not sure what the
AuthToken
would be useful for, I don't see it anywhere in my authenticated request
(e.g. not in the cookie or any other data).  The XSS is more nasty than
the
XML data though, because from what I can tell a login to gmail sets a
cookie
for .google.com, allowing you to use your same XSS to get the contact
list
from a one-click (or XSRF) attack to the gmail call which returns the
same
contact list.  Both are nasty because they're serving up that data over
non-SSL channels.
