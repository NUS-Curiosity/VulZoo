Synopsis
========

Wordpress contains several cross-site scripting, cross-site request
forgery and information leak vulnerabilities.

Background
==========

WordPress is a popular personal publishing platform with a web
interface.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/wordpress      <= 2.1.2                      Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

WordPress contains cross-site scripting or cross-site scripting forgery
vulnerabilities reported by:

* g30rg3_x in the "year" parameter of the wp_title() function

* Alexander Concha in the "demo" parameter of wp-admin/admin.php

* Samenspender and Stefan Friedli in the "post" parameter of
  wp-admin/post.php and wp-admin/page.php, in the "cat_ID" parameter of
  wp-admin/categories.php and in the "c" parameter of
  wp-admin/comment.php

* PsychoGun in the "file" parameter of wp-admin/templates.php

Additionally, WordPress prints the full PHP script paths in some error
messages.

Impact
======

The cross-site scripting vulnerabilities can be triggered to steal
browser session data or cookies. A remote attacker can entice a user to
browse to a specially crafted web page that can trigger the cross-site
request forgery vulnerability and perform arbitrary WordPress actions
with the permissions of the user. Additionally, the path disclosure
vulnerability could help an attacker to perform other attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time for all these
vulnerabilities.

Resolution
==========

Due to the numerous recently discovered vulnerabilities in WordPress,
this package has been masked in the portage tree. All WordPress users
are advised to unmerge it.

    
    # emerge --unmerge "www-apps/wordpress"
