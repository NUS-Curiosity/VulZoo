Description:
    Previous versions of the firefox package are vulnerable to several
    types of attacks, some of which are understood to allow compromised
    or malicious sites to run arbitrary code as the user running the
    firefox browser.
    
    2 March 2007 Update: The vulnerabilities previously resolved in the
    firefox have now been resolved in the thunderbird package as well.
