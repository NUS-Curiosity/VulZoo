 OfficeScan Management Console Authorization Bypass Vulnerability

Trend Micro OfficeScan Management Console Authorization Bypass Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.16.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 16, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Trend Micro OfficeScan is a centrally managed AntiVirus solution that
allows administrators to manage virus and spyware protection in
business environments. More information can be found on the vendors
site at the following URL.

http://us.trendmicro.com/us/products/enterprise/officescan-client-server-edition/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an authorization bypass vulnerability in Trend
Micro Inc.'s OfficeScan for Windows could allow attackers to login to
the management console and alter application settings.

The OfficeScan installation includes a web management console that
allows administrators to configure the application and the Antivirus
clients it manages. The web interface login is handled by
cgiChkMasterPwd.exe which is passed a hash and an encrypted version of
the password generated by an ActiveX control on the login page.

If cgiChkMasterPwd.exe is sent an empty encryption string and empty hash
it proceeds to issue the client a valid session id which can then be
used to access the web management console.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to manage the OfficeScan application
settings and the setting of the antivirus clients which it controls.

IV. DETECTION
