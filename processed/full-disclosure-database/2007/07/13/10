Advisory: ActiveWeb Contentserver CMS Multiple Cross Site Scriptings 

RedTeam Pentesting discovered three Cross Site Scripting
vulnerabilities in the activeWeb contentserver CMS during a penetration
test. One of the Cross Site Scriptings is persistent.


Details
=======

Product: activeWeb contentserver
Affected Versions: <= 5.6.2929
Fixed Versions: 5.6.2964
Vulnerability Type: Cross Site Scripting
Security-Risk: high
Vendor-URL: http://www.active-web.de/aw/home/Produkte/~gf/contentserver/
Vendor-Status: informed, fixed version released
Advisory-URL: http://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2007-005.php
Advisory-Status: public
CVE: CVE-2007-3014
CVE-URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3014


Introduction
============

contentserver is the comprehensive, scalable Content Management System
for professional requirements. It combines editorial system, website
management and development platform for web applications in one package.

(translation of the description on the vendor's homepage)


XSS Error Page rights.asp
=========================

The variable "msg" of the ASP script "rights.asp" is not properly
filtered.

Proof of Concept
----------------

http://www.example.com/errors/rights.asp
  ?awReadAccessRight=True
  &msg=<script>alert('XSS')</script>


XSS Error Page transaction.asp
==============================

The variable "msg" of the ASP script "transaction.asp" is not properly
filtered.

Proof of Concept
----------------

http://www.example.com/errors/transaction.asp
  ?msg=<script>alert('XSS')</script>


Persistent XSS Mimetypes
========================

As editors, users can add new mimetypes to the the system. The name of
the new mimetype can contain arbitrary code. This allows for a
persistent Cross Site Scripting.

Proof of Concept
----------------

As an editor, log into the management interface and add a new mimetype.
For the name, use a script, e.g.

<script>alert('XSS')</script>

Everytime a user looks at the mimetypes, the code will be executed.


Workaround
==========

A possible workaround would be to use a filtering application set up in
front of the real webserver, mitigating the risk of being exploited.


Fix
===

The vulnerability is fixed in release 5.6.2964.


Security Risk
=============

The risk is high, as these XSS can be used e.g. to steal session cookies
of logged-in users.
