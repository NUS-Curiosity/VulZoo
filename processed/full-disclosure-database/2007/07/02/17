Synopsis
========

The IMAP client of Evolution contains a vulnerability potentially
leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Evolution is the mail client of the GNOME desktop environment. Camel is
the Evolution Data Server module that handles mail functions.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                            /  Vulnerable  /    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  gnome-extra/evolution-data-server     < 1.8.3-r5      >= 1.8.3-r5
                                                          *>= 1.6.2-r1

Description
===========

The imap_rescan() function of the file camel-imap-folder.c does not
properly sanitize the "SEQUENCE" response sent by an IMAP server before
being used to index arrays.

Impact
======

A malicious or compromised IMAP server could trigger the vulnerability
and execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running
Evolution.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Evolution users should upgrade evolution-data-server to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose "gnome-extra/evolution-data-server"
