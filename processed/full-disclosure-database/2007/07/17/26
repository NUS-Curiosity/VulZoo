 Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment TFTP Blocksize DoS Vulnerability

IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment TFTP Blocksize DoS
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.17.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 17, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

IBM Corp.'s Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment is a network
boot server that facilitates central management of networked
workstations. It implements Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), a
Web-based administration service, DHCP, TFTP, and several additional
protocols. More information can be found at the following URL.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service vulnerability within version
5.1.0.2 of IBM Corp.'s Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment
allows attackers to deny service to all product functionality.

This vulnerability specifically exists in the TFTP protocol
implementation. When processing a read request (RRQ), an integer
division by zero error can be triggered by supplying an invalid
"blksize" argument. This exception is not handled and will result in
the rembo.exe service terminating.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to cause the service to terminate
unexpectedly due to an exception that occurs when dividing by zero.

No authentication is required to access the vulnerable code. The
attacker need only be able to send a specially crafted request to the
TFTP port (UDP port 69) of the vulnerable machine.

This will deny service to all functionality provided by this service.
This includes DHCP, TFTP, PXE, HTTP, HTTPS, as well as several other
services.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in version
5.1.0.2 of IBM Corp.'s Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment.
Version 5.1.0.116 was tested and found not to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Employing firewalls to limit access to the affected service will
mitigate exposure to this vulnerability.
