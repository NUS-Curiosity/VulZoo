 eDirectory NCP Fragment Denial of Service Vulnerability

Novell eDirectory NCP Fragment Denial of Service Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.26.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 26, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Novell eDirectory is a cross-platform lightweight directory access
protocol (LDAP) server. In addition to LDAP, eDirectory also implements
NCP over IP. More information can be found on Novell's web site at the
following URL.

http://www.novell.com/products/edirectory/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in Novell
Inc.'s eDirectory product could allow an attacker to force the running
daemon to cease servicing requests.

The problem specifically exists within the NCP functionality of
eDirectory. Sending a sequence of specially crafted fragmented requests
will cause a DoS condition.

If the input is crafted properly, eDirectory will report to its error
log that a fragment has been received with an invalid length. The error
message includes the contents of the fragments in hexadecimal notation.
However, if the length is negative, eDirectory will try to dump data to
the log indefinitely. This results in a large amount of data being saved
to the log. Once the end of the heap segment is reached, a memory access
violation will occur and the server process will crash.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to
crash the server process. No credentials are required. Repeated attacks
could allow the attacker to cause excessive disk space usage.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in version
8.8.1 of Novell Inc.'s eDirectory server with FTF1 applied. The
earliest version tested was 8.8. Earlier versions are suspected to be
vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is unaware of any effective workaround for this issue.
