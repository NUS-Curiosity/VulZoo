Akamai Technologies Security Advisory 2007-0001


* Akamai ID:         2007-0001
* Date:              2007/04/16
* Product Name:      Download Manager
* Affected Versions: < 2.2.1.0
* Fixed Version:     2.2.1.0
* CVE IDs:           CVE-2007-1891 CVE-2007-1892
* CVSS Base Score:   (AV:R/AC:H/Au:NR/C:C/I:C/A:C/B:N) 8.0

* Product Description:

Akamai Download Manager is a client software application that helps
users download content easily, quickly, and reliably.  It is available
as an ActiveX component or Java applet and provides users the ability
to pause, resume downloading at a later time, and automatically
recover from dropped connections or system crashes.


* Vulnerability Description:

Two security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ActiveX
version of Akamai Download Manager.  For successful exploitation, both
vulnerabilities require the user to visit a malicious URL, triggering
a stack-based buffer overflow that allows the attacker to execute
arbitrary code within the context of the victim.

Vulnerability CVE-2007-1891 affects versions newer than 2.0.4.4 and
older than 2.2.1.0.  Vulnerability CVE-2007-1892 affects all versions
prior to 2.2.1.0.  Both are remediated by installing version 2.2.1.0
and upgrading to this version is recommended.

The Java version of Akamai Download Manager is not affected by either
of these vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities exist only in the Download Manager client
software and do not affect Akamai's services in any way.


* Patch Instructions:

Affected users can upgrade to the latest version of Akamai Download
Manager by visiting the following web page:

http://dlm.tools.akamai.com/tools/upgrade.html

Visiting that page or any other Download Manager enabled page will
prompt the user to install the latest version of the software
automatically.  Akamai has successfully coordinated with each of our
enterprise customers to ensure that all are distributing the patched
version.

To verify the correct version is installed:

 1) In Internet Explorer, choose "Internet Options..." from the
    "Tools" menu.

 2) Under the "General" tab, select "Settings..." from the "Temporary
    Internet files" section.

 3) Select "View Objects..." from the "Temporary Internet files
    folder" section.

 4) Find the item for "DownloadManager Control" and verify that the
    version is "2,2,1,0" or higher.

 * If you wish to uninstall Download Manager, complete this last step:

 5) Find the item for "DownloadManager Control", right-click and
    select "Remove".

 6) When prompted to confirm, choose "Yes".
