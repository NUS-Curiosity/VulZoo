Synopsis
========

The zziplib library contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that could
lead to user-assisted remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

The zziplib library is a lightweight library for extracting data from
files archived in a single zip file.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/zziplib      < 0.13.49                        >= 0.13.49

Description
===========

dmcox dmcox discovered a boundary error in the zzip_open_shared_io()
function from zzip/file.c .

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to run a zziplib function with an
overly long string as an argument which would trigger the buffer
overflow and may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All zziplib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/zziplib-0.13.49"

References
==========
