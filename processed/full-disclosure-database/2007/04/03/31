     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1547

Description:
     Previous versions of the nas package were vulnerable to a number of buffer 
overflows, NULL and invalid pointers, and an int overflow. Foresight Linux is 
not vulnerable to any of these by default, as Foresight does not ship the 
initscript which starts the nas daemon.
