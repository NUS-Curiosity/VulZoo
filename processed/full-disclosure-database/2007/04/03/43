 Vendor X Server fonts.dir File Parsing Integer Overflow Vulnerability

Multiple Vendor X Server fonts.dir File Parsing Integer Overflow
Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.03.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 03, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

The X Window System (or X11) is a graphical windowing system used on
Unix-like systems. It is based on a client/server model. More
information about about The X Window system is available at the
following URL.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in multiple
vendors' implementations of the X Window System font information file
parsing component could allow execution of arbitrary commands with
elevated privileges.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the parsing of the "fonts.dir"
font information file. When the element count on the first line of the
file specifies it contains more than 1,073,741,824 (2 to the power of
30) elements, a potentially exploitable heap overflow condition occurs.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with elevated
privileges.

As the X11 server requires direct access to video hardware, it runs with
elevated privileges. A user compromising an X server would gain those
permissions.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be
able to cause the X server to use a maliciously constructed font. The
X11 server contains multiple methods for a user to define additional
paths to look for fonts. An exploit has been developed using the "-fp"
command line option to the X11 server to pass the location of the
attack to the server. It is also possible to use "xset" command with
the "fp" option to perform an attack on an already running server.

Some distributions allow users to start the X11 server only if they are
logged on at the console, while others will allow any user to start it.

Attempts at exploiting this vulnerability may put the console into an
unusable state. This will not prevent repeated exploitation attempts.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in X.Org
X11R7.1. Older versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

The X.Org Foundation has addressed this vulnerability with source code
patches. More information can be found from their advisory at the
