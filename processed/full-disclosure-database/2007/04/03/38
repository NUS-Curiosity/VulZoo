Synopsis
========

OpenPBS contains unspecified vulnerabilities which may allow for the
remote execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

OpenPBS is the original version of the Portable Batch System. It is a
flexible batch queueing system developed for NASA in the early to
mid-1990s.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /   Vulnerable   /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-cluster/openpbs     <= 2.3.16-r4                  Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

SUSE reported vulnerabilities due to unspecified errors in OpenPBS.

Impact
======

By unspecified attack vectors an attacker might be able execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running openpbs, which
might be the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

OpenPBS has been masked in the Portage tree for replacement by Torque.
All OpenPBS users should unmerge OpenPBS and switch to Torque.

    
    # emerge --ask --unmerge sys-cluster/openpbs
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --verbose sys-cluster/torque
