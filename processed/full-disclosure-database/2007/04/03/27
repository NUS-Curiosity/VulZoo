Description:
     Previous versions of the ImageMagick package were vulnerable to
buffer overflows in the code which parses DCM and XWD files, which could
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code at the permission level of
the user running ImageMagick (usually non-root). The attacker would have
to convince a user to open the file in ImageMagick. While these file
formats are not common, it is possible to disguise the file such that it
appears to be a file of another, more common, type.
