Synopsis
========

Evince improperly handles user-supplied data possibly allowing for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats, including
PostScript.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/evince     < 0.6.1-r3                        >= 0.6.1-r3

Description
===========

Evince includes code from GNU gv that does not properly boundary check
user-supplied data before copying it into process buffers.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PostScript
document with Evince and possibly execute arbitrary code with the
rights of the user running Evince.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Evince users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/evince-0.6.1-r3"
