Synopsis
========

libwpd is vulnerable to several heap overflows and an integer overflow.

Background
==========

libwpd is a library used to convert Wordperfect documents into other
formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/libwpd       < 0.8.9                            >= 0.8.9

Description
===========

libwpd contains heap-based overflows in two functions that convert
WordPerfect document tables. In addition, it contains an integer
overflow in a text-conversion function.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to convert a specially crafted
WordPerfect file, resulting in a crash or possibly the execution of
arbitrary code with the rights of the user running libwpd.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libwpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/libwpd-0.8.9"
