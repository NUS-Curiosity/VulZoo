     https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1212

Description:
     Previous versions of the krb5 package are vulnerable to three attacks that 
can be triggered remotely, one of which is known to provide unauthenticated 
unrestricted shell access to any system running the krb5 telnet daemon. 
Foresight Linux proper is not vulnerable to these attacks, since krb5-server is 
not included in Foresight.
