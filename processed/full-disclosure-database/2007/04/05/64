-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
systems with affected installations of the Kaspersky Anti-Virus Engine.
User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the engine's handling of the ARJ archive
format. The Kaspersky engine copies data from scanned archives into an
unchecked heap-based buffer. This results in heap corruption when a
malformed ARJ archive is processed by an application that utilizes the
engine. This corruption can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

-- Vendor Response:
Kaspersky has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
