Synopsis
========

Aircrack-ng contains a buffer overflow that could lead to the remote
execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

Background
==========

Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can
recover keys once enough data packets have been captured.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-wireless/aircrack-ng      < 0.7-r2                  >= 0.7-r2

Description
===========

Jonathan So reported that the airodump-ng module does not correctly
check the size of 802.11 authentication packets before copying them
into a buffer.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could trigger a stack-based buffer overflow by
sending a specially crafted 802.11 authentication packet to a user
running airodump-ng with the -w (--write) option. This could lead to
the remote execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running airodump-ng, which is typically the root user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Aircrack-ng users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/aircrack-ng-0.7-r2"
