 Download Manager ActiveX Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

Akamai Download Manager ActiveX Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.16.07
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 16, 2007

I. BACKGROUND

Akamai Technologies, Inc's provides distributed computing platform for
global Internet content caching and application delivery. Akamai
Download Manager is a component of Akamai's service. For more
information please visit following websites.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Akamai
Technologies, Inc's Download Manager ActiveX Control could allow an
attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the
targeted user.

The ActiveX control in question has the following identifiers:

  Class: DownloadManager Control
  CLSID: 2AF5BD25-90C5-4EEC-88C5-B44DC2905D8B
  ProgId: MANAGER.DLMCtrl.1.
  File: C:\Windows\Downloaded Program Files\DownloadManagerV2.ocx

The vulnerability specifically exists due to incorrect use of the
GetPrivateProfileSectionW function. The nSize parameter is incorrectly
passed the total number of bytes available, rather than the number of
wide characters available. This leads to an exploitable stack-based
buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the targeted
user.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to
persuade the victim into viewing a malicious web site. This is usually
accomplished by getting the victim into clicking a link in a form of
electronic communication such as e-mail or instant messaging.
Additionally, the victim must either accept and install, or already
have the download manager control on their system.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability within
version 2.2.0.5 of Akamai Technologies Inc's DownloadManagerV2.ocx. All
older versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Setting the kill-bit for this control will prevent it from being loaded
within Internet Explorer. However, doing so will prevent legitimate use
of the control.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

"Affected users can upgrade to the latest version of Akamai Download
Manager by visiting the following web page:

automatically. Akamai has successfully coordinated with each of our
enterprise customers to ensure that all are distributing the patched
version."
