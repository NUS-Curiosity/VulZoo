     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7180

Description:
     Previous versions of the madwifi package were vulnerable to a number of 
Denial-of-Service issues, at least two of which can be exploited to cause a 
system crash (kernel oops). In addition, previous versions could be made to send 
unencrypted information before authentication finishes when using WPA, an 
information leak.
