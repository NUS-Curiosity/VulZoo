Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHProjekt, allowing
for the execution of arbitrary PHP and SQL code, and cross-site
scripting attacks.

Background
==========

PHProjekt is a project management and coordination tool written in PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/phprojekt       < 5.2.1                         >= 5.2.1

Description
===========

Alexios Fakos from n.runs AG has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in
PHProjekt, including the execution of arbitrary SQL commands using
unknown vectors (CVE-2007-1575), the execution of arbitrary PHP code
using an unrestricted file upload (CVE-2007-1639), cross-site request
forgeries using different modules (CVE-2007-1638), and a cross-site
scripting attack using unkown vectors (CVE-2007-1576).

Impact
======

An authenticated user could elevate their privileges by exploiting the
vulnerabilities described above. Note that the magic_quotes_gpc PHP
configuration setting must be set to "off" to exploit these
vulnerabilities.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PHProjekt users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/phprojekt-5.2.1"
