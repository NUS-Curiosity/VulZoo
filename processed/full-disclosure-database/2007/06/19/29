Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox,
Thunderbird, SeaMonkey and XULRunner, some of which may allow
user-assisted arbitrary remote code execution.

Background
==========

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser from the Mozilla Project,
and Mozilla Thunderbird an email client. The SeaMonkey project is a
community effort to deliver production-quality releases of code derived
from the application formerly known as the 'Mozilla Application Suite'.
XULRunner is a Mozilla runtime package that can be used to bootstrap
XUL+XPCOM applications like Firefox and Thunderbird.

Description
===========

Mozilla developers fixed several bugs involving memory corruption
through various vectors (CVE-2007-2867, CVE-2007-2868). Additionally,
several errors leading to crash, memory exhaustion or CPU consumption
were fixed (CVE-2007-1362, CVE-2007-2869). Finally, errors related to
the APOP protocol (CVE-2007-1558), XSS prevention (CVE-2007-2870) and
spoofing prevention (CVE-2007-2871) were fixed.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly leading to
the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It is also
possible for an attacker to spoof the address bar or other browser
elements, obtain sensitive APOP information, or perform cross-site
scripting attacks, leading to the exposure of sensitive information,
like user credentials.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.4"

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.4"

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.4"

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-2.0.0.4"

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.2"

All SeaMonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.2"

All XULRunner users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/xulrunner-1.8.1.4"
