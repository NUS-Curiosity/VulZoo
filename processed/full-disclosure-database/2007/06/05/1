TPTI-07-10: Centennial Software XferWan.exe Stack Overflow Vulnerability
http://dvlabs.tippingpoint.com/advisory/TPTI-07-10
June  4, 2007

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2007-2514

-- Affected Vendor:
Centennial Software

-- Affected Products:
Symantec Discovery 6.5

-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability since April  3, 2007 by Digital Vaccine protection
filter ID 5231. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of software utilizing Centennial Software
XferWan. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists during the parsing of overly long requests to
the XferWAN process. When logging requests, user-supplied data is
copied to the stack resulting in an exploitable buffer overflow
condition. The following disassembly excerpt from the logging function
demonstrates the issue:

    004047A0 mov cl, Filename[eax]
    004047A6 mov [esp+eax+890h+ExistingFileName], cl
    004047AD inc eax
    004047AE test cl, cl
    004047B0 jnz short loc_4047A0

A lack of sanity checking on the size of 'Filename' results in an
exploitable stack-based  buffer overflow vulnerability that can result
in a system compromise running under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Centennial has rectified an issue in the XFERWAN omponent of Centennial
Discovery which could be remotely exploited by malicious people to
compromise a system.

This issue only affects systems running non-secure communications,
which comprise a very small percentage of installations worldwide. 
Customers can find instructions on how to identify if they are
susceptible to the vulnerability and correct, if necessary on the
Centennial Customer Support website.
