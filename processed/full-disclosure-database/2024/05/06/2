Type: CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))
Component: frontend
Report confidence: Confirmed

Internal reference: DOCS-5199
Type: CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor)
Component: office
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite office 8.21
First fixed revision: OX App Suite office 8.22
Discovery date: 2024-01-10
Solution date: 2024-02-09
CVE: CVE-2024-23193
CVSS: 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

Details:
Documentconverter allows access to other user exported PDF files. E-Mails exported as PDF were stored in a cache that did not consider specific session information for the related user account.

Risk:
Users of the same service node could access other users E-Mails in case they were exported as PDF for a brief moment until caches were cleared. Successful exploitation requires good timing and modification of multiple request parameters. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
Please deploy the provided updates and patch releases. The cache for PDF exports now takes user session information into consideration when performing authorization decisions.
