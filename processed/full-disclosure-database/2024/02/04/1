Meng,

This particular problem was fixed in Vim v9.0.1740 
https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/0a0764684591c7c6a5d722b628f11dc96208e853

I have no idea, why this issue is worth a CVE, because if an attacker
can modify your .viminfo file to make Vim crash, he already has the 
possibilities to do much more harm directly. So I don't think this is 
particular useful CVE. I'd also like to dispute this.

Thanks,
Christian
