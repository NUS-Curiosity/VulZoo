Introduction:
Reprise License Manager 15.1 is affected by an incorrect access control vulnerability which allows low level users, such as read-only users, to arbitrarily change the password of an admin and hijack their account.

Vulnerability PoC:

This vulnerability can be demonstrated by modifying the "user" POST parameter at http://HOST:5054/change_password_process with the username of a target user (such as an Admin account).
When executed this will result in the password of the targeted user being changed and the account therefore being compromised.
