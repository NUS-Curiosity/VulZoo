Internal reference: MWB-2315
Type: CWE-284 (Improper Access Control)
Component: backend
Report confidence: Confirmed
Solution status: Fixed by vendor
Last affected revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev51, OX App Suite backend 8.17
First fixed revision: OX App Suite backend 7.10.6-rev52, OX App Suite backend 8.18
Discovery date: 2023-09-21
Solution date: 2023-09-24
Disclosure date: 2023-09-25
CVE: CVE-2023-29051
CVSS: 8.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N)

Details:
User-defined templates can bypass access control. User-defined OXMF templates could be used to access a limited part of the internal OX App Suite Java API. The existing switch to disable the feature by default was not effective in this case.

Risk:
Unauthorized users could discover and modify application state, including objects related to other users and contexts. No publicly available exploits are known.

Solution:
We now make sure that the switch to disable user-generated templates by default works as intended and will remove the feature in future generations of the product.
