Subject: [FD] [CVE-2016-1014,
	CVE-2016-4247] Executable installers are vulnerable^WEVIL (case
	35): Adobe's Flash Player (un)installers

Hi @ll,

the executable installers of Flash Player released 2016-06-15
fixed CVE-2016-1014 in the second attempt, but another vulnerability
remained: they create(d) and use(d) UNSAFE temporary subdirectories
into which they copy/ied themselves and extract(ed) a file "fpb.tmp"
which they load(ed) and execute(d) later with elevated privileges.

An unprivileged user can/could overwrite both files between creation
and execution and gain elevation of privilege.

See <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html> for this type
of well-known and well-documented vulnerability!


stay tuned
Stefan Kanthak
