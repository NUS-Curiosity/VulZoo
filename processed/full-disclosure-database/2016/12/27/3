Subject: [FD] kernel vuln status question - how can I be protected

Dear kernel maintainers, specialists,

Regarding latest kernel vulns, like CVE-2016-8655, there were some
reports how and where ubuntu/debian/redhat distributions fixed the problem.

However, I could not find clear indications about fixes in plain vanilla
kernel sources. No indication on LTS, and of course nothing on the
others. O.K. there is a patch for the particular CVS+kernel version, but
it is rather not evident to people that they must not go and install a
recent 3.16.39 as it is not fixed. I really could not find out details
and exact information no matter how I tried to find on googole. What
about having a channel to get latest information? What about having LTS
not just patches but information feed. Or what about sending out
additional information added to actual security patches how it
should/would/had affect to other versions.

Of course, maybe there is a trivial solution on that, e.g. I did not see
some notes, but I'm afraid I'm right and zillions of admins simply do
not know if they are vulnerable or not.

So is there a plan for 3.16.39 patch? What about 3.2 3.4 and similar?
Should one use the existing af_packet patch? Or from now on we should
trust on vendors (Debian, Redhat or Andorid... ) and it recommended to
avoid bjuilding kernel from scratch now?

b.
