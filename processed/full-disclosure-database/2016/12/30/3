remote arbitrary code execution in the context of the web server user and
remotely compromise the target web application.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker could target common website
components such as contact/feedback forms, registration forms, password
email resets and others that send out emails with the help of a vulnerable
version of the SwiftMailer class.

to the vendor (since 2nd December).
