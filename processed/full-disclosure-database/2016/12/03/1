Subject: [FD] CVE-2013-0019: MSIE 9 CDoc::ExecuteScriptUri use-after-free

Since November I have been releasing details on all vulnerabilities I
found in web-browsers that I had not released before. I will try to
continue to publish all my old vulnerabilities, including those not in
web-browser, as long as I can find some time to do so. If you find this
information useful, you can help me make some time available by donating
bitcoin to 183yyxa9s1s1f7JBp­PHPmz­Q346y91Rx5DX.

This is the twenty-fourth entry in the series. This information is
available in more detail on my blog at
http://blog.skylined.nl/20161202001.html. There you can find a repro
that triggered this issue in addition to the information below.

Today's release is interesting to me personally, as this was the first
bug I sold as a bug bounty hunter after I quit my job at Google to live
off security bug bounties. Unfortunately, this was quite some time ago,
before I had proper tools or incentive to analyze the issues I was
finding, so there aren't many details in this release.

Follow me on http://twitter.com/berendjanwever for daily browser bugs.

MSIE 9 CDoc::ExecuteScriptUri use-after-free
==========================================
(MS13-009, CVE-2013-0019)

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted web-page can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability
in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. I did not investigate this
vulnerability thoroughly, so I cannot speculate on the potential impact
or exploitability.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 9

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially
  crafted web-page. Disabling JavaScript does not prevent an attacker
  from triggering the vulnerable code path.

Description
-----------
It appears I either did not analyze this issue (probably), or misplaced
my analysis (probably not), as I cannot find any details in my archives,
other than a repro and a HTML bug report created by a predecessor to
BugId (https://github.com/SkyLined/BugId).
From the information provided by ZDI in their advisory, and Microsoft in
their bulletin, as well as the bug report, it seems to have been a
use-after-free vulnerability. Unfortunately, that is all the analysis I
can provide.

Time-line
---------
* June 2012: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.
* June 2012: This vulnerability was submitted to ZDI.
* July 2012: This vulnerability was acquired by ZDI.
* September 2012: This vulnerability was disclosed to Microsoft by ZDI.
* February 2013: Microsoft addresses this vulnerability in MS13-009.
* December 2016: Details of this vulnerability are released.

Cheers,
