1. Summary

   VMware ESXi updates address a cross-site scripting issue.

2. Relevant Releases

   VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi)

3. Problem Description

   a. Host Client stored cross-site scripting issue

   The ESXi Host Client contains a vulnerability that may allow for
   stored cross-site scripting (XSS). The issue can be introduced by
   an attacker that has permission to manage virtual machines through
   ESXi Host Client or by tricking the vSphere administrator to import
   a specially crafted VM. The issue may be triggered on the system
   from where ESXi Host Client is used to manage the specially crafted
   VM.

   VMware advises not to import VMs from untrusted sources.

   VMware would like to thank Caleb Watt (@calebwatt15) for reporting
