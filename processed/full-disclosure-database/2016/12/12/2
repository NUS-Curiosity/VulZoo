MSIE 9 IEFRAME CSelectionInteractButtonBehavior::_UpdateButtonLocation
use-after-free
=======================================================================
(MS13-047, CVE-2013-3111)

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted web-page can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability
in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. I did not investigate this
vulnerability thoroughly, so I cannot speculate on the potential impact
or exploitability.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 9
  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially
  crafted web-page. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker
  from triggering the vulnerable code path.

-------
This bug was found back when I had very little knowledge and tools to do
analysis on use-after-free bugs, so I have no details to share. EIP
revealed that this was a use-after-free vulnerability.
