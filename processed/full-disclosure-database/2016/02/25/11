Subject: Re: [FD] Cisco ASA VPN - Zero Day Exploit

According to Cisco it is CVE-2014-2120, which indicates that much like the
code sort of gave away, it is a bad attempt by a 1337 hax0r to push their
crappy 'exploitpack.com' instead of you know, finding anything useful.
Indeed it is a damn XSS with minimal utility.  The crappy code is just the
icing on the cake that only tastes better when you realize he is over a
year late on his '0-Day'.

In fact, his code is so crappy it will pop on any box because he is
searching for his name, which would be returned no matter what, because the
username field gets populated on the password reset page as a hidden
variable.  Furthermore, searching for the name is pointless because it
doesn't determine if the script is actually santized, which it will be on
any patches system (patched WAY before this 'exploit') because if you
actually print the server response, you'll see how they handled the
username to prevent the script from being executed.
