Subject: [FD] Serendipity Security Advisory - XSS Vulnerability -
	CVE-2015-8603

Information
--------------------
Advisory by Netsparker
Name: XSS Vulnerability in Serendipity
Affected Software : Serendipity
Affected Versions: v2.0.2 and possibly below
Vendor Homepage : http://www.s9y.org
Vulnerability Type : Cross-site Scripting
Severity : Important
Status : Fixed
CVE-ID : CVE-2015-8603
Netsparker Advisory Reference : NS-15-024

Description
--------------------
By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can
hijack a logged in user’s session. This means that the malicious
hacker can change the logged in user’s password and invalidate the
session of the victim while the hacker maintains access. As seen from
the XSS example in this article, if a web application is vulnerable to
cross-site scripting and the administrator’s session is hijacked, the
malicious hacker exploiting the vulnerability will have full admin
privileges on that web application.
