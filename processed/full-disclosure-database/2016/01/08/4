Subject: [FD] OpenCart Security Advisory - XSS Vulnerabiltiy - CVE-2015-4671

--------------------
Advisory by Netsparker
Name: XSS Vulnerability in OpenCart
Affected Software : OpenCart
Affected Versions: v2.1.0.1 and possibly below
Vendor Homepage : http://www.opencart.com
Vulnerability Type : Cross-site Scripting
Severity : Important
Status : Fixed
CVE-ID : CVE-2015-4671
Netsparker Advisory Reference : NS-15-023

Description
--------------------
By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability the attacker can hijack
a logged in user’s session. This means that the malicious hacker can change
the logged in user’s password and invalidate the session of the victim
while the hacker maintains access. As seen from the XSS example in this
article, if a web application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting and the
administrator’s session is hijacked, the malicious hacker exploiting the
vulnerability will have full admin privileges on that web application.
