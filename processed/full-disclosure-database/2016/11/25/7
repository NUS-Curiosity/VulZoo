Severity: Medium

GNU wget in version 1.17 and earlier, when used in mirroring/recursive mode,
is affected by a Race Condition vulnerability that might allow remote attackers
to bypass intended wget access list restrictions specified with -A parameter.
This might allow attackers to place malicious/restricted files onto the system.
Depending on the application / download directory, this could potentially lead
to other vulnerabilities such as code execution etc.
