1. Summary

   VMware Workstation and Fusion updates address address critical
   out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability.

2. Relevant Products

   VMware Workstation Pro / Player

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware Workstation and Fusion out-of-bounds memory access

   The drag-and-drop (DnD) function in VMware Workstation and Fusion has
   an out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability. This may allow a guest
   to execute code on the operating system that runs Workstation or
   Fusion.

   Workaround
   On Workstation Pro and Fusion, the issue cannot be exploited if both
   the drag-and-drop function and the copy-and-paste (C&P) function are
   disabled. Refer to the Reference section on documentation how to
   disable these functions. This workaround is not available on
   Workstation Player.

   VMware would like to thank Qinghao Tang and Xinlei Ying from the
   360 Marvel Team and lokihardt, all working with the organizers of
   PwnFest for reporting this issue to us.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
   assigned the identifier CVE-2016-7461 to this issue.

   Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to
   remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
