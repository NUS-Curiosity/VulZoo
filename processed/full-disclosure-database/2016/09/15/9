Subject: Re: [FD] CVE-2016-6662 - MySQL Remote Root Code Execution /
 Privilege Escalation ( 0day )

Well, 'remote root'...  The PoC asks for a working MySQL user name and 
password.

And I don't really get how that account can re-set the logfile location 
without SUPER privileges?

Am I wrong in thinking that this is really "just" a MySQL admin -> root 
privilege escalation? Don't get me wrong, still a very nice exploit, but...
