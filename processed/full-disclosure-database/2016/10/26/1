                   VMware Security Advisory

Advisory ID: VMSA-2016-0017
Severity:    Moderate
Synopsis:    VMware product updates address multiple information
             disclosure issues
Issue date:  2016-10-25
Updated on:  2016-10-25 (Initial Advisory)
CVE number:  CVE-2016-5328, CVE-2016-5329

1. Summary

VMware product updates address information disclosure issues in
VMware Fusion and VMware Tools running on Mac OS X.

2. Relevant Products

    VMware Fusion
    VMware Tools

3. Problem Description

a. VMware Tools Information disclosure issue in Mac OS X Virtual Machines

An information disclosure vulnerability is present in VMware Tools
running on Mac OS X VMs. Successful exploitation of this issue may
allow a privileged local user on a system where System Integrity Protection
(SIP) is enabled, to obtain kernel memory addresses to bypass the kASLR
protection mechanism. SIP is default enabled in the latest versions of Mac
OS X.

There are no known workarounds for this issue.

VMware would like to thank Marco Grassi (@marcograss) of KeenLab
(@keen_lab), Tencent for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
assigned
the identifier CVE-2016-5328 to this issue.

Column 5 of the following table lists the action required to remediate the
vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

   VMware          Product    Running                  Replace with/
   Product         Version    on          Severity     Apply Patch**

   ============    =======    =======     ========     =============
==========
   VMware Tools    9.x,10.x   Window        N/A          not affected
None
   VMware Tools    9.x,10.x   Linux         N/A          not affected

   * VMware Tools 10.1.0 can be downloaded independently and installed to
     resolve this issue.

   ** At the moment, no versions of ESXi and Fusion consume the latest
      version of VMware Tools i.e. 10.1.0. Remediation of this issue on
  ESXi and Fusion requires downloading and installation of VMware Tools
  10.1.0.

b. VMware Fusion Information disclosure

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow a privileged local user
on a system where System Integrity Protection (SIP) is enabled, to obtain
