Subject: [FD] CVE-2016-4803 dotCMS - Email Header Injection

Title: CVE-2016-4803 dotCMS - Email Header Injection
Credit: Elar Lang / https://security.elarlang.eu
Vulnerability: Email Header Injection
Vulnerable version: before 3.5 / 3.3.2
CVE: CVE-2016-4803
Vendor: dotCMS (http://dotcms.com/)


# Description
dotCMS has an email sending functionality at path /dotCMS/sendEmail/
Some parameters are vulnerable to Email Header Injection.


# Preconditions
There is no pre-condition on authentication or on authorization to
access this functionality.

If captcha is required for the web page, then the only precondition
would be captcha. However, captcha is renewed only when you access the
captcha image - in other words, you can load it once and manually set
the correct value. After this step the "captcha effect" is bypassed.


# Proof-of-Concept
Proof-of-Concept is made on dotCMS demo site with dotCMS version 3.2.1
on 7th of December 2015.

## Value for subject (%0D%0A is for \r\n):
subject=subject%0D%0AX-PoC-of-New-Line%3A+True


## Proof-of-Concept POST request:
<code>
