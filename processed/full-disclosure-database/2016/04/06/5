Subject: [FD] Panda Security 2016 Home User Products - Privilege Escalation

* CVE: CVE-2015-7378
* Vendor: Panda Security
* Reported by: Kyriakos Economou
* Date of Release: 05/04/2016
* Affected Products: Multiple
* Affected Version: Panda Security URL Filtering < v4.3.1.9
* Fixed Version: Panda Security URL Filtering v4.3.1.9

Description:
All Panda Security 2016 Home User products for Windows are vulnerable to privilege escalation,  which allows a local attacker to execute code as SYSTEM from any account (Guest included), thus completely compromising the affected host.


Affected Products:

Panda Gold Protection 2016 v16.0.1
Panda Global Protection 2016 v16.0.1
Panda Internet Security 2016 v16.0.1
Panda Antivirus Pro 2016 v16.0.1
Panda Free Antivirus v16.0.1


Impact:

A local attacker can elevate his privileges from any user account and execute code as SYSTEM.


Technical Details:

By default all the aforementioned products install (current version:4.3.0.4), which creates a service named 'panda_url_filtering' that runs as SYSTEM.
The executable modules are by default installed in "C:\ProgramData\Panda Security URL Filtering" directory.
However, the ACLs assigned to the directory itself, and to the rest of the installed files, allow any user to modify those files and/or substitute them with malicious ones.
A local attacker can easily execute code with SYSTEM account privileges by modifying or substituting the main executable  module of this service, 'Panda_URL_Filteringb.exe', which will run at the next reboot of the host.
