November 10, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3789

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Apple

-- Affected Products:
Apple Quicktime

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing rec
chunks within an AVI media file. By modifying specific values within the
data structure a heap corruption condition can be triggered. An attacker
can abuse this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user
running QuickTime.
