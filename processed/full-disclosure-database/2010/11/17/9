-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way QuickTime decompresses video
samples that are encoded with the Sorenson v3 Codec. Upon parsing
malformed video sample data, the application will calculate an index for
decompression and use that to seek into a buffer used for writing. Due
to lack of bounds checking on the index, a pointer can be made to point
outside of the target array. Upon writing of the data a memory
corruption will occur. Successful exploitation can lead to code
execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple states:
Fixed in
Mac OS X 10.6.5: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4435
