ZDI-10-253: Apple QuickTime GIF LZW Decompression Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-253

November 10, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3795

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Apple

-- Affected Products:
Apple Quicktime

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required in that a target must open a malicious media file or visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the application's implementation of the
LZW compression when opening a certain file format. The application will
allocate a buffer for the image and then decompress image data into it.
Due to explicitly trusting the decompressed data, a buffer overflow will
occur.  This can lead to memory corruption and code execution under the
context of the application.


-- Vendor Response:
Apple states:
Fixed in Mac OS X 10.6.5: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4435
