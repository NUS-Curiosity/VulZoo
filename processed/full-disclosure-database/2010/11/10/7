4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Microsoft Office, 
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's 
system.

The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation when parsing an
Office Art Drawing record, which contains "msofbtSp" records that 
specify certain flags. This can be exploited to corrupt memory via a 
specially crafted Office file.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.
