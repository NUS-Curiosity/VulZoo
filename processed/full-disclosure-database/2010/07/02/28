Package        : mahara
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2010-1667 CVE-2010-1668 CVE-2010-1670 CVE-2010-2479

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in mahara, an electronic portfolio,
weblog, and resume builder. The following Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project ids identify them:

CVE-2010-1667

    Multiple pages performed insufficient input sanitising, making them
    vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.

CVE-2010-1668

    Multiple forms lacked protection against cross-site request forgery
    attacks, therefore making them vulnerable.

CVE-2010-1670

    Gregor Anzelj discovered that it was possible to accidentally
    configure an installation of mahara that allows access to another
    user's account without a password.

CVE-2010-2479

    Certain Internet Explorer-specific cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities were discovered in HTML Purifier, of which a copy
    is included in the mahara package.

For the stable distribution (lenny), the problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny6.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), the problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), the problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.5.


We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.
