<cite>"At the moment there's no available patch so it's recommended
some type of mitigation and to be careful with the visited
links"....</cite>

The fix seems to be here:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/commit/?id=11d65e8a1f1f14e56148fd991965424d9bd1cdbc
(http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/275247)

I wonder if this was in any way inspired by my previous bugreport in
June (the same piece of code, slightly different attack vector).

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-2497
http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?30083

Maybe, maybe not..
