-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the module responsible for handling the
FLV file format. While parsing the HX_FLV_META_AMF_TYPE_MIXEDARRAY and
the HX_FLV_META_AMF_TYPE_ARRAY data types the ParseKnownType function
makes two improper calculations that can force integers to wrap. A
remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary
code under the context of the user playing the file.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
