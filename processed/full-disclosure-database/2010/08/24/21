-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the application's support for 3D
objects. While parsing the 0xFFFFFF45 RIFF record type, the process
performs arithmetic on a size value and uses the result for a heap-based
allocation. By specifying a large enough value an attacker can force the
integer to wrap and thus the process will under-allocate the buffer.
This memory is later copied into using a different size value which
results in object corruption that can be leveraged to execute arbitrary
code under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
