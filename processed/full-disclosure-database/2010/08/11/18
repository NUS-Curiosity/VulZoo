Details
=======

The Cisco ACE 4710 Application Control Engine appliance and the Cisco
ACE Application Control Engine Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series
Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers are a load-balancing and
application-delivery solution for data centers. Multiple
vulnerabilities exist in both products. These vulnerabilities are
independent of each other. A device may be affected by one
vulnerability and not affected by another. The following information
provides the details about each of the vulnerabilities that are
addressed in this advisory.

RTSP Inspection DoS Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RTSP is used by RealAudio, RealNetworks, Apple QuickTime 4,
RealPlayer, and Cisco IP/TV connections. RTSP applications use the
well-known port 554 with TCP and UDP as the control channel. The
module and the appliance only support RTSP over TCP.

The Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Module and Cisco ACE 4710
Application Control Engine contain a DoS vulnerability that can be
exploited by an unauthenticated attacker while sending crafted RTSP
packets. Only devices with RTSP inspection enabled are affected. RTSP
inspection is disabled by default.

Note: A TCP three-way handshake is needed in order to exploit this
vulnerability. Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability;
traffic that is destined to the affected device will not trigger the
vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in these Cisco Bug IDs and has been
assigned these Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) IDs:

  * Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Appliance: CSCta85227 - CVE-2010-2822
  * Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Module: CSCtg14858 - CVE-2010-2822

HTTP, RTSP, and SIP Inspection DoS Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ACE performs a stateful deep packet inspection of the HTTP
protocol. Deep packet inspection is a special case of application
inspection where the ACE examines the application payload of a packet
or a traffic stream and makes decisions based on the content of the
data. During HTTP deep inspection, the main focus of the application
inspection process is on HTTP attributes such as the HTTP header, the
URL, and to a limited extent, the payload. User-defined regular
expressions can also be used to detect "signatures" in the payload.

The Cisco ACE 4710 Application Control Engine contains a DoS
vulnerability that can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker
while sending crafted HTTP packets. Devices with HTTP, RTSP, or SIP
inspection enabled are affected. HTTP, RTSP, and SIP inspection are
disabled by default.

Note: The Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Module is not affected
by this vulnerability. A TCP three-way handshake is needed in order
to exploit this vulnerability. Only transit traffic can trigger this
vulnerability; traffic that is destined to the affected device will
not trigger this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtb54493 and
has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2010-2823.

SSL DoS Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Module contains a DoS
vulnerability that can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker
while sending a series of SSL packets. The Cisco ACE 4710 Application
Control Engine appliance is not affected by this vulnerability.

Note: A TCP three-way handshake is needed in order to exploit this
vulnerability. Only traffic that is destined to the affected device
can trigger this vulnerability; transit traffic will not trigger this
vulnerability.

Note: The Cisco ACE 4710 Application Control Engine appliance is not
affected by this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCta20756 and has
been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2010-2824.

SIP Inspection DoS Vulnerability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SIP is used for call handling sessions, especially two-party
conferences. The Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Module and
Cisco ACE 4710 Application Control Engine contain a DoS vulnerability
that can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker while sending
crafted SIP packets. Only devices with SIP inspection enabled are
affected. SIP inspection is disabled by default.

Note: TCP or UDP SIP packets may cause a device reload. If TCP is
used, a TCP three-way handshake is needed in order to exploit this
vulnerability. Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability;
traffic that is destined to the affected device will not trigger this
vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in these Cisco Bug IDs and has been
assigned these CVE IDs:

  * Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Module: CSCta65603 - CVE-2010-2825
  * Cisco ACE Application Control Engine Appliance: CSCta71569 - CVE-2010-2825
