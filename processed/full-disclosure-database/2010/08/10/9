-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the iccvid.dll module responsible for
compression and decompression of VIDC (Cinepak) streams. The code within
CVDecompress allocates a static amount of space for storing an RGB
palette. By modifying a VIDC compressed stream within an AVI file, an
attacker can force code within iccvid to loop excessively, each time
incrementing the pointer for the palette storage. By abusing this
behavior an attacker can execute arbitrary code under the context of the
user invoking the application that uses this codec.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
