-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Flash Player

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

triggered. This can be exploited by remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the user running the web browser.
