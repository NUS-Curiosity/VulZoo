Trustwave's SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2010-002
Web Service Hijacking in VMWare WebAccess

https://www.trustwave.com/spiderlabs/advisories/TWSL2010-002.txt

Published: 2010-03-30 Version: 1.0

Vendor: VMware, Inc (http://www.vmware.com)
Product: VMWare VirtualCenter, VMWare ESX
Versions affected: VirtualCenter 2.5, 2.0.x, ESX 3.5, ESX 3.0.x

Product description: 
VMWare Infrastructure is a virtualized environment that 
allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single 
physical server. Management can be performed via a 
Struts-based web application, or via a thick client. Both 
the web interface and the thick client effect all changes 
through SOAP calls to an XML web service.

CVE: CVE-2009-2277

Finding:
The Struts-based web application uses the server-side session 
attribute "context_vmdirect" to store various settings, 
including the URL to the XML web service backend. By default, 
the URL is http://localhost/sdk, but the web service URL can be 
manually set from a client browser in several locations. One 
location is /ui/vmDirect.do, by passing a base64-encoded value 
to in the "view" parameter as shown below:

/ui/vmDirect.do?view=d3NVcmw9aHR0cDovL2xvY2FsaG9zdC9zZGsmdm1JZD1WaXJ0dWFsTWFjaGluZXwxMjgmdWk9OQ==_

Decoded, the view value is: 

wsUrl=http://localhost/sdk&vmId=VirtualMachine|128&ui=9

If wsUrl is changed to point at an external server, all SOAP 
calls for that session are sent to the specified server. This 
includes plaintext authentication credentials.

An attacker could exploit this by tricking a user into following 
a link to /ui/vmDirect.do, with an attacker-controlled server 
passed in the "view" parameter. Because the "context_vmdirect" 
session attribute can be set pre-authentication, and because a 
logged-out session can be reused with different credentials, an 
attacker could leave a shared browser with a session pointing at 
a malicious web service.	

Because the authentication credentials used by the management 
tools are based on the underlying Linux user accounts, this 
attack could lead to a full compromise of the host server.

the vulnerability (column 4) if a solution is available.
