References:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4565

Description:
    Previous versions of sendmail do not properly handle a '\0' character in a 
    Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which could allow attackers 
    to spoof arbitrary SSL-based SMTP servers or bypass intended access 
    restrictions via a crafted server certificate issued by a legitimate 
    Certification Authority.
