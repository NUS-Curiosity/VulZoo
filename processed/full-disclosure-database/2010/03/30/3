4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in ViewVC, which can
be exploited by malicious people to conduct cross-site scripting
attacks.

Input passed to the regular expression search functionality is not
properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be
exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's
browser session in context of an affected site.

Successful exploitation requires that the regular expression search
functionality is enabled (disabled by default).

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 1.0.11 or 1.1.5.
