Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 March 24 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IOS Software is affected by a denial of service vulnerability
that may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause an affected
device to reload or hang. The vulnerability may be triggered by a TCP
segment containing crafted TCP options that is received during the
TCP session establishment phase. In addition to specific, crafted TCP
options, the device must have a special configuration to be affected
by this vulnerability.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Vulnerable devices are running an affected version of Cisco IOS
Software, and are configured for any of the following:

  * A specific TCP window size
  * TCP path MTU discovery (PMTUD)
  * Stateful Network Address Translation (SNAT) with TCP as the
    transport protocol

Configurations Using a Specific TCP Window Size
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devices configured to use a specific TCP receive window size for
connections originating on the device are affected by this
vulnerability. A device configured with a specific TCP receive window
size has the following command in its configuration:

    ip tcp window-size <window size, from 0 to 1073741823>

If the TCP window size has not been explicitly configured with the
command "ip tcp window-size <window size, from 0 to 1073741823>" then
the device is not affected by the vulnerability.

Configurations Using Path MTU Discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devices configured to use PMTUD for TCP connections originating or
terminating on the device are also affected by this vulnerability.
Different Cisco IOS Software features may allow to enable or disable
PMTUD on a per-feature basis. The following list contains features
known to enable PMTUD for TCP connections:

  * TCP over IPv4: the "ip tcp path-mtu-discovery" command enables
    PMTUD for all new TCP over IPv4 connections from the device. This
    command is disabled by default.
  * TCP over IPv6: PMTUD is enabled by default for IPV6 and cannot be
    disabled.
  * Border Gateway Protocol (BGP): recent versions of Cisco IOS
    Software (Cisco IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA, 12.2(31)SB, 12.2(33)SXH,
    12.4(20)T and later releases) automatically enable PMTUD for all
    BGP neighbor sessions when BGP is configured. Refer to:
    
    http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2sr/12_2sra/feature/guide/srbgpmtu.html
    
    for details.

Other features like generic routing encapsulation (GRE), IP-in-IP
tunneling, and Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) also allow the use
of PMTUD. However, these are not related to TCP services and
therefore are not affected by this vulnerability.

Configurations Using Stateful NAT with TCP as the Transport Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devices configured to use SNAT are also affected by this
vulnerability. A device configured to use SNAT with TCP as the
transport protocol has the following commands in its configuration:

    ip nat Stateful id <stateful NAT ID number>
         redundancy <redundancy group name>
             ...
             protocol   tcp
    !

Note that to be affected under an SNAT configuration scenario, the
SNAT transport protocol must be TCP. Recent versions of Cisco IOS
Software do not support the use of TCP as the SNAT transport protocol
(they only support UDP), in which case the use of SNAT does not make
a device vulnerable. SNAT is not enabled by default, and when SNAT is
configured, the default transport protocol is TCP if the Cisco IOS
Software release supports TCP as a transport protocol for SNAT.

Determining The Cisco IOS Software Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the 
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name is displayed in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router#show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:

    Router#show version
    Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected.

Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco IOS Software is affected by a denial of service vulnerability
that may allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to cause a device
reload or hang.

The vulnerability may only be triggered by a TCP segment received
during the TCP session establishment phase. The received TCP segment
must contain crafted, not malformed, TCP options. A TCP three-way
handshake does not need to be completed to exploit the vulnerability.

To be affected by this vulnerability, a device must be configured for
any of the following:

  * A specific TCP receive window size
  * PMTUD
  * SNAT with TCP as the transport protocol

Refer to the Affected Products section for additional details on
these configurations.

The vulnerability exists in the TCP options processing code of Cisco
IOS Software. When the vulnerability is triggered, Cisco IOS Software
enters an infinite loop that may cause the device to reload or hang.
The following syslog messages may indicate that this vulnerability
has been exploited:

    %SYS-3-CPUHOG: Task is running for (128004)msecs, more than (2000)msecs (23/1),process = IP Input.
    -Traceback= 0x41CA6AC4 0x41C83170 0x41A22704 0x41F249D4 0x41A24A34 0x41B24C58 
    %SYS-2-WATCHDOG: Process aborted on watchdog timeout, process = IP Input.

This vulnerability is addressed by Cisco bug ID CSCsz75186 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2010-0577.

BGP Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This vulnerability could be exploited through the BGP port (TCP port
179) if all the following conditions are met:

  * The device is configured for one or more of the features that
    make a device affected, as explained above. Note that in recent
    versions of Cisco IOS Software, configuring BGP automatically
    enables PMTUD for all BGP neighbor sessions.
  * The source IP address of an attack packet is the IP address of a
    configured BGP peer.
  * If the BGP TTL Security Hack (BTSH)/Generalized TTL Security
    Mechanism (GTSM) is configured, the TTL of the received attack
    packet is within the allowed TTL range.
  * If the BGP peering session is protected by the TCP MD5 option,
    the attack packet has the correct MD5 hash.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than
disabling the specific features that make a device vulnerable, if
feasible.

Additionally, allowing only legitimate devices to connect to affected
devices will help limit exposure to this vulnerability. Refer to the 
Control Plane Policing and Configuring Infrastructure Access Lists
(iACLs) subsections below for further details. Since a TCP three-way
handshake is not required, to increase effectiveness, the mitigation
must be coupled with anti-spoofing measures on the network edge.

Specific mitigations for BGP are discussed below in the BGP
Considerations subsection.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the companion document "Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the
Cisco IOS Software Crafted TCP Packet Denial of Service
Vulnerability", which is available at the following location:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100324-tcp.shtml

Configurations Using a Specific TCP Window Size
+----------------------------------------------

Not setting a specific TCP receive window size can be accomplished by
removing the "ip tcp window-size" command from the configuration.

Configurations Using Path MTU Discovery
+--------------------------------------

PMTUD may be disabled in some of the Cisco IOS Software features that
make use of PMTUD. The specific command to use to disable PMTUD
varies depending on the specific feature:

  * TCP over IPv4: removing the "ip tcp path-mtu-discovery" command
    from the configuration will disable PMTUD for TCP over IPv4
    sessions that originate on the device.
  * TCP over IPv6: PMTUD is enabled by default for IPV6 and cannot be
    disabled.
  * BGP: if BGP is configured on a recent version of Cisco IOS
    Software that enables PMTUD for BGP sessions, PMTUD can be
    disabled for all BGP sessions with the "no bgp transport
    path-mtu-discovery" command in router configuration mode (Cisco
    IOS Release 12.2(33)SRA, 12.2(31)SB, 12.2(33)SXH, 12.4(20)T, and
    later releases).

Configurations Using Stateful NAT with TCP as the Transport Protocol
+-------------------------------------------------------------------

SNAT can be disabled by removing the "ip nat Stateful id" command from
the configuration.

Control Plane Policing
+---------------------

For devices that need to offer TCP services, it is possible to use
Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to block TCP traffic to the device from
untrusted sources. Cisco IOS Releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T,
12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP may be configured on a
device to protect the management and control planes to minimize the
risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly
permitting only authorized traffic sent to infrastructure devices in
accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The
following example can be adapted to specific network configurations:
    
    !-- The 192.168.1.0/24 network and the 172.16.1.1 host are trusted.
    !-- Everything else is not trusted. The following access list is used
    !-- to determine what traffic needs to be dropped by a control plane
    !-- policy (the CoPP feature.) If the access list matches (permit)
    !-- then traffic will be dropped and if the access list does not
    !-- match (deny) then traffic will be processed by the router.
    !-- Note that TCP ports 22 and 23 are just examples; this configuration
    !-- needs to be expanded to include all used TCP ports.
    
    access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 22
    access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 23
    access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 22
    access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 23
    access-list 100 permit tcp any any
    
    !-- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4
    !-- traffic in accordance with existing security policies and
    !-- configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent
    !-- to infrastructure devices.
    !-- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by
    !-- the CoPP feature.
    
    class-map match-all drop-tcp-class
      match access-group 100
    
    !-- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the
    !-- Control-Plane of the device, and add the "drop-tcp-traffic"
    !-- class map.
    
    policy-map control-plane-policy
     class drop-tcp-class
      drop
    
    !-- Apply the Policy-Map to the Control-Plane of the
    !-- device.
    
    control-plane
     service-policy input control-plane-policy

Warning: Because a TCP three-way handshake is not required to
exploit this vulnerability, it is possible to easily spoof the IP
address of the sender, which may defeat access control lists (ACLs)
that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses.

In the above CoPP example, the access control entries (ACEs) that
match the potential exploit packets with the "permit" action result
in these packets being discarded by the policy-map "drop" function,
while packets that match the "deny" action (not shown) are not
affected by the policy-map drop function. Additional information on
the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/coppwp_gs.html

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gtrtlimt.html

Configuring Infrastructure Access Lists (iACLs)
+----------------------------------------------

Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your
network, it is possible to identify traffic that should never be
allowed to target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic
at the border of your network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a
network security best practice and should be considered as a
long-term addition to good network security as well as a workaround
for this specific vulnerability. The white paper entitled "Protecting
Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists" presents
guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for infrastructure
protection ACLs:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml

BGP Considerations
+-----------------

BTSH/GTSM can help prevent exploitation of this vulnerability via the
BGP port because packets coming from devices that do not pass the TTL
check configured via BTSH are dropped before any TCP processing takes
place. For information on BTSH refer to:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t7/feature/guide/gt_btsh.html

MD5 authentication for BGP peering sessions can also help prevent
exploitation via the BGP port because the MD5 hash in an attack
packet is checked before processing the crafted TCP option. For a
detailed discussion on how to configure BGP, refer to the following
document:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_0/np1/configuration/guide/1cbgp.html
