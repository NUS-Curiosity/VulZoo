Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express
Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100324-cucme

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 March 24 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Devices running Cisco IOS Software and configured for Cisco Unified
Communications Manager Express (CME) or Cisco Unified Survivable
Remote Site Telephony (SRST) operation are affected by two denial of
service vulnerabilities that may result in a device reload if
successfully exploited. The vulnerabilities are triggered when the
Cisco IOS device processes specific, malformed Skinny Call Control
Protocol (SCCP) messages.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100324-cucme.shtml

Note: The March 24, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes seven Security Advisories. All the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each
advisory lists the releases that correct the vulnerability or
vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table at the following
URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software
vulnerabilities that have been published on March 24, 2010, or
earlier:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100324-bundle.shtml

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual
Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the

Affected Products
=================

Cisco IOS devices, including Cisco Unified Communications 500 Series,
that are configured for the Cisco Unified CME or the Cisco Unified
SRST features are affected.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

A Cisco IOS device that is configured for Cisco Unified CME operation
displays the following output when the "show running-config" command is
issued:

    telephony-service
      ...
    !
    ephone <Ethernet phone tag>
      ...

A Cisco IOS device that is configured for Cisco Unified SRST
operation displays the following output when the "show running-config"
command is issued:

    call-manager-fallback
      ...

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the 
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name is displayed in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router#show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of
C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:

    Router#show version
    Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected.

Cisco IOS XE Software is not affected.

Cisco Unified Communications Manager is not affected.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified CME is the call processing component of an enhanced IP
telephony solution that is integrated into Cisco IOS Software. Cisco
Unified SRST is a critical component of a centralized call-processing
architecture in which a Cisco Unified Communications Manager cluster,
located at a central site, provides telephony services for all sites
of an organization.

The Cisco Unified CME and Cisco Unified SRST features in Cisco IOS
Software are affected by two denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities
that may cause a device reload when processing specific, malformed
SCCP messages. The malformed SCCP messages can only come from
registered phone IP addresses. If the auto-registration feature is
enabled (Cisco Unified CME only), an attacker can register its IP
address and subsequently send a malformed payload to exploit these
vulnerabilities. The auto-registration feature is enabled by default.
More information on auto-registration can be found at the following
link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucme/command/reference/cme_a1ht.html#wp1031242

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that a TCP three-way
handshake to the SCCP port be completed. By default, the SCCP port is
TCP port 2000, but this can be changed with the "ip source-address"
command in telephony service configuration mode.

These vulnerabilities are addressed by Cisco bug IDs CSCsz48614 and
CSCsz49741 and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) IDs CVE-2010-0585 and CVE-2010-0586, respectively.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerabilities in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss


CSCsz48614 and CSCsz49741

CVSS Base Score - 7.8

Access Vector           - Network

Remediation Level       - Official-Fix
Report Confidence       - Confirmed


Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities in this advisory may
result in a reload of the affected device. Repeated exploitation
could result in a sustained denial of service condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
release train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the
earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the
anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed
in the "First Fixed Release for this Advisory" column of the table.
The "First Fixed Release for all Advisories in 24 March 2010 Bundle
Publication" column indicates the earliest possible releases which
have fixes for all the published vulnerabilities in this Cisco IOS
Security Advisory bundled publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to
the latest available release where possible.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities. However, in the
case of the Cisco Unified CME feature, auto-registration can be
disabled to make exploitation more difficult. Auto-registration can
be disabled for the Cisco Unified CME feature by issuing the
following commands:

    telephony-service
      no auto-reg-ephone

Before disabling auto-registration, all phone MAC addresses need to
be explicitly defined on the Cisco Unified CME. Otherwise phones will
not be able to register. More information on auto-registration can be
found at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucme/command/reference/cme_a1ht.html#wp1031242

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the companion document "Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the
Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express and Cisco IOS Software
H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service
Vulnerabilities", which is available at the following location:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100324-voice.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.

Refer to:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html

for additional TAC contact information, including localized telephone
numbers, and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various
languages.
