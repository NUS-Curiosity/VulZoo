Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Multiprotocol Label
Switching Packet Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100324-ldp

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 March 24 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A device running Cisco IOSï¿½ Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or Cisco
IOS XR Software is vulnerable to a remote denial of service (DoS)
condition if it is configured for Multiprotocol Label Switching
(MPLS) and has support for Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).

A crafted LDP UDP packet can cause an affected device running Cisco
IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software to reload. On devices running
affected versions of Cisco IOS XR Software, such packets can cause
the device to restart the mpls_ldp process.

A system is vulnerable if configured with either LDP or Tag
Distribution Protocol (TDP).

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.

Affected Products
=================

Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, and Cisco IOS XR Software
devices are vulnerable if they are configured to listen for either
targeted LDP hello messages or link LDP hello messages.

All versions of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software that
support MPLS are affected. Cisco IOS XR Software is affected in
releases prior to 3.5.2.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Several features within Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software,
and Cisco IOS XR Software require the device to listen for either
targeted LDP hello messages or link LDP hello messages. The most
reliable way to determine if the device is configured to listen to
LDP hello messages, is to log into the device and perform these
actions:

 1. Confirm whether MPLS forwarding is enabled.
 
    A device that has MPLS forwarding disabled, is not vulnerable.
   
    Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    MPLS forwarding is enabled by default in Cisco IOS Software and
    Cisco IOS XE Software via the CLI command "mpls ip". A device that
    has MPLS forwarding disabled, will have the global configuration
    command "no mpls ip" in the configuration. For Cisco IOS Software,
    the output of "show mpls interface" will show whether the device
    has it disabled. This example shows a Cisco IOS Software device
    that has MPLS forwarding disabled:
   
        Router#show mpls interface
        IP MPLS forwarding is globally disabled on this router.
        Individual interface configuration is as follows:
        
        Interface              IP            Tunnel   Operational
        Router#
   
    For Cisco IOS XE Software, examine the output of show
    running-config and confirm the existence of the global command
    "no mpls ip | include mpls", to ensure that the device will not
    process LDP hello messages. This example shows a Cisco IOS XE
    Software device that has MPLS forwarding disabled:
   
        Router#show running-config | include mpls
        no mpls ip
        Router#
   
    Cisco IOS XR Software
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
    MPLS forwarding is disabled by default in Cisco IOS XR Software.
   
    A device that has MPLS forwarding enabled, will have the global
    configuration command "mpls ldp" in the configuration. This example
    shows a Cisco IOS XR Software device that has MPLS forwarding
    enabled:
   
        RP/0/0/CPU0:Router-XR#show running-config mpls
        mpls ldp
        !
        
        RP/0/0/CPU0:Router-XR#
   
    This example shows a Cisco IOS XR Software device with MPLS
    forwarding disabled:
   
        RP/0/0/CPU0:Router-XR#show running-config mpls
        % No such configuration item(s)
        
        RP/0/0/CPU0:Router-XR#
   
    If MPLS is disabled the device is not vulnerable and there is no
    requirement to perform the next step.
   
 2. Confirm whether the device is listening to LDP hello messages.
 
    If a device is configured to listen to LDP hello messages, it is
    vulnerable.
   
    Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
    To determine if a device is configured to listen for LDP hello
    messages, log into the device and issue either of the following
    command line interface (CLI) commands "show ip socket", "show udp" or
    "show control-plane host open-ports". If the output shows any IP
    addresses listening on port UDP 646, the device is vulnerable.
    This is an example of a device that is configured to listen for
    LDP hello messages (one example is shown from each of the above
    commands):
   
        Router#show ip socket
        Proto    Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out Stat TTY OutputIF
         17   --listen--          192.168.0.1        67   0   0    1   0
         17   --listen--          192.168.0.1        68   0   0    1   0
         17   --listen--          192.168.0.1       711   0   0    1   0
         17   --listen--          192.168.0.1       646   0   0    1   0
         17   --listen--          192.168.0.1      3503   0   0    1   0
        Router#
   
        Router#show udp
        Proto    Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out Stat TTY OutputIF
         17   --listen--          192.168.0.1       123   0   0    1   0
         17   --listen--          192.168.0.1       711   0   0    1   0
         17   --listen--          192.168.0.1       646   0   0    1   0
         17   --listen--          192.168.0.1      3503   0   0    1   0
        Router#
   
        Router#show control-plane host open-ports
        Active internet connections (servers and established)
        Prot        Local Address      Foreign Address                  Service    State
         tcp                 *:23                  *:0                   Telnet   LISTEN
         udp                *:123                  *:0                      NTP   LISTEN
         udp                *:646                  *:0                LDP Hello   LISTEN
         udp                *:711                  *:0                TDP Hello   LISTEN
        
        Router#
   
    Cisco IOS XR Software
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   
    To determine if a device is configured to listen for LDP hello
    messages, log in to the device and issue the "show udp brief" CLI
    command. If the output shows any IP address listening on port UDP
    646, the device is vulnerable. This is an example of a device
    that is configured to listen for LDP hello messages:
   
        RP/0/0/CPU0:Router-XR#show udp brief
        PCB        Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address
        0x482609e8      0      0  :::514                 :::0
        0x482605f0      0      0  0.0.0.0:514            0.0.0.0:0
        0x48260720      0      0  0.0.0.0:646            0.0.0.0:0
        RP/0/0/CPU0:Router-XR#
   
    If the device is not listening on UDP port 646, it is not
    vulnerable. Devices that are configured to only use Resource
    Reservation Protocol (RSVP) or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to
    distribute labels or MPLS Static Labels are not vulnerable.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the 
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may provide
different output.

This example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS
Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of C2500-IS-L:

    Router#show version
     Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
     IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

This example shows a product that is running Cisco IOS Software
release 12.4(20)T with an image name of C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:

    Router#show version

Details
=======

MPLS LDP enables peer label switch routers (LSRs) in an MPLS network
to exchange label binding information for supporting hop-by-hop
forwarding in an MPLS network.

A vulnerability exists in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software,
and Cisco IOS XR Software when processing a specially crafted LDP
packet. For the device to be vulnerable, it has to be configured to
process LDP hello messages, as explained within the Affected Products
section of this advisory.

The crafted LDP packet, can be received as either a unicast or
multicast UDP packet on port UDP 646 on any listening IP address of
the device. Transit traffic will not trigger this vulnerability.

Note: Devices configured with TDP will also process the crafted LDP
packet and are vulnerable.

For further information regarding MPLS and LDP please consult the
"Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Introduction" home page
available at this link:

Workarounds
===========

Users are advised to apply mitigation techniques to help limit
exposure to the vulnerability. Mitigation consists of allowing only
legitimate devices to connect to the device. To increase
effectiveness, the mitigation must be coupled with anti-spoofing
measures on the network edge. This action is required because LDP
will use UDP as the hello transport protocol.

If LDP is not required on the device, then MPLS forwarding can be
disabled with the global configuration command "no mpls ip".

Note:  LDP password or MD5 protection, does not protect against this
vulnerability.

Transit traffic will not exploit this vulnerability. Only packets
destined to the device may be used to exploit this vulnerability.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the companion document "Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the
Cisco IOS Software Multiprotocol Label Switching Packet
Vulnerability," which is available at this location:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100324-ldp.shtml

Infrastructure Access Control Lists
+----------------------------------

Warning:  Because the feature in this vulnerability utilizes
UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address,
which may defeat access control lists (ACLs) that permit
communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. Unicast
Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF) should also be considered, to
offer a comprehensive solution.

Although it is often difficult to block traffic that transits a
network, it is possible to identify traffic that should never be
allowed to target infrastructure devices and block that traffic at
the border of the network. Infrastructure ACLs (iACLs) are a network
security best practice and should be considered as a long-term
addition to good network security as well as a workaround for this
specific vulnerability. The iACL example below should be included as
part of the deployed infrastructure access list, which will help
protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP
address range:
    
    !---
    !--- Feature: Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
    !---
    
    access-list 150 permit udp TRUSTED_SOURCE_ADDRESSES 
        WILDCARD INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD eq 646
    
    access-list 150 permit udp TRUSTED_SOURCE_ADDRESSES 
        WILDCARD host 224.0.0.2 eq 646
    
    !---
    !--- Deny LDP traffic from all other sources destined
    !--- to infrastructure addresses.
    !---
    
    access-list 150 deny udp any 
        INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD eq 646
    
    !---
    !--- Permit/deny all other Layer 3 and Layer 4 traffic in
    !--- accordance with existing security policies and
    !--- configurations.  Permit all other traffic to transit the
    !--- device.
    !---
    
    access-list 150 permit ip any any
    
    !---
    !--- Apply access-list to all interfaces (only one example
    !--- shown)
    !---
    
    interface fastEthernet 2/0
     ip access-group 150 in

The white paper entitled "Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure
Protection Access Control Lists" presents guidelines and recommended
deployment techniques for infrastructure protection access lists and
is available at this link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml

Control Plane Policing
+---------------------

Warning: Because the feature in this vulnerability utilizes
UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address,
which may defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from
trusted IP addresses. Unicast RPF should also be considered, to offer
a comprehensive solution.

Control Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block untrusted UDP
traffic to the device. Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.0S, 12.2SX,
12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP can be
configured on a device to help protect the management and control
planes and minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct
infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized
traffic that is sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with
existing security policies and configurations. The CoPP example below
should be included as part of the deployed CoPP policy, which will
help protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP
address range.
    
    !---
    !--- Feature: Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
    !---    
    
    access-list 150 deny udp TRUSTED_SOURCE_ADDRESSES 
         WILDCARD any eq 646    
    
    !---
    !--- Deny LDP traffic from all other sources destined
    !--- to the device control plane.
    !---    
    
    access-list 150 permit udp any any eq 646    
    
    !---
    !--- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and 
    !--- Layer4 traffic in accordance with existing security policies
    !--- and configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent
    !--- to infrastructure devices
    !--- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by
    !--- the CoPP feature
    !---   
    
    class-map match-all drop-ldp-class
     match access-group 150   
    
    !---
    !--- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the
    !--- Control-Plane of the device.
    !---    
    
    policy-map control-plane-policy
     class drop-ldp-class
      drop
    
    !---
    !--- Apply the Policy-Map to the 
    !--- Control-Plane of the device
    !---
    
    control-plane
     service-policy input control-plane-policy

In the above CoPP example, the access control entries (ACEs) that
match the potential exploit packets with the "permit" action result
in these packets being discarded by the policy-map "drop" function,
while packets that match the "deny" action (not shown) are not
affected by the policy-map drop function. Please note that the
policy-map syntax is different in the 12.2S and 12.0S Cisco IOS
Software trains:

    policy-map control-plane-policy
    class drop-udp-class
    police 32000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action drop

Additional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP
feature can be found in the documents, "Control Plane Policing
Implementation Best Practices" and "Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.2
S - Control Plane Policing" at these links:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/coppwp_gs.html

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gtrtlimt.html

Receive ACLs (rACL)
+------------------

Warning: Because the feature in this vulnerability utilizes UDP as a
transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may
defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP
addresses. Unicast RPF should also be considered, to offer a
comprehensive solution.

For distributed platforms, Receive ACLs may be an option starting in
Cisco IOS Software Versions 12.0(21)S2 for the 12000 (GSR), 12.0(24)S
for the 7500, and 12.0(31)S for the 10720. The Receive ACL protects
the device from harmful traffic before the traffic can impact the
route processor. Receive ACLs are designed to only protect the device
on which it is configured. On the 12000, 7500, and 10720, transit
traffic is never affected by a receive ACL. Because of this, the
destination IP address "any" used in the example ACL entries below
only refer to the router's own physical or virtual IP addresses.
Receive ACLs are considered a network security best practice, and
should be considered as a long-term addition to good network
security, as well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability.
The white paper entitled "GSR: Receive Access Control Lists" will
help you identify and allow legitimate traffic to your device and
deny all unwanted packets. This white paper is available at the
following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml

The following is the receive path ACL written to permit this type of
traffic from trusted hosts:

    !---
    !--- Feature: Label Distribution Protocol (LDP)
    !---    
    
    !---
    !--- Permit LDP traffic from all trusted sources allowed
    !--- to infrastructure addresses.
    !---
    
    access-list 150 permit udp TRUSTED_SOURCE_ADDRESSES WILDCARD
         any eq 646
    
    !---
    !--- Deny LDP traffic from all other sources destined
    !--- to infrastructure addresses.
    !---
    
    access-list 150 deny udp any any eq 646
    
    !---
    !--- Permit all other traffic to the RP.
    !--- according to security policy and configurations.
    !---
    
    access-list 150 permit ip any any
    
    !---
    !--- Apply this access list to the 'receive' path.
    !---
    
    ip receive access-list 150
