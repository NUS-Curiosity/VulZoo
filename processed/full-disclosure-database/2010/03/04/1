Subject: fcrontab Information Disclosure Vulnerability

============================================
 fcrontab Information Disclosure Vulnerability
 March 3, 2010
 CVE-2010-0792
============================================

==Description==

fcrontab, part of the fcron scheduler, is vulnerable to several race
conditions that allow a local attacker to use symbolic links to read
unauthorized files.  On systems where fcrontab is installed with its
own "fcron" group, this allows an attacker to read other non-root
users' crontabs and fcron configuration files.  On systems where
fcrontab is installed suid root, this allows an attacker to read arbitrary
files.

==Solution==

The developer has released a new version, 3.0.5, to address these
vulnerabilities.  It is available for download on the developer's
website, http://fcron.free.fr.  Users are advised to recompile from
source or download updated packages from downstream distributors
when they become available.
