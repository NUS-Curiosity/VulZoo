ZDI-10-023: Multiple Vendor librpc.dll Signedness Error Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-023
March 1, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2009-2754

-- Affected Vendors:
IBM
EMC

-- Affected Products:
IBM Informix
EMC NetWorker

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of both IBM Informix Dynamic Server and EMC
Legato Networker. User interaction is not required to exploit this
vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the RPC protocol parsing library,
librpc.dll, utilized by the ISM Portmapper service (portmap.exe) bound
by default to TCP port 36890. During authentication, a lack of a proper
signedness check on a supplied parameter size can result in exploitable
stack based buffer overflow leading to arbitrary code execution under
the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Responses:
IBM states:
This issue was first fixed in: IDS 10.00.TC9, IDS
11.10.TC3 Recommended fix pack version: IDS 10.00.TC10, IDS 11.10.TC3 4.

exploit code. Instead, upon notifying the affected product vendor,
TippingPoint provides its customers with zero day protection through
its intrusion prevention technology. Explicit details regarding the
specifics of the vulnerability are not exposed to any parties until
an official vendor patch is publicly available. Furthermore, with the
altruistic aim of helping to secure a broader user base, TippingPoint
provides this vulnerability information confidentially to security
vendors (including competitors) who have a vulnerability protection or
mitigation product.
