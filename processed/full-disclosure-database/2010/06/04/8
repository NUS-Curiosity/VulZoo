Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Asterisk might allow remote attackers to
cause a Denial of Service condition, or conduct other attacks.

Background
==========

Asterisk is an open source telephony engine and toolkit.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/asterisk      < 1.2.37                         >= 1.2.37

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Asterisk:

* Nick Baggott reported that Asterisk does not properly process
  overly long ASCII strings in various packets (CVE-2009-2726).

* Noam Rathaus and Blake Cornell reported a flaw in the IAX2 protocol
  implementation (CVE-2009-2346).

* amorsen reported an input processing error in the RTP protocol
  implementation (CVE-2009-4055).

* Patrik Karlsson reported an information disclosure flaw related to
  the REGISTER message (CVE-2009-3727).

* A vulnerability was found in the bundled Prototype JavaScript
  library, related to AJAX calls (CVE-2008-7220).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a
specially crafted package, possibly causing a Denial of Service
condition, or resulting in information disclosure.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/asterisk-1.2.37"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since January 5, 2010. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
