4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Creative Software 
AutoUpdate Engine 2 ActiveX control, which can be exploited by 
malicious people to compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by a boundary error in a callback 
function used when handling the "BrowseFolder()" method. This can be 
exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long 
string argument.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Set the kill-bit for the affected ActiveX control.

The vulnerability is reportedly fixed in an upcoming version 2.0.13.
