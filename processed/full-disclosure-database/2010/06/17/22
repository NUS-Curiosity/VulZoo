FileField 6.x-3.3 Arbitrary Script Injection Vulnerability

CVE-2010-1958

Description of Vulnerability:
- -----------------------------
Drupal (http://drupal.org) is a robust content management system (CMS)
written in PHP and MySQL.  The Drupal FileField module
(http://drupal.org/project/filefield) "provides a universal file upload
field for CCK. It is a robust alternative to core's Upload module and an
absolute must for users uploading a large number of files. Great for
managing video and audio files for podcasts on your own site."  The
FileField module contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due
to the fact that it fails to sanitize image filenames before display.

Systems affected:
- -----------------
Drupal 6.16 with CCK 6.x-2.6 and FileField 6.x-3.3 was tested and shown
to be vulnerable.

Impact
- ------
Users who have rights to create content may upload files (including
images) with malicious names that could result in script execution.
This could result in administrative account compromise leading to web
server process compromise.

Mitigating factors:
- -------------------
Attacker must have rights to create content of a type that employs an
FileField CCK element.  This would include most content that had
attachments including imagery, documents, etc.

Additionally, Drupal's file handling must be set to Public in the File
system settings at ?q=admin/settings/file-system.  This is the default
configuration.

Vendor has responded by releasing a fixed version and a detailed
security announcement.  Vendor response is fully detailed in
