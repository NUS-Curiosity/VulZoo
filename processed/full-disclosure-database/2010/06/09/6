Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 June 09 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Cisco Application Extension Platform contains a privilege escalation
vulnerability in the tech support diagnostic shell that may allow an

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following products are affected by this vulnerability:

  * Cisco Application Extension Platform version 1.1
  * Cisco Application Extension Platform version 1.1.5 if upgraded from
    version 1.1

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The following products are not affected by this vulnerability:

  * Cisco Application Extension Platform version 1.0
  * Cisco Application Extension Platform version 1.1.5 if upgraded from version
    1.0 or a clean installation
  * Cisco Application Extension Platform version 1.1.7
  * Cisco Application Extension Platform version 1.5.x

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco Application Extension Platform (AXP) allows third-party applications
to be hosted on Cisco Integrated Services Routers (ISR). A privilege escalation
vulnerability exists in command-line interface of the the tech support
diagnostic shell that may allow an authenticated user to obtain complete
administrative access to vulnerable Cisco AXP module. The tech support shell is
accessed using the "techsupport support shell" command.

Authenticated Cisco AXP users can use an application programming interface
(API) to execute commands on the Cisco ISR that is hosting the AXP module. It
may be possible for an AXP user to obtain sensitive configuration information
that allows the user to gain access to the ISR device. Cisco AXP version 1.5
requires that a user be configured in the ISR configuration before the AXP user
can execute commands using the API.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtb65413 and has been
assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2010-1572.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory based on the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in this Security
Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability severity
and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then compute
environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the vulnerability
in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS at:

existing agreements with third-party support organizations, such as Cisco
Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers should contact that
support organization for guidance and assistance with the appropriate course of
action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific customer
situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and
organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,
customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to
ensure any applied workaround or fix is the most appropriate for use in the
intended network before it is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service
contract, and customers who purchase through third-party vendors but are
unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should
acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC
