====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the
BookLibrary component for Joomla, which can be exploited by malicious
people to conduct SQL injection attacks.

1) Input passed via the "bid[]" parameter to index.php (when "option"
is set to "com_booklibrary" and "task" is set to "lend_request") is
not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query. This can be
exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.

2) Input passed via the "bid[]" parameter to index.php (when "option"
is set to "com_booklibrary" and "task" is set to "save_lend_request")
is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query. This can
be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL
code.

Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.

3) Input passed via the "id" parameter to index.php (when "option" is
set to "com_booklibrary" and "task" is set to "mdownload" or
"downitsf") is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL
query. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting
arbitrary SQL code.

4) Input passed via the "searchtext" parameter to index.php (when
"option" is set to "com_booklibrary" and "task" is set to "search")
is not properly sanitised before being used in a SQL query. This can
be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL
code.

Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.
