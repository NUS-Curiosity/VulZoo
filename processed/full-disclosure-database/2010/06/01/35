Synopsis
========

Stack-based buffer overflows in Transmission may allow for remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Transmission is a cross-platform BitTorrent client.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-p2p/transmission       < 1.92                         >= 1.92

Description
===========

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the tr_magnetParse() function
in libtransmission/magnet.c have been discovered.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service or possibly execute
arbitrary code via a crafted magnet URL with a large number of tr or ws
links.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Transmission users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-p2p/transmission-1.92"
