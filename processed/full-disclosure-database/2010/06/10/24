Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.07.10: Multiple
 Vendor WebKit HTML Caption Use After Free Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.07.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 07, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

WebKit is an open source web browser engine. It is currently used by
Apple Inc.'s Safari browser, as well as by Google's Chrome browser. For
more information, see the vendor's site at the following link.

http://webkit.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in WebKit, as
included with multiple vendors' browsers, could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. Google
Chrome browsers to parse and render web content.

The vulnerability occurs when the a certain property of an HTML element
with a caption is reset via JavaScript code. When this occurs, a C++
object is incorrectly accessed after it has been freed. This results in
an attacker controlled value being used as a C++ VTABLE, which leads to
the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious webpage
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted
sites. After the user visits the malicious web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Google
Chrome (3.0.195.38 and 4.0.249.78), and Safari 4.0.4 (Windows XP/OS X
10.5.8). Previous versions are suspected to be vulnerable, as are any
other browsers or applications that make use of the WebKit engine.
Safari versions prior to 4.1 and 5.0 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

The vulnerability is present in the JavaScript engine, so disabling
JavaScript is an effective workaround. This can be performed via the
command line with Google Chrome, and the Preferences menu in Safari.
