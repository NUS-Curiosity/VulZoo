Subject: ref_fuzz and other fun bugs

Belated, but here are some recent bugs that you guys might find interesting:

1) DOM reference fuzzer, originally developed in 2008, crashed every
browser on the market back then:

Several of the bugs triggered by the fuzzer were rediscovered
independently in the two years it took vendors to investigate; most
notably, looks like the winning Pwn2own bug is a duplicate of this.
The release of Microsoft MS10-035 and Apple APPLE-SA-2010-06-21-1
probably fixes the last of the known exploitable issues triggered by
this tool. Probably not a great argument in favor of limited
disclosure.

2) Safari SOP bypass (CVE-2010-0544) - the story is amusing by the
virtue of spanning more than one decade:

3) Address bar spoofing in Firefox (CVE-2010-1206):

4) Some more fun with selective mid-keystroke focus redirection in
WebKit-based browsers (CVE-2010-1422):
