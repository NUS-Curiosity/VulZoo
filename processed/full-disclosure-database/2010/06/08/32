Subject: Re: RSA Key Manager SQL injection Vulnerability (
	CVE-2010-1904 )

The only problem is that the upgrade is not free, so you either pay up
or stay vulnerable. Great approach from a "great" security power house
:-) Imagine Microsoft saying, "this is not a problem in Windows 7, so
we recommend you pay up to upgrade to the latest version of Windows
and you should be all set" :-)
