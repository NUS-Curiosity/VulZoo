-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's Webkit. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the WebKit library handles
recursively defined Use elements. Upon expanding the target of the use
element within the tree, the application will create a dual-reference of
a Use element. Upon page deconstruction the application will destroy the
single reference and then attempt to destroy the second one that is
currently occupying the recently freed memory. Successful exploitation
can lead to code execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
