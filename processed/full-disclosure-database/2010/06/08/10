-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute remote code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Webkit. User interaction is required
in that a target must be coerced into visiting a malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within Webkit's process for destructing
attribute objects via the removeChild method. If an attribute's child
object is accessed after the attribute was removed from the document, an
invalid pointer is referenced. This can be exploited by an attacker to
execute remote code under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
