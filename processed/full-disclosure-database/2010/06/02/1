Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in FreeType might result in the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

FreeType is a True Type Font rendering library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package   /       Vulnerable       /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  freetype     < 1.4_pre20080316-r2           >= 1.4_pre20080316-r2

Description
===========

Multiple issues found in FreeType 2 were also discovered in FreeType 1.
For details on these issues, please review the Gentoo Linux Security
Advisories and CVE identifiers referenced below.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TTF
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running FreeType.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FreeType 1 users should upgrade to an unaffected version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
    ">=media-libs/freetype-1.4_pre20080316-r2"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since May 27, 2009. It is likely that your system is already
no longer affected by this issue.
