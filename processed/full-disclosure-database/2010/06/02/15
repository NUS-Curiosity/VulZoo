Synopsis
========

multipath-tools does not set correct permissions on the socket file,
making it possible to send arbitrary commands to the multipath daemon
for local users.

Background
==========

multipath-tools are used to drive the Device Mapper multipathing
driver.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-fs/multipath-tools     < 0.4.8-r1                 >= 0.4.8-r1

Description
===========

multipath-tools uses world-writable permissions for the socket file
(/var/run/multipathd.sock).

Impact
======

Local users could send arbitrary commands to the multipath daemon,
causing cluster failures and data loss.

Workaround
==========

chmod o-rwx /var/run/multipath.sock

Resolution
==========

All multipath-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-fs/multipath-tools-0.4.8-r1"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since November 13, 2009. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
