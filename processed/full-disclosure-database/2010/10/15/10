October 15, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3751

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
RealNetworks

-- Affected Products:
RealNetworks RealPlayer


-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the RealPlayer ActiveX control. This
module is responsible for handling the tfile, pnmm, cdda, protocol
handlers. While parsing a long argument ending with ".smil" an attacker
can overflow a buffer on the heap. This can be abused to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the user invoking the control.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
