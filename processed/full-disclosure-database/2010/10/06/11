ZDI-10-192: Adobe Acrobat Reader ICC mluc Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-192
October 6, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3622

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Reader

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required
in that a target must be coerced into opening a file or visiting a web
page.

The specific flaw exists within the ACE.dll module responsible for
parsing ICC streams. Within the 'desc' tag there exists an embedded
'mluc' data structure. The code within ACE performs arithmetic on the
second DWORD from the mluc structure and a value from the desc
structure. The resulting integer is used for an allocation of a
heap-based buffer. An attacker can forge these values to force the
process to under-allocate this buffer and later overflow it during a
copy operation. This leads to remote code execution under the context of
the user running the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
