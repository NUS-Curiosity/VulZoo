3. *Vulnerability Description*

While investigating the OpenType Compact Font Format vulnerability
disclosed in MS10-037, Diego Juarez discovered another kernel bug in the
parsing of OTF files. Loading a malformed OpenType font can cause the
entire system to crash. The vulnerability could be used locally by
attackers with access to an unprivileged account to elevate privileges
to those of a System Adminsitrator.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Windows XP
   . Windows 2003


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . Windows Vista
   . Windows 2008
   . Windows 7


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Microsoft has released security bulletin MS10-078
[http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=201084] addressing this issue.


7. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Diego Juarez from
Core Security Technologies. Publication was coordinated by Ivan Arce and
Jorge Lucangeli Obes.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

The vulnerability occurs in the font cache. A well-formed font is
loaded, and thus stored in the cache. Afterwards, the same font is
reloaded, but with invalid 'offset' and 'length' fields for the 'head'
table of the font. The 'offset' field is located at offset '0x64' in the
file, and the 'length' field is located at offset '0x68'. A valid
OpenType font:
