ZDI-10-201: Oracle Database Java Stored Procedure Race Condition Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-201
October 12, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-2419

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

-- Affected Products:
Oracle Database Server

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to break out of the Java
Sandbox implemented by Oracle's relational database. Authentication is
required in that a user must be able to create a Java stored procedure
to trigger the issue.

The specific flaw exists within Oracle's custom SecurityManager
implementation. Due to the implementation's dependence on a flag of a
particular object to determine success or failure of a privileged call,
a race condition exists which will allow one to execute Java code
bypassing the sandbox. Successful exploitation will allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the server.

-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
