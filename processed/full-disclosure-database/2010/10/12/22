-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Oracle Java Runtime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the JP2IEXP.dll responsible for handling
the Java plugin within Internet Explorer. When an applet is embedded
within a page, the code within this module parses out the docbase
parameter and copies it into a fixed-length buffer located on the stack.
An attacker can overflow this buffer and execute remote code under the
context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
