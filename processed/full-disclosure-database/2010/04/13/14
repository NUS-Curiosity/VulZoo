-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows Media Player. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious web page.

The specific flaw exists within the functionality for retrieving a codec
for an unknown fourCC compression code. If an embedded Windows Media
Player control attempts to play a media file containing an unknown codec
it makes a request to Microsoft to retrieve the necessary capability. If
the control is removed from the page while attempting to do this,
cleanup routines will call an already freed pointer. An attacker can
leverage this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user
running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
