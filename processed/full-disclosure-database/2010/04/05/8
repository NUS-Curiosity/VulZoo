ZDI-10-055: Sun Java Runtime Environment Mutable InetAddress Socket Policy Violation Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-10-055
April 5, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-0095

-- Affected Vendors:
Sun Microsystems

-- Affected Products:
Sun Microsystems Java Runtime

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to violate security policies
on vulnerable installations of Sun Java Runtime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must run a
malicious applet.

The specific flaw allows malicious applets to connect to network
addresses other than the originating applet and client IPs. A
handcrafted applet can override compile time checks to prevent
compilation of a mutable InetAddress subclass. This results in the
ability to circumvent the Applet SecurityManager restictions.

-- Vendor Response:
Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
