Subject: TaskFreak 0.6.2 SQL Injection Vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

CVE-2010-1583

Vendor notified and product update released.
Details of this report are also available at
 http://www.madirish.net/?article=456

Description of Vulnerability:
- ------------------------------
The Tirzen Framework (http://www.tirzen.net/tzn/) is a supporting API
developed by Tirzen (http://www.tirzen.com), an intranet and internet
solutions provider.  The Tirzen Framework contains a SQL injection
vulnerability (http://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection).  This
vulnerability could allow an attacker to arbitrarily manipulate SQL
strings constructed using the library.  This vulnerability manifests
itself most notably in the Task Freak (http://www.taskfreak.com/) open
source task management software.  The vulnerability can be exploited to
bypass authentication and gain administrative access to the Task Freak
system.

Systems affected:
- ------------------
Task Freak Multi User / mySQL v0.6.2 with Tirzen Framework 1.5 was
tested and shown to be vulnerable.

Impact
- -------
Attackers could manipulate database query strings resulting in
information disclosure, data destruction, authentication bypass, etc.

Technical discussion and proof of concept:
- -------------------------------------------
Tirzen Framework class TznDbConnection in the function loadByKey()
(tzn_mysql.php line 605) manifests a SQL injection vulnerability because
it fails to sanitize user supplied input used to compose SQL statements.

Proof of concept: any user can log into TaskFreak as the administrator
simply by using the username "1' or 1='1"

Vendor response:
- ----------------
Upgrade to the latest version of TaskFreak.
