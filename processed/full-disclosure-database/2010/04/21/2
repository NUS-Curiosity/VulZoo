Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Small Business Video Surveillance
Cameras and Cisco 4-Port Gigabit Security Routers Authentication Bypass
Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100421-vsc

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100421-vsc.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 APR 21 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Small Business Video Surveillance Cameras and Cisco RVS4000 4-port
Gigabit Security Routers contain a vulnerability that could allow an
authenticated user to view passwords for other users, regardless of the
authenticated user's level of authorization.

An unprivileged user could take advantage of this vulnerability to
gain full administrative access on the device or view another user's
credentials.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are
available on some devices.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100421-vsc.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

This vulnerability affects the Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security
Router and all Cisco Small Business Video Surveillance Cameras, except
for the Cisco PVC300 Pan Tilt Optical Zoom Camera. These cameras are
affected:

  * Cisco PVC2300 Business Internet Video Camera - Audio/PoE
  * Cisco WVC200 Wireless-G PTZ Internet Video Camera - Audio
  * Cisco WVC210 Wireless-G PTZ Internet Video Camera - 2-way Audio
  * Cisco WVC2300 Wireless-G Business Internet Video Camera - Audio

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The Cisco PVC300 Pan Tilt Optical Zoom Camera and Cisco Small Business
cameras are not affected by this vulnerability.

No other Cisco cameras or products are currently known to be affected by
this vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco Small Business Video Surveillance Cameras are a component of
network-based, physical security solutions. More information on the
surveillance cameras can be found at this link:

http://www.cisco.com/cisco/web/solutions/small_business/products/security/small_business_video_surveillance_cameras/index.html

The Small Business Video Surveillance Cameras are connected to an IP
network and are remotely accessible for both surveillance and device
management. An administrator can restrict a user's ability to manage the
device, allowing the user to employ the camera for surveillance only.

The Cisco RVS4000 Gigabit Security Router delivers high-speed network
access and IPsec VPN capabilities for as many as five users. The
Cisco RVS4000 also provides firewall and intrusion prevention
capabilities. More information on the Cisco RVS4000 Gigabit Security
Router can be found at this link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9928/index.html

A user on the PVC2300 and WVC2300 cameras can use a specifically crafted
URL to bypass any restrictions that are configured to prevent the device
configuration from being viewed. The user could then view the passwords
for all users on the device.

A user on the WVC200 and WVC210 camera must have been granted setup
privileges to take advantage of this vulnerability to view the
passwords. The ability to configure setup privileges is not available on
the other devices affected by this vulnerability.

Administrative users on the RVS4000 router may be able to view the
passwords of other administrative users.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCte64726 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2010-0593.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory based
on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in
this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the
vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS
at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

* CSCte64726 ("Unprivileged users may be able to view passwords for
other users")

CVSS Base Score - 9.0
    Access Vector -            Network
    Access Complexity -        Low
    Authentication -           Single
    Confidentiality Impact -   Complete
    Integrity Impact -         Complete
    Availability Impact -      Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 7.4
    Exploitability -           Functional
    Remediation Level -        Official-Fix
    Report Confidence -        Confirmed


Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an
authenticated user to discover all the user passwords contained on the
device. The user could use the passwords to gain full administrative
access to the device and any other devices that use a common password.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

To determine the software version running on a camera, administrators
can click the "About" tab at the top-right of the device user interface.
The software version information can be obtained on the System Status
page under the "Status" tab.

The latest camera software can be downloaded at:

http://tools.cisco.com/support/downloads/go/Redirect.x?mdfid=282414029

The software version of the RVS4000 is displayed on the main router page
displayed after users log in.

The latest RVS4000 software can be downloaded at:

http://tools.cisco.com/support/downloads/pub/Redirect.x?mdfid=282413304

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Small Business Support Center or your contracted maintenance
provider for assistance.
