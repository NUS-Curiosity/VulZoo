Package        : tor
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2010-1676


Willem Pinckaers discovered that Tor, a tool to enable online anonymity,
does not correctly handle all data read from the network.  By supplying
specially crafted packets a remote attacker can cause Tor to overflow its
heap, crashing the process. Arbitrary code execution has not been
confirmed but there is a potential risk.

In the stable distribution (lenny), this update also includes an update of
the IP address for the Tor directory authority gabelmoo and addresses
a weakness in the package's postinst maintainer script.


For the stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.26-1~lenny+4.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.1.26-6.


We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.
