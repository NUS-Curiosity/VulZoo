Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 12.07.10: Apple
 QuickTime PICT Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.07.10
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Dec 07, 2010

I. BACKGROUND

QuickTime is Apple's media player product used to render video and other
media. The PICT file format was developed by Apple Inc. in 1984. PICT
files can contain both object-oriented images and bitmaps. For more
information visit http://www.apple.com/quicktime/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in Apple Inc.'s
QuickTime media player could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
in the context of the targeted user.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the way specially crafted PICT
image files are handled by the QuickTime PictureViewer.

When processing specially crafted PICT image files, Quicktime
PictureViewer uses a set value from the file to control the length of a
byte swap operation. The byte swap operation is used to convert big
endian data to little endian data. QuickTime fails to validate the
length value properly before using it. When a length value is larger
than the actual buffer size supplied, it will corrupt heap memory
beyond the allocated buffer, which could lead to an exploitable
condition.

III. ANALYSIS

Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code
in the context of the current user. To exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker must persuade a victim into using QuickTime to open a
specially crafted PICT picture file. This could be accomplished by
either direct link or referenced from a website under the attacker's
control. An attacker could host a Web page containing a malformed PICT
file. Upon visiting the malicious Web page exploitation would occur and
execution of arbitrary code would be possible. Alternatively a PICT file
could be attached within an e-mail file.

IV. DETECTION

QuickTime Player versions prior to 7.6.9 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense recommends disabling the QuickTime Plugin and altering the
.pct, .pic and .pict filetype associations within the registry.
Disabling the plugin will prevent Web browsers from utilizing QuickTime
Player to view associated media files. Removing the filetype
associations within the registry will prevent QuickTime Player and
Picture Viewer from opening .pct, .pic and .pict files.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
