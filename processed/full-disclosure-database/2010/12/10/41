-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious media file.

The specific flaw exists in the parsing of GIF87a files over the
streaming protocol RTSP. When specifying a large Screen Width size in
the Screen Descriptor header a calculation on the destination heap
chunks size is improperly checked for overflow. This leads to a smaller
buffer being allocated and subsequently a heap overflow when processing
the received data. Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to system
compromise under the credentials of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
