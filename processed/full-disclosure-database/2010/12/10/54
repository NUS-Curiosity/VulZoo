-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within RealPlayer's handling of Internet Video
Recording (.ivr) files. While parsing the MLTI chunk the process trusts
the field responsible for denoting the number of streams within the
chunk. By modifying this value in an IVR file, an attacker can force a
processing loop to overrun and corrupt heap memory. This can be abused
to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user invoking
RealPlayer.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
