-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists when parsing a RealMedia file containing a
malformed multi-rate audio stream. The application explicitly trusts two
16-bit values in this data structure which are then used to calculate
the size used for an allocation. When data is written to this allocated
buffer, an overflow will occur which can lead to code execution under
the context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
