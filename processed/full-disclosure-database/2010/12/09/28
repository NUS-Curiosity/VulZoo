December 9, 2010

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3766

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Mozilla Firefox

-- Affected Products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the application's support of the
NodeIterator API used for element traversal. Due to a particular element
not implementing functionality required by the API, a use-after free
vulnerability can be forced to occur. This can be used to achieve code
execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla Firefox has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
