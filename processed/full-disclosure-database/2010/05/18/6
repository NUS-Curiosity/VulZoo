Subject: GhostScript Vulnerability Clarification -
	CVE-2010-1869

Dear List,

I'm writing on behalf of the Check Point Vulnerability Discovery Team to clarify this issue.   Here is our advisory and the specific timeline:

GhostScript 8.70 and lower stack overflow


INTRODUCTION

Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript language and the Portable Document Format (PDF).

There exists a vulnerability within the parser function that when properly exploited can lead to remote comprimise of the vulnerable system, both thru client-side exploitation (using applications like Imagemagick) or server-side exploitation (using cups printer daemon). For both cases
there is a working exploit to be shared with interested parts.

This vulnerability was confirmed in the following GhostScript versions:

8.70
8.64


DETAILS

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PostScript file (client-side exploitation scenario) or just print the file (server-sie exploitation scenario), possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application or the printer daemon.

Different Unix vendors and Linux distributions are vulnerable to that due to the usage of the vulnerable GhostScript version.

The following test was made on a PCBSD 8.0 default install.  There is a working exploit for the vulnerability to test the exploitability in different systems.  Propolice protection mitigates this vulnerability.

$ gs --version
8.70
$ gdb gs
...
...
(gdb) r crash.ps
...

We can use the Cupsd to trigger the vulnerability in the gs process.

$ lp -d hpdskjet crash.pdf
$ grep crashed /var/log/cups/error_log

WORKAROUND

Upgrade to GhostScript version 8.71.
