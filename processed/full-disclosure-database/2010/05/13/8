4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Free Download
Manager, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise
a user's system.

The "name" attribute of the "file" element of metalink files is not
properly sanitised before being used to download files. If a user is
tricked into downloading from a specially crafted metalink file, this
can be exploited to download files to directories outside of the
