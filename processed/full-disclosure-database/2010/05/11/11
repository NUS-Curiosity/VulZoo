-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-1552

-- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

-- Affected Products:
Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager

TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 9268.

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Network Node Manager. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the snmpviewer.exe CGI. The doLoad
function in this process calls sprintf() with a %s format specifier and
unsanitized user input retrieved from two separate POST variables (act
and app). By providing large enough strings a remote attacker can cause
a stack-based buffer overflow and eventually execute arbitrary code
under the context of the webserver process.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
