Description:
    Openssl has been patched to address multiple vulnerabilities;
    see the listed CVEs for details.  Most importantly, this update 
    adds support for the TLS Renegotiation Indication Extension as
    specified in RFC-5746, to address man-in-the-middle attack
    weaknesses in the TLS protocol.
