Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Firewall Services Module Skinny Client
Control Protocol Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100217-fwsm

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100217-fwsm.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 February 17 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability exists in the Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) for
the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers
that may cause the Cisco FWSM to reload after processing a malformed
Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP) message. The vulnerability exists
when SCCP inspection is enabled.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100217-fwsm.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

All non-fixed 4.x versions of Cisco FWSM Software are affected by this
vulnerability if SCCP inspection is enabled. SCCP inspection is enabled
by default.

To check if SCCP inspection is enabled, issue the "show service-policy
| include skinny" command and confirm that the command returns output.
Example output follows:

    fwsm#show service-policy | include skinny
          Inspect: skinny , packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0

Alternatively, a device that has SCCP inspection enabled has a
configuration similar to the following:

    class-map inspection_default
     match default-inspection-traffic
    !
    policy-map global_policy
     class inspection_default
      ...
      inspect skinny
      ...
    !
    service-policy global_policy global

To determine the version of Cisco FWSM Software that is running, issue
the "show module" command-line interface (CLI) command from Cisco IOS
Software or Cisco Catalyst Operating System Software to identify what
modules and sub modules are installed on the system.

The following example shows a system with a Cisco FWSM (WS-SVC-FWM-1)
installed in slot 2:

    switch>show module
    Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.

    [...]

After locating the correct slot, issue the "show module <slot number>"
command to identify the software version that is running. Example output
follows:

    switch>show module 2
    Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.

    [...]

The preceding example shows that the FWSM is running software version
3.2(2)10 as indicated by the column under "Sw."

Note: Recent versions of Cisco IOS Software will show the software
version of each module in the output from the "show module" command;
therefore, executing the "show module <slot number>" command is not
necessary.

If a Virtual Switching System (VSS) is used to allow two physical Cisco
Catalyst 6500 Series Switches to operate as a single logical virtual
switch, the "show module switch all" command can display the software
version of all FWSMs that belong to switch 1 and switch 2. The output
from this command will be similar to the output from the "show module
<slot number>" but will include module information for the modules in
each switch in the VSS.

Alternatively, version information can be obtained directly from the
FWSM through the "show version" command. Example output follows:

    FWSM> show version

    FWSM Firewall Version 3.2(2)10

    [...]

Customers who use the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to
manage their devices can find the version of the software displayed in
the table in the login window or in the upper left corner of the ASDM
window. The version notation is similar to the following example.

    FWSM Version: 3.2(2)10

Details
=======

The Cisco FWSM is a high-speed, integrated firewall module for Cisco
Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers. The FWSM
offers firewall services with stateful packet filtering and deep packet
inspection.

The Cisco FWSM is affected by a vulnerability that may cause the device
to reload during the processing of a malformed SCCP message when SCCP
inspection is enabled.

This vulnerability is only triggered by transit traffic; traffic that is
destined to the device does not trigger this vulnerability.

This issue is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtb60485 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2010-0151.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause a reload of
the affected device. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained
denial of service condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco FWSM Software table below describes a major Cisco
FWSM Software train and the earliest possible release within that train
that contains the fix (the "First Fixed Release") and the anticipated
date of availability (if not currently available) in the "First Fixed
Release" column. A device running a release that is earlier than the
release in a specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is
known to be vulnerable. The release should be upgraded at least to the
indicated release or a later version (greater than or equal to the First
Fixed Release label).

+---------------------------------------+
| Major Release  | First Fixed Release  |
|----------------+----------------------|
| 3.1            | Not affected         |
|----------------+----------------------|
| 3.2            | Not affected         |
