-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass specific script
execution enforcements on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox.
User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the
target must visit a malicious page.

Through usage of the showModalDialog() JavaScript method an attacker can
gather sensitive information from another website. This vulnerability
can be exploited to obtain website credentials not originating from the
attacking site.
