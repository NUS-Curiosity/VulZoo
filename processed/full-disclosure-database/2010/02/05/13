Subject: Re: [SECURITY] [DSA-1988-1] New qt4-x11 packages
	fix several vulnerabilities

As far as I know it's been done. The question isn't writing a virus
for linux, but rather attacking linux.
Pirus, ran on linux since linux comes bundled with PHP, as other
script virii. Linux also supports a lot of scripting languages, unlike
Windows which supports less (batch/js/vb/hta).
This doesn't implying anything except that desktop linux doesn't yet
have a wide user base to make it relevant to malware writes.
On the other hand, linux servers are attacked a lot, and if memory
serves me right, a lot more then Windows ones.

Cheers.
