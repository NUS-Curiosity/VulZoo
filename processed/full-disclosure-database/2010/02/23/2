====================================================================== 
1) Affected Software 

* Bournal 1.4

NOTE: Other versions may also be affected.

====================================================================== 
2) Severity 

Rating: Not critical

Where:  Local system

====================================================================== 
3) Vendor's Description of Software 

"Bournal is a bash script that allows you to keep a personal,
minimalistic, password-protected journal, log, or diary. It includes
encryption, regexp searches, and a date-sorted list for editing old
entries. Since Bournal is pure bash, it should be easily editable
for the CLI-savvy.".

====================================================================== 
4) Description of Security Issue

Secunia Research has discovered a security issue in Bournal, which
can be exploited by malicious, local users to disclose sensitive 
information.

The script uses e.g. the insecure "-K" command line parameter to
pass the key to the ccrypt utilities, which can be exploited to
obtain the key from the list of running processes.

Note: This may not affect recent Linux versions, but is confirmed for
FreeBSD 8.0. Other systems may also be affected.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Fixed in version 1.4.1 by preventing the use of the script on FreeBSD
systems. This may still affect other systems where users have access
to the full command line of other user's processes, despite ccrypt
disabling "echoing" on the terminal.

======================================================================
