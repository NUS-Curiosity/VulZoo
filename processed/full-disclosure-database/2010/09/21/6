Synopsis
========

Multiple Denial of Services vulnerabilities were found in libxml2.

Background
==========

libxml2 is a library to manipulate XML files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/libxml2     < 2.7.3-r2                       >= 2.7.3-r2

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were reported after a test with the
Codenomicon XML fuzzing framework:

* Two use-after-free vulnerabilities are possible when parsing a XML
  file with Notation or Enumeration attribute types (CVE-2009-2416).

* A stack consumption vulnerability can be triggered via a large
  depth of element declarations in a DTD, related to a function
  recursion (CVE-2009-2414).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted XML document with an application using libxml2
resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libxml2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxml2-2.7.3-r2"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since August 30, 2009. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
