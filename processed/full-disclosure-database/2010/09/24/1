1. Summary

   VMware Workstation and Player address a potential installer security
   issue and security issues in libpng. VMware ACE Management Server
   (AMS) for Windows updates Apache httpd.

2. Relevant releases

   VMware Workstation 7.1.1 and earlier,
   VMware Player 3.1.1 and earlier,
   VMware ACE Management Server 2.7.1 and earlier,

   Note: VMware Server was declared End Of Availability on January 2010,
         support will be limited to Technical Guidance for the duration
         of the support term.

3. Problem Description

 a. VMware Workstation and Player installer security issue

    The Workstation 7.x and Player 3.x installers will load an index.htm
    file located in the current working directory on which Workstation
    7.x or Player 3.x is being installed. This may allow an attacker to
    display a malicious file if they manage to get their file onto the
    system prior to installation.

    The issue can only be exploited at the time that Workstation 7.x or
    Player 3.x is being installed. Installed versions of Workstation and
    Player are not affected. The security issue is no longer present in
    the installer of the new versions of Workstation 7.x and Player 3.x
    (see table below for the version numbers).

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2010-3277 to this issue.

    VMware would like to thank Alexander Trofimov and Marc Esher for
    independently reporting this issue to VMware.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch
    =============  ========  =======  =================
    VirtualCenter  any       Windows  not affected

    Workstation    7.x       any      7.1.2 build 301548 or later *
    Workstation    6.5.x     any      not affected

    Player         3.x       any      3.1.2 build 301548 or later *
    Player         2.5.x     any      not affected

    AMS            any       any      not affected

    Server         any       any      not affected

    Fusion         any       Mac OS/X not affected

    ESXi           any       ESXi     not affected

    ESX            any       ESX      not affected

 * Note: This only affects the installer, if you have a version of
         Workstation or Player installed you are not vulnerable.


 b. Third party libpng updated to version 1.2.44

    A buffer overflow condition in libpng is addressed that could
    potentially lead to code execution with the privileges of the
    application using libpng. Two potential denial of service issues
    are also addressed in the update.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2010-1205, CVE-2010-0205, CVE-2010-2249
    to these issues.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.


    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch
    =============  ========  =======  =================
    VirtualCenter  any       Windows  not affected

    Workstation    7.1.x     any      7.1.2 build 301548 or later
    Workstation    6.5.x     any      affected, patch pending

    Player         3.1.x     any      3.1.2 build 301548 or later
    Player         2.5.x     any      affected, patch pending

    AMS            any       any      not affected

    Server         any       any      affected, no patch planned

    Fusion         any       Mac OS/X not affected

    ESXi           any       ESXi     not affected

    ESX            any       ESX      not affected


 c. VMware ACE Management Server (AMS) for Windows updates Apache httpd
    version 2.2.15.

    A function in Apache HTTP Server when multithreaded MPM is used
    does not properly handle headers in subrequests in certain
    circumstances which may allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
    information via a crafted request that triggers access to memory
    locations associated with an earlier request.

    The Apache mod_isapi module can be forced to unload a specific
    library before the processing of a request is complete, resulting
    in memory corruption. This vulnerability may allow a remote
    attacker to execute arbitrary code.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2010-0434 and CVE-2010-0425 to the
    issues addressed in this update.

    Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.

    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch
    =============  ========  =======  =================
    VirtualCenter  any       Windows  not affected

    Workstation    any       any      not affected

    Player         any       any      not affected

    AMS            any       Windows  2.7.2 build 301548 or later
    AMS            any       Linux    affected, patch pending *

    Server         any       any      not affected

    Fusion         any       Mac OS/X not affected

    ESXi           any       ESXi     not affected

    ESX            any       ESX      not affected

 * Note CVE-2010-0425 is not applicable to AMS running on Linux
