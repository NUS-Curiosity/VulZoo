Cisco IOS SSL VPN Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100922-sslvpn

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-sslvpn.shtml

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 September 22 1600 UTC (GMT)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IOS  Software contains a vulnerability when the Cisco IOS SSL
VPN feature is configured with an HTTP redirect. Exploitation could
allow a remote, unauthenticated user to cause a memory leak on the
affected devices, that could result in a memory exhaustion condition
that may cause device reloads, the inability to service new TCP
connections, and other denial of service (DoS) conditions.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. There is a workaround to mitigate this vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at 
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100922-sslvpn.shtml

Note: The September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. Five of
the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each advisory lists the releases that correct the
vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory. The table
at the following URL lists releases that correct all Cisco IOS
Software vulnerabilities that have been published on September 22,
2010, or earlier:

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Devices running affected versions of Cisco IOS Software are
vulnerable if configured with SSL VPN and HTTP port redirection.

The following methods may be used to confirm if the device is
configured for Cisco IOS SSL VPNs and is vulnerable:

If the output from show running-config | include webvpn contains
"webvpn gateway <word>" then the device is supporting the Cisco IOS
SSL VPN feature. A device is vulnerable if it has the inservice
command in at least one of the "webvpn gateway" sections and is
configured for HTTP port redirection. The following example shows a
vulnerable device configured with Cisco IOS SSL VPN:

    Router#show running | section webvpn
    webvpn gateway Gateway
     ip address 10.1.1.1 port 443
     http-redirect port 80
     ssl trustpoint Gateway-TP
     inservice
     !
    Router#

A device that supports the Cisco IOS SSL VPN is not vulnerable if
"webvpn gateway" is not configured.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
show version command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of
C2800NM-ADVSECURITYK9-M:

    Router#show version
    Cisco IOS Software, 2800 Software (C2800NM-ADVSECURITYK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)

  * Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances
  * Cisco IOS XR Software
  * Cisco IOS XE Software

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco IOS SSL VPN feature provides remote access to enterprise
sites to users anywhere on the Internet. The SSL VPN provides users
with secure access to specific enterprise applications, such as
e-mail and web browsing, without requiring them to have VPN client
software installed on their end-user devices.

Further information about Cisco IOS SSL VPN is available in the
"Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4T SSL VPN feature guide" at the
following link: 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_4t/12_4t11/htwebvpn.html leavingcisco.com

A device configured for SSL VPN with HTTP port redirection may leak
transmission control blocks (TCBs) when processing an abnormally
disconnected SSL session. Continued exploitation may cause the device
to deplete memory resources, which could result in device reloads,
the inability to service new TCP connections, and other DoS
conditions. Authentication is not required to exploit this
vulnerability.

A complete TCP 3-way handshake is required to exploit this
vulnerability. The memory leak can be detected by running the command
show tcp brief as shown in the following example:

    Router#show tcp brief
    TCB       Local Address      Foreign Address     (state)
    468BBDC0  192.168.0.22.80   192.168.0.33.19794   CLOSEWAIT

    482901D8  192.168.0.22.80   192.168.0.33.16200   CLOSEWAIT

In the output above, the Transmission Control Blocks (TCBs) in the
state CLOSEWAIT will not transition and represent a memory leak. Note
that only TCP connections with a local TCP port of 80 (the well-known
port for HTTP), as evidenced in the above example by a Local Address
of 192.168.0.22.80, are relevant.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtg21685 
and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier

Cisco IOS XR System Software
+---------------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by the vulnerabilities
disclosed in the September 22, 2010, Cisco IOS Software Security
Advisory bundled publication.

Workarounds
===========

Disabling HTTP redirection for SSL VPN connections can be used as a
workaround for this vulnerability. HTTP redirection for SSL VPN
connections is disabled by executing the command no http-redirect
port in webvpn gateway configuration mode.

In addition, manually clearing the hung TCBs with the command clear
tcp tcb * will transition the TCBs into a CLOSED state. After a time
they will clear the CLOSED state and the memory will be released.

Note:  Clearing the TCB will clear both legitimate and hung
connections, including remote connections to the device such as
Telnet and SSH connections.

The Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin (AMB) "Identifying and
Mitigating Exploitation of the TCP State Manipulation Denial of
Service Vulnerabilities in Multiple Cisco Products", available at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20090908-tcp24.shtml,
contains two mitigations (EEM scripts and SNMP) that can be used to
detect and clear hung TCP connections.

Embedded Event Manager (EEM)
+---------------------------

A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool
Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to
identify and detect a hung, extended, or indefinite TCP connection
that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows
administrators to monitor TCP connections on a Cisco IOS device. When
Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability,
the policy can trigger a response by sending a syslog message or a
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) trap to clear the TCP
connection. The example policy provided in this document is based on
a Tcl script that monitors and parses the output from two commands at
defined intervals, produces a syslog message when the monitor
threshold reaches its configured value, and can reset the TCP
connection.

The Tcl script is available for download at the "Cisco Beyond:
Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community" at the following
link: http://forums.cisco.com/eforum/servlet/EEM?page=eem&fn=script&scriptId=2041
A sample device configuration is provided below.


        !
        !-- Location where the Tcl script will be stored
        !

        event manager directory user policy disk0:/eem

        !
        !-- Define variable and set the monitoring interval
        !-- as an integer (expressed in seconds)
        !

        event manager environment EEM_MONITOR_INTERVAL 60

        !
        !-- Define variable and set the threshold value as
        !-- an integer for the number of retransmissions
        !-- that determine if the TCP connection is hung
        !-- (a recommended value to use is 15)
        !

        event manager environment EEM_MONITOR_THRESHOLD 15

        !
        !-- Define variable and set the value to "yes" to
        !-- enable the clearing of hung TCP connections
        !

        event manager environment EEM_MONITOR_CLEAR yes

        !
        !-- Define variable and set to the TCP connection
        !-- state or states that script will monitor, which
        !-- can be a single state or a space-separated list
        !-- of states
        !

        event manager environment EEM_MONITOR_STATES CLOSEWAIT

        !
        !-- Register the script as a Cisco EEM policy
        !

        event manager policy monitor-sockets.tcl

        !

Hung TCP Connection" and "Identification: Detecting and Clearing Hung
TCP Connection Using SNMP" of this AMB at the following link:

prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.
