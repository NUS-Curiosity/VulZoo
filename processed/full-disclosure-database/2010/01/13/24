Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in SquirrelMail of which the worst
results in remote code execution.

Background
==========

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mail-client/squirrelmail      < 1.4.19                  >= 1.4.19

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in SquirrelMail:

* Niels Teusink reported multiple input sanitation flaws in certain
  encrypted strings in e-mail headers, related to
  contrib/decrypt_headers.php, PHP_SELF and the query string (aka
  QUERY_STRING) (CVE-2009-1578).

* Niels Teusink also reported that the map_yp_alias() function in
  functions/imap_general.php does not filter shell metacharacters in a
  username and that the original patch was incomplete (CVE-2009-1381,
  CVE-2009-1579).

* Tomas Hoger discovered an unspecified session fixation
  vulnerability (CVE-2009-1580).

* Luc Beurton reported that functions/mime.php does not protect the
  application's content from Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) positioning
  in HTML e-mail messages (CVE-2009-1581).

Impact
======

The vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the web server, to hijack web
sessions via a crafted cookie, to spoof the user interface and to
conduct Cross-Site Scripting and phishing attacks, via a specially
crafted message.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SquirrelMail users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/squirrelmail-1.4.19"
