-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute code on vulnerable
installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required
in that a user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious web
site.

The specific flaw exists during the parsing of SIPR codec fields.
Specifying a small length value can trigger an undersized heap
allocation. This buffer can then subsequently be overflowed. This
vulnerability can result in arbitrary code execution under the context
of the currently logged in user.
