-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute code on vulnerable
installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required
in that a user must visit a malicious website or open a malicious file
and accept a dialog to switch player skins.

The specific flaw exists during parsing of malformed RealPlayer .RJS
skin files. While loading a skin the application copies certain variable
length fields from the extracted file named web.xmb into a statically
sized buffer. By crafting these fields appropriately an attack can cause
the process to overflow the buffer. This can be leveraged to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
