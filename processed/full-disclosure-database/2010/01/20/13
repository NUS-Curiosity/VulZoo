Cisco Security Advisory: CiscoWorks Internetwork Performance Monitor
CORBA GIOP Overflow Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20100120-ipm

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 January 20 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

CiscoWorks Internetwork Performance Monitor (IPM) versions 2.6 and
earlier for Microsoft Windows operating systems contain a buffer
overflow vulnerability that could allow a remote unauthenticated
attacker to execute arbitrary code. There are no workarounds for this
vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20100120-ipm.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

CiscoWorks IPM versions 2.6 and earlier for Windows operating systems
are affected.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

CiscoWorks IPM version 2.x for Sun Solaris and CiscoWorks IPM version
4.x for Windows and Solaris operating systems are not affected. No
other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

CiscoWorks IPM is a troubleshooting application that gauges network
response time and availability. CiscoWorks IPM is available as a
component within the CiscoWorks LAN Management Solution (LMS) bundle.
CiscoWorks IPM versions 2.6 and earlier for Windows contain a buffer
overflow vulnerability when processing Common Object Request Broker
Architecture (CORBA) GIOP requests. By sending a crafted CORBA GIOP
request, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to trigger
the buffer overflow condition and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM
privileges on affected Windows systems. This vulnerability is
documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsv62350 and has been assigned the
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) CVE-2010-0138.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

CSCsv62350 - Malformed CORBA GIOP request causes crash

CVSS Base Score - 10

Access Vector           - Network
Access Complexity       - Low
Authentication          - None
Confidentiality Impact  - Complete
Integrity Impact        - Complete
Availability Impact     - Complete

CVSS Temporal Score - 9.5

Exploitability          - Functional
Remediation Level       - Unavailable
Report Confidence       - Confirmed

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in the
ability to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on affected
Windows systems.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

Ciscoworks IPM versions 2.6 and earlier for Windows contain a
vulnerable third-party component that is no longer supported. Cisco
is unable to provide updated software for affected CiscoWorks
versions. Consult the "Obtaining Fixed Software" section of this
advisory for instructions on how to address vulnerable systems.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability. It is possible to
mitigate this vulnerability by restricting network access to TCP
ports on an affected Windows system running IPM versions 2.6 and
earlier to trusted systems.

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20100120-ipm.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Ciscoworks IPM versions 2.6 and earlier for Windows contain a
vulnerable third-party component that is no longer supported. Cisco
is unable to provide updated software for affected CiscoWorks
versions.

Customers with active software licenses for the IPM component of
CiscoWorks versions 2.6 and earlier for Windows should send email to
the following address for instructions on migrating to non-vulnerable
software:
