Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2010 Jan 27 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Cisco Unified MeetingPlace. This
security advisory outlines the details of these vulnerabilities:

  * Insufficient validation of SQL commands
  * Unauthorized account creation
  * User and password enumeration in Cisco MeetingTime
  * Privilege escalation in Cisco MeetingTime

Workarounds are not available for these vulnerabilities.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco Unified MeetingPlace versions 5, 6, and 7 are each affected by
at least one of the vulnerabilities described in this document.

The Cisco Unified MeetingPlace conferencing solution provides
functionality that allows organizations to host integrated voice,
video, and web conferencing. The solution is deployed on-network and
integrated directly into an organization's private voice/data
networks and enterprise applications. Cisco Unified MeetingPlace
servers can be deployed so that the server is accessible from the
Internet, allowing external parties to participate in meetings.

Cisco MeetingTime is a desktop application included with Cisco
Unified MeetingPlace version 6.x that could be used to access and
configure the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Audio Server systems.
MeetingTime classifies users as either end users, contacts,
attendants, or system administrators.

The end-of-software maintenance for MeetingPlace version 5.3 occurred
in April 2009. End-of-sale and end-of-life details are available at:

http://cco-rtp-1.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/voicesw/ps6789/ps5664/ps5669/prod_end-of-life_notice0900aecd806e743c.html

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

This Security Advisory describes multiple distinct vulnerabilities in
the MeetingPlace and MeetingTime products. These vulnerabilities are
independent of each other.

Insufficient Validation of SQL Commands

An unauthenticated user may be able to send SQL commands to
manipulate the database that MeetingPlace uses to store information
about server configuration, meetings, and users. These commands could
be used to create, delete, or alter any of the information contained
in the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace database.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtc39691
and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2010-0139.

Unauthorized Account Creation

An unauthenticated user may be able to send a crafted URL to the
internal interface of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace web server to
create a MeetingPlace user or administrator account.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug IDs CSCtc59231 
and CSCtd40661 and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2010-0140.

User and Password Enumeration in Cisco MeetingTime

The MeetingTime authentication sequence consists of a series of
packets that are transmitted between the client and the Cisco Meeting
Place Audio Server over TCP port 5001. An attacker may be able to
alter the authentication sequence to access sensitive information in
the user database including usernames and passwords.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsv76935
and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2010-0141.

Privilege Escalation in Cisco MeetingTime

An attacker may be able to alter the packets in the MeetingTime
authentication sequence to elevate the privileges of a normal user to
an administrative user.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsv66530 
and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2010-0142.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a
complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities described in this
advisory.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
