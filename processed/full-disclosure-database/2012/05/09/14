Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1172 CVE-2012-1823 CVE-2012-2311

De Eindbazen discovered that PHP, when run with mod_cgi, will
interpret a query string as command line parameters, allowing to
execute arbitrary code.

Additionally, this update fixes insufficient validation of upload
name which lead to corrupted $_FILES indices.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze9.

The testing distribution (wheezy) will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.3-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
