Subject: Re: [SECURITY] [DSA 2468-1] libjakarta-poi-java
 security update

Hi,

An explanation of this bug was sent to security@...che.org on 1st March,
but unfortuntaly it wasn't cc'd to the original reporter (Florian Weimer).

Please find the answer below.

The POI team believes that it is a regular bug rather than a security issue.

The problem happens when parsing a binary MS Word document and support
for MS Word has been greatly improved since the version 3.7.

The recommended solutions are (in the order of preference):

 -Try our latest release POI-3.8. There is a good chance the
problem is already fixed.
 - If the problem is still there, please create a new Bugzilla
entry and supply more information: the stack trace, the problematic
file that triggers OutOfMemoryError and any other details that may
help us to fix it.

The Apache Bugzilla tracker is avaiable at https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/

Regards,
Yegor Kozlov
