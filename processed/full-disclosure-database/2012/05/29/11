         CVE Name        CVE-2012-2947                                        

    Description  A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the     
                 IAX2 channel driver if an established call is placed on      
                 hold without a suggested music class. For this to occur,     
                 the following must take place:                               
                                                                              
                 1. The setting mohinterpret=passthrough must be set on the   
                 end placing the call on hold.                                
                                                                              
                 2. A call must be established.                               
                                                                              
                 3. The call is placed on hold without a suggested            
                 music-on-hold class name.                                    
                                                                              
                 When these conditions are true, Asterisk will attempt to     
                 use an invalid pointer to a music-on-hold class name. Use    
                 of the invalid pointer will either cause a crash or the      
                 music-on-hold class name will be garbage.                    

    Resolution  Asterisk now sets the extra data parameter to null if the     
                received control frame does not have any extra data.
