Package        : quagga
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0249 CVE-2012-0250 CVE-2012-0255

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga, a routing
daemon.

CVE-2012-0249
	A buffer overflow in the ospf_ls_upd_list_lsa function in the
	OSPFv2 implementation allows remote attackers to cause a
	denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a
	Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet that is smaller than
	the length specified in its header.

CVE-2012-0250
	A buffer overflow in the OSPFv2 implementation allows remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a
	Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet containing a
	network-LSA link-state advertisement for which the
	data-structure length is smaller than the value in the Length
	header field.

CVE-2012-0255
	The BGP implementation does not properly use message buffers
	for OPEN messages, which allows remote attackers impersonating
	a configured BGP peer to cause a denial of service (assertion
	failure and daemon exit) via a message associated with a
	malformed AS4 capability.

This security update upgrades the quagga package to the most recent
upstream release.  This release includes other corrections, such as
hardening against unknown BGP path attributes.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.20.1-0+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.20.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.
