OpenSSL Security Advisory [24 Apr 2012]
=======================================

ASN1 BIO incomplete fix (CVE-2012-2131)
=======================================

It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2012-2110 released on 19 Apr

already contain a patch sufficient to correct CVE-2012-2110.

Thanks to Red Hat for discovering and fixing this issue.

Affected users should upgrade to 0.9.8w.
