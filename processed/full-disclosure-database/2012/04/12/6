Package        : sqlalchemy
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0805

It was discovered that sqlalchemy, an SQL toolkit and object relational
mapper for python, is not sanitizing input passed to the limit/offset
keywords to select() as well as the value passed to select.limit()/offset().
This allows an attacker to perform SQL injection attacks against
applications using sqlalchemy that do not implement their own filtering.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.3-3+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.7-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your sqlalchemy packages.
