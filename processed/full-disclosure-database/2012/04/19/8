Subject: Incomplete protection of Oracle Database locked
 accounts (CVE-2012-0510)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

AppSecInc Team SHATTER Security Advisory

Incomplete protection of Oracle Database locked accounts.

Risk Level:
Low

Affected versions:
Oracle Database Server version 10gR1, 10gR2 (10.2.0.5 and previous
patchsets) and 11gR1 (11.1.0.7 and previous patchsets)


Remote exploitable:
Yes (No authentication is required)

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martinez
Fayo of Application Security Inc.

Details:
Oracle Database provides OCIPasswordChange API to change user passwords.
This API can be used while a user is logged on as well as before the
authentication process is completed, this is because it can be used for
accounts that have the password expired so that the user is able to
change an expired password for a new one.
It was observed that this API can be used to change the password of
users that are locked.  The purpose of locking an account is to
deactivate it once it has received too many failed logins attempts or
when no login is expected.  If it is allowed to change the password of a
locked account it is not correctly protecting it because brute force can
be applied on an account to change its password and eventually it will
get changed to a known password. The attacker will be able to log in
using the account only once it is unlocked.

Impact:
An unauthenticated attacker can perform on-line brute force of accounts
to change the password to a known value.  The attacker will be able to
log in using the account only once it is unlocked.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update April 2012 available at Oracle Support.

CVE:
CVE-2012-0510
