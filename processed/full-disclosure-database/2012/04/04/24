Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : integer overflow
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1173

Alexander Gavrun discovered an integer overflow in the TIFF library
in the parsing of the TileSize entry, which could result in the execution 
of arbitrary code if a malformed image is opened.

version 3.9.4-5+squeeze4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
