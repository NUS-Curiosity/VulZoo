ZDI-12-056 : Mozilla Firefox nsSVGValue Out-of-Bounds Access Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-056

April  9, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3658

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Mozilla



- -- Affected Products:

Mozilla Firefox



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox.  User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of nsSVGValue observers. A
certain method call can be made to loop excessively causing an
out-of-bounds memory access. By abusing this behavior an attacker can
ensure this memory is under control and leverage the situation to
achieve remote code execution under the context of the user running the
browser.

- -- Vendor Response:

Mozilla has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
