Subject: CVE-2012-0769, the case of the perfect info leak

Hi,

During the last few months I have been researching Adobe's Flash
vulnerabilities ranging from type confusion vulnerabilities, AS3 API
vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-0769), sandbox escapes (CVE-2012-0724 &
CVE-2012-0725), etc.

I am pleased to announce the release of part of this research. In this
case, the below linked document will focus on an already patched
(https://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb12-05.html)
vulnerability. "CVE-2012-0769, the case of the perfect info leak" goes
in detail from root cause analysis to a fully reliable, quick and
multi-platform exploitation of the vulnerability.
