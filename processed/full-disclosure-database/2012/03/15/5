- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists during handling of an error while loading
elements into an array. This condition can cause the driver to abort a
connection and part of the logic of the abort is to free an object
associated with it. This will actually occur twice when each of channels
are disconnected. The second time this object is freed, the driver will
fetch a virtual pointer from the freed object and call it. This can lead
to code execution under the context of the driver.

- -- Vendor Response:

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
