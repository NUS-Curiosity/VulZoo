Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 March 28 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

A vulnerability in the Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)
implementation of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could
allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a reload of an
affected device. Repeated attempts to exploit this vulnerability could
result in a sustained denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are
available. This advisory is available at the following link:

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120328-msdp


Note: The March 28, 2012, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled
publication includes nine Cisco Security Advisories. Each advisory
lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability
or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS
Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the March 2012
bundled publication.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following products are affected by this vulnerability:

      + Cisco IOS Software
      + Cisco IOS XE Software

To determine whether a Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software release is
running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device
and issue the "show version" command to display the system banner.
The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS
Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating
System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in
parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release
name. Other Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may
provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(20)T with an installed image name of
C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:

    Router#show version

    Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)

conventions is available in the White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS
Software Reference Guide

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability. No other
Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.

Details
=======

MSDP is the protocol used to connect multiple Protocol Independent
Multicast sparse mode (PIM-SM) domains. MSDP allows multicast sources
for a group to be known to all rendezvous points (RPs) in different
domains. An RP runs MSDP over TCP to discover multicast sources.

An RP in a PIM-SM domain has an MSDP peering relationship with
MSDP-enabled routers in another domain. The peering relationship occurs
over a TCP connection, where primarily a list of sources sending to
multicast groups is exchanged. The TCP connections between RPs are
achieved by the underlying routing system. The receiving RP uses the
source lists to establish a source path.

The purpose of this topology is to have domains discover multicast
sources in other domains. If the multicast sources are of interest to a
domain that has receivers, multicast data is delivered over the normal,
source-tree building mechanism in PIM-SM.

An MSDP packet containing encapsulated Internet Group Management
Protocol (IGMP) data, received from an external MSDP-configured peer
router, can cause an affected device to reload. This vulnerability can
only be exploited if the router is explicitly joined to the multicast
group. The MSDP packet destination address is a unicast address and
can be addressed to any IP address on the affected device, including
loopback addresses.

Transit traffic will not trigger this vulnerability.

A vulnerable interface configuration contains an explicitly joined
multicast group. Some example configurations that permit exploitation of
this vulnerability are:


!--- Interface configured for SAP Listener Support (a common
multicast group)


interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
ip pim sparse-mode
ip sap listen


!--- Interface configured to join a multicast group

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
ip pim sparse-mode
ip igmp join-group 224.2.127.254


You can also use the "show igmp interface" command to determine if an
interface is joined to a multicast group.

    RouterA#show ip igmp interface 
    GigabitEthernet0/0 is up, line protocol is up
      Internet address is 192.168.0.1/24
      IGMP is enabled on interface
      Current IGMP host version is 2
      Current IGMP router version is 2
      IGMP query interval is 60 seconds
      IGMP querier timeout is 120 seconds
      IGMP max query response time is 10 seconds
      Last member query count is 2
      Last member query response interval is 1000 ms
      Inbound IGMP access group is not set
      IGMP activity: 2 joins, 0 leaves
      Multicast routing is disabled on interface
      Multicast TTL threshold is 0
      Multicast groups joined by this system (number of users):
          224.2.127.254(2)  239.255.255.255(1)

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtr28857. This
vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
(CVE) ID CVE-2012-0382.

* Cisco Catalyst 3550 Series Switches support the Internet Key Exchange
(IKE) feature and are vulnerable to Cisco bug ID CSCts38429 when the
devices are running Layer 3 images; however, this product reached
the End of Software Maintenance milestone. Cisco 3550 Series SMI
Switches that are running Layer 2 images do not support IKE and are not
vulnerable. No other Cisco devices that run 12.2SE-based software are
vulnerable.

Bundled Publication.


Workarounds
===========

Customers with an MSDP-configured router who do not require membership
to multicast groups can remove the "ip sap listen" or "ip igmp
join-group <multicast-group address>" commands on the router interface
as a workaround.

For example:

  RouterA#conf t
    RouterA(config)# interface GigabitEthernet0/0
    RouterA(config-if)# no ip sap listen
    RouterA(config-if)# no ip igmp join-group 224.2.127.254


  interface GigabitEthernet0/0
  ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
  ip pim sparse-mode


To determine if a router is configured for MSDP peers, run the
command "show ip msdp peer" at the router command prompt:

    RouterA# show ip msdp peer
    MSDP Peer 192.168.0.2 (?), AS 100
      Connection status:
        State: Up, Resets: 0, Connection source: none configured
        Uptime(Downtime): 01:23:42, Messages sent/received: 25/24
        Output messages discarded: 0
        Connection and counters cleared 01:15:14 ago
      SA Filtering:
        Input (S,G) filter: none, route-map: none
        Input RP filter: none, route-map: none
        Output (S,G) filter: none, route-map: none
        Output RP filter: none, route-map: none
      SA-Requests:
        Input filter: none
      Peer ttl threshold: 0
      SAs learned from this peer: 0
        Input queue size: 0, Output queue size: 0
      Message counters:
        RPF Failure count: 0
        SA Messages in/out: 13/8
        SA Requests in: 0
        SA Responses out: 0   
        Data Packets in/out: 7/8

To remove an untrusted MSDP peer from your configuration, use the "no
ip msdp peer <address>" or "ip msdp default-peer <ip-address | name>"
command on the router configuration interface.

RouterA(config)# no ip msdp peer 192.168.0.2

    interface GigabitEthernet0/0
     ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
     ip pim sparse-mode
