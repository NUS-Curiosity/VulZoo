Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
Due to insufficient input validation within the software, an
unauthenticated attacker can escalate a critical SQL injection
vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands in the context of the
administrative super user ("root"). The flaw exists in the
my.activation.php3 script in the parameter "state".


Proof of concept:
-----------------
As the MySQL database runs as root with FILE privileges enabled, an
attacker can read/write arbitrary files on the target filesystem.

The following payload reads the first character of the /etc/passwd file
('r' for "root"):

state=%2527+and+
(case+when+SUBSTRING(LOAD_FILE(%2527/etc/passwd%2527),1,1)=char(114)+then+
BENCHMARK(40000000,ENCODE(%2527hello%2527,%2527batman%2527))+else+0+end)=0+--+

With MySQL's "into outfile" a simple PHP webshell can be deployed on the
vulnerable system.  Due to severe configuration issues in the
underlying Linux system an attacker can elevate his rights to "root" as
no password is set in the /etc/sudoers file. As a proof of concept the
password file /etc/shadow could be accessed. 

An exploit code exists but will not be made public.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerability has been verified to exist in the FirePass SSL VPN,
versions 6.0.0 - 6.1.0 and version 7.0.0, which was the most recent
version at the time of discovery.
