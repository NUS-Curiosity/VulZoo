Package        : openarena
Vulnerability  : UDP traffic amplification
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-5077
Debian Bug     : 665656

It has been discovered that spoofed "getstatus" UDP requests are being
sent by attackers to servers for use with games derived from the
Quake 3 engine (such as openarena).  These servers respond with a
packet flood to the victim whose IP address was impersonated by the
attackers, causing a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.5-5+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.8.5-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your openarena packages.
