Several vulnerabilities have been identified in Gnash, the GNU Flash
player.

CVE-2012-1175 

  Tielei Wang from Georgia Tech Information Security Center discovered a
  vulnerability in GNU Gnash which is caused due to an integer overflow
  error and can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by
  tricking a user into opening a specially crafted SWF file.

CVE-2011-4328

  Alexander Kurtz discovered an unsafe management of HTTP cookies. Cookie
  files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, vulnerability
  that allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files the users has
  write permissions for, and are also world-readable which may cause
  information leak.

CVE-2010-4337

  Jakub Wilk discovered an unsafe management of temporary files during the
  build process. Files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names,
  vulnerability that allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files
  the users has write permissions for.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.8-5+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnash packages.
