Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security
Appliance Clientless VPN ActiveX Control Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20120314-asaclient

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 March 14 16:00  UTC (GMT)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

The Cisco Clientless VPN solution as deployed by Cisco ASA 5500
Series Adaptive Security Appliances (Cisco ASA) uses an ActiveX
control on client systems to perform port forwarding operations.
Microsoft Windows-based systems that are running Internet Explorer or
another browser that supports Microsoft ActiveX technology may be
affected if the system has ever connected to a device that is running
the Cisco Clientless VPN solution. A remote, unauthenticated attacker
who could convince a user to connect to a malicious web page could
exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code on the affected machine
with the privileges of the web browser.

The affected ActiveX control is distributed to endpoint systems by
Cisco ASA.  However, the impact of successful exploitation of this
vulnerability is to the endpoint system only and does not compromise
Cisco ASA devices.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.

    |                                              |8.6             |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------+

    Note: Cisco ASA Software version 7.0 and 7.1 have reached end of
    software maintenance.  Customers who are using Cisco ASA Software
    version 7.0 or 7.1 should contact their Cisco support team for
    assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco ASA
    Software.

    Note: The affected implementation of the Cisco Clientless VPN
    solution was introduced with the release of Cisco ASA Software
    version 7.1.  This issue does not affect devices running Cisco
    PIX Software.


Administrators may determine whether the Cisco Clientless VPN solution
is enabled on their devices by issuing the "show running-config webvpn"
command. The following example shows the response when the Cisco
Clientless VPN solution is enabled:

    ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn
    webvpn
     enable outside

End user systems running Microsoft Windows may be affected if they
have used the Cisco Clientless VPN feature on an affected device from
a browser that supports ActiveX technology.  Devices that contain the
cscopf.ocx ActiveX control registered with a class ID (CLSID) of
{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232} are affected.  The affected
controls are marked both Safe for Scripting (SFS) and Safe for
Initialization (SFI), which may present additional attack vectors
when a system has registered and cached the affected control.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

  * Cisco Firewall Service Modules are not affected by this
    vulnerability
  * Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Services Modules are not
    affected by this vulnerability
  * Cisco IOS Software-based devices that use the Cisco Clientless
    VPN solution (WebVPN) are not affected by this vulnerability


No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) contain a feature known as
the Cisco Clientless VPN solution.  The Cisco Clientless VPN feature
allows users to use a web browser to create an SSL VPN tunnel from an
endpoint device to a Cisco ASA device.  When connected, the ASA
pushes several ActiveX and Java applications to the endpoint device
to allow a number of features to operate.

When a browser that supports Microsoft ActiveX technology is used to
create the Clientless VPN tunnel, the Cisco Port Forwarder ActiveX
control may be sent to the endpoint system on which the browser is
running.  This control contains an exploitable buffer overflow
vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
who can convince a user to visit a malicious website to execute
attacker-controlled arbitrary code on the endpoint device.  The
attacker-supplied code would be executed with the privileges of the
user who invoked the browser used to visit the attacker-controlled
website.  If the user has administrative privileges, a complete
compromise may occur.

Upgrading a Cisco ASA device to a version of software that contains
the fixed control will not remediate the issue on endpoint systems
that have downloaded the affected control.  Affected endpoint systems
will need to disable the control via one of the methods suggested in
the "Workarounds" section of this document.  Endpoint systems may
also connect to a Cisco ASA device that is running a version of
software that contains the fixed control via the Cisco Clientless VPN
solution to update the control to an unaffected version.

When loaded on an endpoint system, the affected control has a binary
name of cscopf.ocx and is registered on a system with a CLSID of
{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}.  Fixed versions of the
cscopf.ocx control are registered with CLSID
{C861B75F-EE32-4aa4-B610-281AF26A8D1C}.

Cisco is requesting that Microsoft set a global kill bit for this
control in a future Microsoft kill-bit update. After this update
occurs, the affected control will stop operating on all affected
endpoint systems that load the Microsoft-provided update.

This advisory addresses the vulnerability in the Cisco Port Forwarder
ActiveX control provided by Cisco ASA when the Cisco Clientless VPN
feature is used. This issue is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtr00165
and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
CVE-2012-0358.

    Note: Cisco ASA Software version 7.0 and 7.1 have reached end of
    software maintenance. Customers who are using Cisco ASA Software
    version 7.0 or 7.1 should contact their Cisco support team for
    assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco ASA
    Software.

    Note: The recommended releases contain the fixes for all
    vulnerabilities for all the advisories published in the
    publication. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release that is
    equal to or later than these recommended releases.

    Note: Upgrading a Cisco ASA device to a version of software that
    contains the fixed version of the Cisco Port Forwarder ActiveX
    control does not remove the vulnerability on affected endpoint
    systems.  Affected endpoint systems will need to download the
    fixed version by connecting to a Cisco ASA device that is running
    fixed software via the Cisco Clientless Web solution or disable
    the affected control via one of the methods mentioned in the
    "Workarounds" section of this document.


Workarounds
===========

End users or administrators may mitigate Internet Explorer as an
attack vector by setting the kill bit for the affected ActiveX
control.  This can be achieved by modifying the registry either
directly on the affected machine or via an Active Directory Group
Policy. 

Warning: Incorrectly modifying the system registry of a Microsoft
Windows-based device may cause serious problems.  Neither Cisco nor
Microsoft can guarantee that you can resolve problems that may result
from improper registry modification from either applying the registry
changes via a .reg file or by using the Registry Editor incorrectly. 
Modify the registry of your system at your own risk.

To set the kill bit for the CLSID with a value of
{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}, paste the following text in a
text editor such as Notepad.  Save the file using the .reg filename
extension.

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}]
    "Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{B8E73359-3422-4384-8D27-4EA1B4C01232}]
    "Compatibility Flags"=dword:04000400

End users can apply this .reg file to individual systems by
double-clicking the file.  Administrators can also apply the registry
change across domains by using Group Policy.  You can find more
information about using Group Policy in the following Microsoft
TechNet article: Group Policy Collection

When the registry change has been applied, Microsoft Internet
Explorer must be restarted for the changes to take effect.  Once the
kill bit has been set, the affected control will no longer be
accessible by the Cisco Clientless VPN system or a malicious web page
when accessed by Internet Explorer.  This change may impact some
clientless installations that use the Cisco Port Forwarder ActiveX
control. One common component that may stop operating is the ActiveX
RDP plug-in.

Mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in a network are
