Hi Alexander,

As a researcher, I find the distros list a useful resource to enable quick and
simultaneous notification of many open source OS distributions.

I think this is a good idea.  I likely misunderstood the process you want
researchers to follow when it comes to using the distros list.  While I think
the time to release for this issue was excessive, I should have nailed down a
release date with the upstreams prior to notifying the distros list.


I'll reserve some additional comments for the oss-security list exclusively.

Thanks,
tim
