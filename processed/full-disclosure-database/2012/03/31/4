Package        : curl
Vulnerability  : regression
Debian-specific: no
Debian Bug     : 658276

cURL is a command-line tool and library for transferring data with URL
syntax.  It was discovered that the countermeasures against the
Dai/Rogaway chosen-plaintext attack on SSL/TLS (CVE-2011-3389,
"BEAST") cause interoperability issues with some server
implementations.  This update ads the the CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS and
CURLSSLOPT_ALLOW_BEAST options to the library, and the
- --ssl-allow-beast option to the "curl" program.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze2.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
