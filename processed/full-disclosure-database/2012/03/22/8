Package        : libpng
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3045

Glenn-Randers Pehrson discovered an buffer overflow in the libpng PNG 
library, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if a 
malformed image is processed.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.44-1+squeeze3. Packages for i386 are not yet available,
but will be provided shortly.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.
