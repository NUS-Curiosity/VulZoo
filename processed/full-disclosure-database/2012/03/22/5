CVE-2012-0037: OpenOffice.org data leakage vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: OpenOffice.org 3.3 and 3.4 Beta, on all platforms.
Earlier versions may be also affected.

Description: An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is possible in the
above versions of OpenOffice.org.  This vulnerability exploits the way
in
which external entities are processed in certain XML components of ODF
documents.  By crafting an external entity to refer to other local
file system
resources, an attacker would be able to inject contents of other
locally- accessible files into the ODF document, without the user's
knowledge or permission.  Data leakage then becomes possible when that
document is later distributed to other parties.

Mitigation: OpenOffice.org 3.3.0 and 3.4 beta users should install the
patch at:  http://www.openoffice.org/security/cves/CVE-2012-0037.html

This vulnerability is also fixed in Apache OpenOffice 3.4 dev
snapshots since March 1st, 2012.

Source and Building: Information on obtaining the source code for this
patch, and for porting it or adapting it to OpenOffice.org derivatives
