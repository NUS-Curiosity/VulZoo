Package        : bogofilter
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-5468
Debian Bug     : 695139

A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in bogofilter, a software
package for classifying mail messages as spam or non-spam.  Crafted
mail messages with invalid base64 data could lead to heap corruption
and, potentially, arbitrary code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.2.2+dfsg1-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your bogofilter packages.
