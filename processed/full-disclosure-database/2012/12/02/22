So normally for MySQL issues Oracle would assign the CVE #. However in
this case we have a bit of a time constraint (it's a weekend and this
is blowing up quickly)  and the impacts are potentially quite severe.
So I've spoken with some other Red Hat SRT members and we feel it is
best to get CVE #'s assigned for these issues quickly so we can refer
to them properly.

If Oracle security has already assigned CVE's for these please let us
and the public know so we can use the correct numbers. Also if Oracle
can let the public know which versions of MySQL are affected (e.g.
5.0.x, 5.1.x, 5.5.x, etc.) that would be very helpful to everyone I am
sure.

I am also adding MySQL, Oracle, MariaDB, OSS-SEC, Steven Christey,
cve-assign and OSVDB to the CC so that everyone is aware of what is
going on.

Sorry forgot the CVE the first time:

Please use CVE-2012-5611 for MySQL (Linux) Stack based buffer overrun
PoC Zeroday
