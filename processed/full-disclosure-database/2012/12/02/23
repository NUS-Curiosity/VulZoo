 buffer overrun PoC Zeroday

Hi, Kurt!

This is CVE-2012-5579 that we've been discussing recently.
A test case it different, but it triggers exactly the same code.

MariaDB is not vulnerable as of 5.1.66, 5.2.13, 5.3.11, 5.5.28a.
Latest released MySQL versions are still affected, but Oracle knows
about this issue, so next versions won't be.

Regards,
Sergei
MariaDB Security Coordinator
