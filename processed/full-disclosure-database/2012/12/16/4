Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4201 CVE-2012-4207 CVE-2012-4216 CVE-2012-5829 
                 CVE-2012-5842

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client.

CVE-2012-4201
  The evalInSandbox implementation uses an incorrect context during
  the handling of JavaScript code that sets the location.href
  property, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks or read arbitrary files by leveraging a
  sandboxed add-on.

CVE-2012-4207
  The HZ-GB-2312 character-set implementation does not properly handle
  a ~ (tilde) character in proximity to a chunk delimiter, which
  allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks via a crafted document.

CVE-2012-4216
  Use-after-free vulnerability in the gfxFont::GetFontEntry function
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
  of service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.

CVE-2012-5829
  Heap-based buffer overflow in the nsWindow::OnExposeEvent function could
  allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-5842
  Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine could
  allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
  corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
  code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze15.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.11-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
