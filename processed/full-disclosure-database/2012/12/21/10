ZDI-12-189 : Oracle Java WebStart Changing System Properties Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-189
December 21, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-1721

- -- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

- -- Affected Products:
Oracle Java Runtime


- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page
or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists because it is possible to change system properties
through trusted JNLP files. If a JNLP file requests "<all-permissions/>"
and only references signed, trusted JAR files, it can set all System
properties. By referencing a trusted JNLP file from an untrusted one it is
possible to change System Properties that can lead to remote code execution
under the context of the current user.


- -- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
