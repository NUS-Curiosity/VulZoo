- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Internet Explorer handles repeated
calls to insertAdjacentText. When the size of the element reaches a certain
threshold Internet Explorer fails to correctly relocate key elements. An
unitialized variable in one of the function can cause memory corruption.
This can lead to remote code execution under the context of the program.

- -- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
