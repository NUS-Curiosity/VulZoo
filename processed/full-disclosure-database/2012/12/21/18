ZDI-12-197 : Oracle Java java.beans.Statement Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-197
December 21, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-1682

- -- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:
Oracle

- -- Affected Products:
Oracle Java Runtime

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page
or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the java.beans.Expression class. Due to
unsafe handling of reflection of privileged classes inside the Expression
class it is possible for untrusted code to gain access to privileged
methods and properties. This can result in remote code execution under the
context of the current process.

- -- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
