- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists when the application attempts to decode an audio
sample that is encoded with the ATRAC codec. While parsing sample data, the
application will explicitly trust 2-bits as a loop counter which can be
used to write outside the bounds of the target buffer. This can lead to
code execution under the context of the application.

- -- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
