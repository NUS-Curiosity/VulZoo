- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists in the 'onpropertychange' user callback function
for the document.title. If the function changes the document in the
callback function by using, for example, a document.write call, this can
result in a use-after-free vulnerability. This can lead to remote code
execution under the context of the program.

- -- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
