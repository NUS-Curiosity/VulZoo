- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Internet Explorer handles the
onbeforedeactivate callback function for certain elements. During the
execution of the onbeforedeactivate callback function it is possible to
alter the DOM tree of the page which can lead to a use-after-free
vulnerability when the function returns. This can result in remote code
execution under the context of the current process.
