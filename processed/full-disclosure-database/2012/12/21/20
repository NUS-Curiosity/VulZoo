- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Internet Explorer handles CTreeNode
objects. By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can force a
dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. The issue lies in a
possible type confusion between a CTreeNode object and an ISpanQualifier
instance during the layout of a document being performed. An attacker can
leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the
current process.

- -- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
