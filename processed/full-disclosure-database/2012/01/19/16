	Service

Thanks again for re-enforcing my paranoia with another one of your exploits.
The apache killer one was particularly disturbing and at the same time,
another great eye-opener, much respect to you.

I tested this on a custom compiled kernel for PXE booting, version
2.6.37.6-x86_64, running Debian Squeeze, and I can't seem to get it to work.
Root is mounted read-only over NFS.

I don't recall any special config options I did for networking or IGMP
requests, other then building my NIC drivers and NFS into the kernel.
Did I just get lucky?

Thanks,

Morgus
