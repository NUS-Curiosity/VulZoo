Hello xD,
sorry I don't understand a word you are talking about.
To put everything together about what you were ranting would take too

Did I offend you in any way ?
It's just a PoC for people to test their systems nothing else...
I cannot check each every system if it works, I just checked two boxes
and thats enough for me.

Regards,

Kc
