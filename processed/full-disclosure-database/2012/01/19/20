Try fixing the in_cksum() function, it has been intionally
crippled,also,look at both of the 'ips' both should really be argvs,as
theyre set in saddr/daddr;)
this should be easy to fix, or read the pasted one i think is in one
of my posts in reply to it, it will show where i had to adjust it, as
the sendto, will never work with the in_cksum not functional, lan, or
no lan...
anyhow, you could ignore me, but in the end, read the code... later dude.
