Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1938 CVE-2011-2483 CVE-2011-4566 CVE-2011-4885 
                 CVE-2012-0057 

A regression was found in the fix for PHP's XSLT transformations
(CVE-2012-0057). Updated packages are now available to address this
regression. For reference, the original advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, the web scripting
language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:

CVE-2011-1938

  The UNIX socket handling allowed attackers to trigger a buffer overflow
  via a long path name.

CVE-2011-2483

  The crypt_blowfish function did not properly handle 8-bit characters,
  which made it easier for attackers to determine a cleartext password
  by using knowledge of a password hash.

CVE-2011-4566

  When used on 32 bit platforms, the exif extension could be used to
  trigger an integer overflow in the exif_process_IFD_TAG function
  when processing a JPEG file.

CVE-2011-4885

  It was possible to trigger hash collisions predictably when parsing
  form parameters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service by sending many crafted parameters.

CVE-2012-0057

  When applying a crafted XSLT transform, an attacker could write files
  to arbitrary places in the filesystem.

NOTE: the fix for CVE-2011-2483 required changing the behaviour of this
function: it is now incompatible with some old (wrongly) generated hashes
for passwords containing 8-bit characters. See the package NEWS entry
for details. This change has not been applied to the Lenny version of PHP.

NOTE: at the time of release packages for some architectures are still
being built. They will be installed into the archive as soon as they
arrive.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny15.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.3.3-7+squeeze6.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 5.3.9-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
