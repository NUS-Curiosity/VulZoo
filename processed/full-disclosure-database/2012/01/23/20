Synopsis
========

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw in FontForge could result in
execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

FontForge is a PostScript font editor and converter.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/fontforge       < 20110222-r1           >= 20110222-r1

Description
===========

FontForge is vulnerable to an error when processing the
"CHARSET_REGISTRY" header in font files, which could cause a
stack-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted BDF
file using FontForge font editor, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the FontForge
process, or a Denial of Service (application crash).

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All FontForge users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=media-gfx/fontforge-20110222-r1"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since October 12, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
