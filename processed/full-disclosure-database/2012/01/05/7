ZDI-12-005 : Apple Quicktime RLE BGRA Decoding Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-005
January  5, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3248

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Apple



- -- Affected Products:

Apple Quicktime



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application decodes video
samples encoded with the RLE codec. When decompressing the sample, the
application will fail to accommodate for the canvas the sample is
rendered into. This can cause a buffer overflow and thus can be taken
advantage of in order to gain code execution under the context of the
application.

- -- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
