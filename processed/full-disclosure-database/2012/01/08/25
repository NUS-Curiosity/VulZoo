Package        : super
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2776 

Robert Luberda discovered a buffer overflow in the syslog logging code of 
Super, a tool to execute scripts (or other commands) as if they were root.
The default Debian configuration is not affected.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.30.0-2+lenny1. Due to a technical limitation in the Debian
archive scripts this update cannot be released synchronously with the
stable update. It will be available shortly.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.30.0-3+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your super packages.
