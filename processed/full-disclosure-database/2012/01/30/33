- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM SPSS. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the SaveDoc and PrintFile functions
exposed by the VsVIEW6.ocx ActiveX control. The SaveDoc function causes
a file to be created at an arbitrary path specified by the first
argument (FileName). The file contents can be controlled by setting the
'Header' member and calling PrintFile() with the same path argument.
These behaviors can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code on the target system.

- -- Vendor Response:

IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
