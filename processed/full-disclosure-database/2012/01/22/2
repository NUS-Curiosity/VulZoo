Subject: Linux Local Root -- CVE-2012-0056 -- Detailed
	Write-up

Hey Everyone,

I did a detailed write-up on exploitingÂ CVE-2012-0056 that some of
y'all might appreciate. Pretty fun bug to play with -- dup2ing all
over the place for the prize of getting to write arbitrary process
memory into su :-).

The write up is available on my blog here: http://blog.zx2c4.com/749 . Enjoy.

Jason
