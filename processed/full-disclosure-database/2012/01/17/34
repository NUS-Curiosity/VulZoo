Best comeback i think i have seen on FD :)
thx for the morning laff,

also people dont realise that this is possible that this was only a
'poc' and not a really hardcore working d0s, but, you would probably
only need to modify optarg and possibly look at the igmp v3 packet
abit closer, better yet, look back to the bugs in the icmp stack, and
there was the same bugs in those years but they would cause the
machine to be rendered unuseable.
I suspect that this is only a 'snippet' of the reeel deal ;)
cheers kope, see you online in 5minutes!
