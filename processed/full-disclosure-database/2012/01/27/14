Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities have been found in ktsuss, allowing local attackers
to gain escalated privileges.

Background
==========

ktsuss is a simple, graphical version of su written in C and GTK+.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  x11-misc/ktsuss               <= 1.4                  Vulnerable!
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     NOTE: Certain packages are still vulnerable. Users should migrate
           to another package if one is available or wait for the
           existing packages to be marked stable by their
           architecture maintainers.

Description
===========

Two vulnerabilities have been found in ktuss:

* Under specific circumstances, ktsuss skips authentication and fails
  to change the effective UID back to the real UID (CVE-2011-2921).
* The GTK interface spawned by the ktsuss binary is run as root
  (CVE-2011-2922).

Impact
======

A local attacker could gain escalated privileges and use the
"GTK_MODULES" environment variable to possibly execute arbitrary code
with root privileges.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

Gentoo discontinued support for ktsuss. We recommend that users unmerge
ktsuss:

  # emerge --unmerge "x11-misc/ktsuss"
