ZDI-12-016 : (0Day) HP Diagnostics Server magentservice.exe Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-016
January 12, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-4789

- -- CVSS:
10, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:

Hewlett-Packard



- -- Affected Products:

Hewlett-Packard Diagnostics Server



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Diagnostics server. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the way the HP Diagnostics server
handles incomming packets with 0x00000000 as the first 32-bit value. The
magentservice.exe process listens on port 23472 by default. It will
eventually take that first dword, decrease it by one and use it as a
size value to copy data into a stack buffer. The resulting stack-based
buffer overflow can result in remote code execution under the system user.

- -- Vendor Response:



- -- Mitigation:
HP states that a patch for this vulnerability will be made available to
the public "soon." Until that time, it is recommended that
administrators of Diagnostics Server enabled systems restrict access to
port 23472 to trusted hosts only.
