====================================================================== 
1) Affected Software 

* NTR ActiveX Control version 1.1.8.

NOTE: Other versions may also be affected.

====================================================================== 
2) Severity 

Rating: Highly critical
Impact: System compromise
Where:  Remote

====================================================================== 
3) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered four vulnerabilities in NTR ActiveX 
control, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

1) A boundary error in the handling of the "StartModule()" method can 
be exploited to cause a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long
"bstrUrl" parameter.

2) A boundary error when constructing an url can be exploited to cause 
a stack-based buffer overflow via e.g. an overly long, specially 
crafted "bstrParams" parameter passed to the "Check()" method.

3) A boundary error when constructing the path to a .ntr file can be 
exploited to cause a limited stack-based buffer overflow via an overly 
long, specially crafted "bstrUrl" parameter passed to the "Download()" 
or "DownloadModule()" methods.

4) A boundary error when constructing an url can be exploited to cause 
a stack-based buffer overflow via an overly long, specially crafted 
"bstrUrl" parameter passed to the "Download()" or "DownloadModule()" 
methods.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities allows execution of 
arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
4) Solution 

Upgrade to version 2.0.4.8.
