Package        : ffmpeg
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4351 CVE-2011-4353 CVE-2011-4364 CVE-2011-4579 

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in ffmpeg, a multimedia 
player, server and encoder. Multiple input validations in the decoders
for QDM2, VP5, VP6, VMD and SVQ1 files could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.5.6-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.7.3-1 of the libav source package.

We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.
