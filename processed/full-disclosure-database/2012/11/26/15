http://(NACIP)/assets/login?a=http://www.evil.com

 

Forescout NAC 6.3.4.1 Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability (CVE-2012-4983)

 

The Forescout NAC device is vulnerable to two cross-site scripting issues
and could be used to redirect a targetted victim to a malicious site or gain
access to the NAC admin console. The 'a' parameter is vulnerable on the
'login' page and the search page 'rangesearch' is vulnerable to
authenticated users. See below for details: 

 

Login page:

http://(NACIP)/assets/login?a=asdf" onload="alert(123)">

 

Search field (needs authenticated user):

http://(NACIP)/assets/rangesearch?fromIndex=0&query=asdf"
onclick="alert(123)"&main_selection=all

 

 

Forescout NAC ICMP and ARP Protocols Not Filtered Vulnerability Advisory
(CVE-2012-4985)

 

Forescout NAC (Network Access Control) device is vulnerable to ICMP and ARP
protocol filter bypass. The NAC does not filter traffic from unknown clients
over these protocols. An attacker with an unauthorised device can engage ARP
poisoning attacks and potentially gain access to cleartext login credentials
traversing the network (where cleartext protocols are employed). The
attacker could then use these credentials via an authorised
terminal/workstation to gain full access to the network.
