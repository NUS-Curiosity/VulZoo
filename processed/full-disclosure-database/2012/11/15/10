- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Excel. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within Excel's parsing of Feature11/Feature12
records. The process trusts a supplied counter value without validating its
size and proceeds to use it within a copy operation to the stack. An
attacker can abuse this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the
user running Excel.

- -- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
