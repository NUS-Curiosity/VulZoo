Subject: Re: [oss-security] Re: [OVSA20121112] OpenVAS
 Manager Vulnerable To Command Injection

Hello Tim,

  thank you for the heads up and notification.

The versions of openvas-manager package, as shipped with Fedora release of 16
and release of 17 is based on upstream 2.0.5 version yet. From what I have looked
and can tell from upstream advisory and patch (for 3.0.X version):
[1] http://www.openvas.org/OVSA20121112.html
[2] http://wald.intevation.org/scm/viewvc.php?view=rev&root=openvas&revision=14437

the CVE-2012-5520 does not seem to be applicable to OpenVAS-4 / openvas-manager 2.0.5
version yet:
[3] http://lists.wald.intevation.org/pipermail/openvas-announce/2012-August/000140.html

But prior definitely classifying Fedora 16 and Fedora 17 openvas-manager package versions
as not vulnerable to this issue, I would like to hear opinion / confirmation from someone
more familiar with OpenVAS code.

So could you confirm the CVE-2012-5520 wouldn't affect OpenVAS-4 2.0.X version (yet)?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

Doh, a document gets proof read by multiple people and yet it contains a 
mistake.  In the Current Status section of the advisory, the date is 
incorrect.  A corrected advisory is attached.
