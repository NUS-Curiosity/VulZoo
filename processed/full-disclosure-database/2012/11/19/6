Package        : tiff
Vulnerability  : heap-based buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4564

It was discovered that ppm2tiff of the tiff tools, a set of utilities
for TIFF manipulation and conversion, is not properly checking the return
value of an internal function used in order to detect integer overflows.
As a consequence, ppm2tiff suffers of a heap-based buffer overflow.
This allows attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code via a crafted
ppm image, especially in scenarios in which images are automatically
processed.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze7.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.2-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
