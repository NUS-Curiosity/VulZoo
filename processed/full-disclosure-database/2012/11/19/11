ZDI-12-187 : RealNetworks RealPlayer RV20 Frame Size Array Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-187
November 19, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0923

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:
RealNetworks

- -- Affected Products:
RealNetworks RealPlayer

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses a particular
array contained within a Real Media file and then uses the data. When
allocating and reading frame size information, the application will fail to
check the bounds of how this array is used. The application will use
results in this array as an allocation for the size of a buffer. When
initializing this new buffer, the application can then write outside it's
bounds which will lead to code execution under the context of the
application.

- -- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
