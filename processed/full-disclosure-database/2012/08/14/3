Subject: Group-Office Cleartext Credentials Stored in
	Cookies

/------------------------------------------------------\
| Group-Office Cleartext Credentials Stored in Cookies |
\------------------------------------------------------/


Summary
=======

Group-Office 4.0.71 was found to display a behaviour that could potentially
expose a user's username and cleartext password to third-parties. Under
certain circumstances the application would return two cookies, one
containing the user's username and the other their cleartext password. These
cookies would then be returned to the server with each request to the
application.

CVE number: CVE-2012-4239
Impact: Medium

Affected Products
======== ========

Confirmed in Group-Office community 4.0.71. Other versions may also be
affected.


Details
=======

When logging into the application, if a user ticks the 'Remember my login on
this computer until I press logout' box, and then successfully logs into the
application, two cookies ('GO_UN' and 'GO_PW') are returned. These cookies
contain the user's username and cleartext password respectively.

The cookies are set with the 'HttpOnly' flag which would significantly
reduce the chances of their disclosure during a cross-site scripting attack.
However, the application does not enforce a secure channel by default, and
the offending cookies are not set with the 'Secure' flag.


Impact
======

Once these cookies are stored, the user's username and password could be
transferred over an insecure HTTP connection, increasing the liklihood that
an attacker might be able to intercept the credentials and access the
application.

Furthermore, the cleartext credentials will be stored on the computer which
makes them more easily accessible to an attacker with access to the machine.
This significantly lowers the difficulty of exploitation.


Solution
========

Upgrade to Group-Office community 4.0.73.
