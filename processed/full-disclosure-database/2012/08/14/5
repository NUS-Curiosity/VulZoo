| Total Shop UK eCommerce Generic Cross-Site Scripting |
\------------------------------------------------------/


Summary
=======

The open source version of Total Shop UK eCommerce based on CodeIgniter
version 2.1.2 is subject to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The value
of a generic parameter was not sufficiently sanitised before being written
to a block of Javascript code. An attacker could distribute a malicious URL
that would trigger this vulnerability and potentially steal session cookies,
redirect the user to a malicious URL or download malware onto their machine.

CVE number: CVE-2012-4236

Affected Products
======== ========

Total Shop UK eCommerce based on CodeIgniter version 2.1.2 (open source
version). Other versions may be affected.


Details
=======

Generic parameters in the /application/modules/_main/views/_top.php file are
written to a Javascript function in the page header without sanitisation.
The entire URL, including the query string, is written (via a PHP echo
construct) into a refresh_page() Javascript function. It was possible to
escape the function and execute arbitrary Javascript code on the application
pages. 

There is some character filtering in place, although this can be evaded by
inserting a null (%00) character (see proof of concept).


Impact
======

An attacker might entice users to follow a malicious URL, causing Javascript
code to execute in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies,
redirecting the user to a malicious URL or downloading malware onto their
machine.


Proof of Concept
===== == =======

Injecting the following Javascript code into a generic parameter on any
application page will trigger the vulnerability, causing the page to return
a Javascript alert box.

%00";};alert(String.fromCharCode(120,115,115,116,101,115,116));{//

Example 1 Request:
+-----------------

GET /?%00";};alert(String.fromCharCode(120,115,115,116,101,115,116));{//=1
HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.6
Referer: http://192.168.0.6/about

Example 1 Response:
+------------------

--- SNIP ---
function refresh_page(){
 
parent.location="/?%00";};alert(String.fromCharCode(120,115,115,116,101,115,
116));{//=1"; 
}
--- SNIP ---
