Subject: NeoInvoice Blind SQL Injection (CVE-2012-3477)

NeoInvoice is a multi-tenant open source invoicing system, that
currently contains an unauthenticated blind SQL injection condition in
signup_check.php. The input for the value field isn't being properly
sanitized, and is used in string concatenation to create the SQL
query.

See here for the offending code:

https://github.com/tlhunter/neoinvoice/blob/5e7af94641cba17df9141e95108c369cfb6e6dd5/public/signup_check.php#L29

Proof of concept:

signup_check.php?field=username&value='+OR+SLEEP(5)+OR+'

I've alerted the author but haven't heard back.
