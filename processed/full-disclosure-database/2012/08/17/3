 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2012:137
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : acpid
 Date    : August 17, 2012
 Affected: 2011.
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in acpid:
 
 Oliver-Tobias Ripka discovered that an ACPI script incorrectly handled
 power button events. A local attacker could use this to execute
 arbitrary code, and possibly escalate privileges (CVE-2011-2777).
 
 Helmut Grohne and Michael Biebl discovered that ACPI scripts were
 executed with a permissive file mode creation mask (umask). A local
 attacker could read files and modify directories created by ACPI
 scripts that did not set a strict umask (CVE-2011-4578).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
