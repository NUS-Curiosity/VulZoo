ZDI-12-141 : Microsoft .NET Framework Clipboard Unsafe Memory Access Remote
Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-141
August 17, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-1855

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

- -- Affected Products:
Microsoft .NET

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the .NET Framework. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within Microsoft .NET XAML Browser Application (XBAP)
handling of Clipboard object data. It is possible to cause unsafe memory
access within System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard, allowing an attacker to
control the memory used by an object's native code. This unsafe access
allows for control of a function pointer, which can be exploited to
remotely execute code. In the case of Internet Explorer, execution of
attacker code occurs outside of the Protected Mode sandbox. 

- -- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
