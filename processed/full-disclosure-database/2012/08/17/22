ZDI-12-143 : Microsoft Visio DWGDP MTEXT Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-143
August 17, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-1888

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

- -- Affected Products:
Microsoft Office

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Visio. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within DWGDP.DLL, which is responsible for parsing
DXF files. When processing MTEXT strings in the ENTITIES section of the DXF
file, certain characters are sought after to end the string copy function.
If these characters are not found, the copy function will continue to copy
data outside of the stack buffer, causing memory corruption. An attacker
can utilize this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the
program.

- -- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
