Package        : postgresql-8.4
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3488 CVE-2012-3489

Two vulnerabilities related to XML processing were discovered in
PostgreSQL, an SQL database.

CVE-2012-3488
	contrib/xml2's xslt_process() can be used to read and write
	external files and URLs.

CVE-2012-3489
	xml_parse() fetches external files or URLs to resolve DTD and
	entity references in XML values.

This update removes the problematic functionality, potentially
breaking applications which use it in a legitimate way.

Due to the natural of these vulnerabilities, it is possible that
attackers who have only indirect address to the database can supply
crafted XML data which exploits this vulnerability.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 8.4.13-0squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1.5-1 of the postgresql-9.1 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.4 packages.
