ZDI-12-079 : Apple QuickTime H264 Picture Width Parsing Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-079
June  6, 2012

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2012-0665

- -- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

Apple

- -- Affected Products:

Apple QuickTime



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the QuicktimeH264 modules in the QuickTime
player that handles H264 encoded movies. When the value for
'pic_width_in_mbs_minus_1' and 'pic_height_in_map_units_minus_1' in the
AVCC header data differs from the actual picture width and height a heap
buffer overflow occurs. This can result in remote code execution under the
context of the current process.


- -- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
be found at:
