ZDI-12-085 : RealNetworks RealPlayer dmp4 esds Width Remote Code Execution
Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-085
June  6, 2012

- -- CVE ID:

CVE-2011-4261

- -- CVSS:

7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Vendors:

RealNetworks

- -- Affected Products:

RealNetworks RealPlayer

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the dmp4 component. If the width value is
altered inside the esds atom, arithmetic instructions within RealPlayer
code can result in a loop counter wrapping to a large value. This can cause
the loop to run too many times while operating on heap memory. By
exploiting this condition, an attacker can corrupt memory and leverage that
to execute code under the context of the user running the application.

- -- Vendor Response:

RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
