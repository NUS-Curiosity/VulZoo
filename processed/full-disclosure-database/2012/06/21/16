- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Data Protector Express. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the dpwinsdr.exe process which listens on
TCP port 3817 by default. The process has insufficient bounds checking on
user-supplied data copied to a fixed-length buffer on the stack. Remote,
unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending
malformed opcode 0x320 message packets to the target, which could
ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM
user.

- -- Vendor Response:

Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
