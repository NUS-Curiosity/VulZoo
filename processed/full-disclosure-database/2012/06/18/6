Subject: DC4420 - London DEFCON - June meet - Tuesday June
	19th 2012

As I'm sure you've all now recovered from celebrating with The Queen, 
it's time to crack open your wallets and come and celebrate the arrival 
of the other week's worth of decent weather that we call the British 
summer and have a drink with us!

This month we have a proper tekky talk on the very topical subject of "A 
brief analysis of CVE-2012-2122"

   Synopsis: "A code analysis of the recently revealed MySQL 
authentication bypass"

   Presenter Bio: "A UK based penetration tester and community 
contributor. Techncial Director of Encription Limited, a UK and European 
penetration testing, training and forensics company. Director and member 
of the Technical Panel for Tigerscheme."

I promise their research is better than their spelling, and we may have 
a fun talk as well, which is yet to be confirmed...
