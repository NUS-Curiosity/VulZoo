 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2012:094
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : clamav
 Date    : June 18, 2012
 Affected: Enterprise Server 5.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 This is a bugfix release that upgrades clamav to the latest version
 (0.97.5) that resolves the following security issues:
 
 The TAR file parser in ClamAV 0.96.4 allows remote attackers to bypass
 malware detection via a TAR archive entry with a length field that
 exceeds the total TAR file size. NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into
 multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the
 error occurred independently in different TAR parser implementations
 (CVE-2012-1457).
 
 The Microsoft CHM file parser in ClamAV 0.96.4 allows remote attackers
 to bypass malware detection via a crafted reset interval in the LZXC
 header of a CHM file. NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs
 if additional information is published showing that the error occurred
 independently in different CHM parser implementations (CVE-2012-1458).
 
 The TAR file parser in ClamAV 0.96.4 allows remote attackers to
 bypass malware detection via a TAR archive entry with a length field
 corresponding to that entire entry, plus part of the header of the
 next entry. NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if
 additional information is published showing that the error occurred
 independently in different TAR parser implementations (CVE-2012-1459).
