- - -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of QuickTime Player. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw occurs when parsing a movie file containing multiple
atoms with a different string length. When resizing a buffer in order to
make space for the string, the application will forget to include the
null-terminator. When the application attempts to null-terminate the
string, an out-of-bounds write will occur. If an aggressor can place the a
useful heap buffer contiguous to the reallocated string, this can lead to
code execution under the context of the application.

- - -- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
