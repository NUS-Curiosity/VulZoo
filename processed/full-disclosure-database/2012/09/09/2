Package        : qemu-kvm
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-2652 CVE-2012-3515

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2012-2652:

    The snapshot mode of Qemu (-snapshot) incorrectly handles temporary
    files used to store the current state, making it vulnerable to
    symlink attacks (including arbitrary file overwriting and guest
    information disclosure) due to a race condition.

CVE-2012-3515:

    Qemu does not properly handle VT100 escape sequences when emulating
    certain devices with a virtual console backend. An attacker within a
    guest with access to the vulnerable virtual console could overwrite
    memory of Qemu and escalate privileges to that of the qemu process.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze9.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will been fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.
