AppSecInc Team SHATTER Security Advisory

Multiple SQL Injection in Oracle Enterprise Manager (SQL Tunning Sets
components).

Risk Level:
High

Affected versions:
Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Control 11.1.0.7, 11.2.0.3 (and
previous patchsets)

Remote exploitable:
Yes

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martinez
Fayo of Application Security Inc.

Details:
SQL Injection works by attempting to modify the parameters passed to an
application to change the SQL statements that are passed to a database.
SQL injection can be used to insert additional SQL statements to be
executed.
There are multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities in components of SQL
Tunning Sets that can be abused to perform attacks to execute SQL
statements with elevated privileges.  The SQL Injection can be exploited
by convincing the Oracle Enterprise Manager user to click on a malicious
link or visit a web site with malicious content (Cross-site request
forgery attack).

Impact:
An attacker that convinces an Oracle Enterprise Manager user to click or
open a malicious link can impersonate the user and execute SQL statements.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update July 2012 available at Oracle Support.
