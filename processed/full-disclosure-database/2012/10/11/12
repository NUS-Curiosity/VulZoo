Cisco WebEx .wrf Memory Corruption Vulnerability



1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Cisco WebEx .wrf Memory Corruption Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2012-0613
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/webex-wrf-memory-corruption-vulnerability
Date published: 2012-10-11
Date of last update: 2012-09-13
Vendors contacted: Cisco
Release mode: Coordinated release



2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer [CWE-788]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2012-3939



3. *Vulnerability Description*

A vulnerability exists in atas32.dll affecting Cisco WebEx Player v3.26
that allows an attacker to corrupt memory, which may lead to code
execution in the context of the currently logged on user.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Cisco WebEx Player v3.26
   . Cisco Meeting Center and older versions of WebEx Player are
probably affected too, but they were not checked.


5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

If the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was automatically installed, it will be
automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users
access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. A
non-vulnerable version of Cisco WebEx Player should be available at
http://www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html.


6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Oren Isacson. The
publication of this advisory was coordinated by Fernando russ.


7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept*

The memory corruption is caused by a call to the memcpy function with an
invalid destination parameter.

In our proof of concept (POC), the destination parameter to the memcpy
function points to unmapped memory. The source parameters points to
valid heap memory. The size parameter is equal to 540. As the
destination parameter is close to the top of the heap, and the source
parameter points to data that may be user-controlled, this vulnerability
may be leveraged to execute code.
