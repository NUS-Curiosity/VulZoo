Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Request Tracker, an issue

CVE-2012-4735
	Several different vulnerabilities in GnuPG processing allow
	attackers to cause RT to improperly sign outgoing email.

CVE-2012-4884
	If GnuPG support is enabled, authenticated users attackers can
	create arbitrary files as the web server user, which may
	enable arbitrary code execution.

Please note that if you run request-tracker3.8 under the Apache web
server, you must stop and start Apache manually.  The "restart"
mechanism is not recommended, especially when using mod_perl.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.8.8-7+squeeze6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.7-2 of the request-tracker4 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker3.8 packages.
