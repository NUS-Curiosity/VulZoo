Package        : exim4
Vulnerability  : heap-based buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-5671

It was discovered that Exim, a mail transport agent, is not properly
handling the decoding of DNS records for DKIM.  Specifically, crafted
records can yield to a heap-based buffer overflow.  An attacker can
exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.72-6+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.80-5.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.80-5.1.


We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.
