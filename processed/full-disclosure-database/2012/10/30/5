Subject: Context IS Advisory - Citrix XenServer Hypervisor
 Privilege Escalation

==============================ADVISORY===============================
Systems Affected:      Citrix XenServer 5.0 through 6.0.2
Severity:                    High
Category:                  Privilege Escalation
Author:                     Context Information Security
Reported to vendor:  24th May 2012
Advisory Issued:       30th October 2012
Reference:                CVE-2012-4606
==============================ADVISORY===============================
 
Description
-----------
The XenServer remote VNC terminal emulator contains a vulnerability which would allow a user of a guest VM to get code executing in the hypervisor leading to elevation of privilege on the server on which the guest VM was being hosted. 
 
Analysis
--------
Citrix XenServer is distributed with a VT100 terminal emulator which is exposed via the VNC protocol to allow a remote user to administer their hosted para-virtualised machine.  The application does not correctly handle certain escape sequences which can lead to an unprivileged guest VM being able to gain code execution in the fully privileged Dom0 allowing the entire hosting server to be controlled. 
 
It should be noted that the vulnerable code was also used in the QEMU-KVM terminal that can be used by emulated virtual machines; this is under a different CVE, CVE-2012-3515.
 
Technologies Affected
---------------------
Citrix XenServer 6.0
Citrix XenServer 5.6
Citrix XenServer 5.5
Citrix XenServer 5.0
 
Vendor Response
------------------
Vendor issued a security hot fix of the 5th September 2012. See http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX134708 for support information and download locations for different versions of XenServer.
