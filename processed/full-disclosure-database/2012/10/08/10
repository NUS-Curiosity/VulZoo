Package        : bacula
Vulnerability  : information disclosure
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-4430

It was discovered that bacula, a network backup service, does not
properly enforce console ACLs. This could allow information about
resources to be dumped by an otherwise-restricted client.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.2-2.2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.6+dfsg-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your bacula packages.
