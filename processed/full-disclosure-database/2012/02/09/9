Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3670 CVE-2012-0442 CVE-2012-0444 CVE-2012-0449

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, Debian's
variant of the Mozilla Thunderbird code base.

CVE-2011-3670
	Icedove does not not properly enforce the IPv6 literal address
	syntax, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
	information by making XMLHttpRequest calls through a proxy and
	reading the error messages.

CVE-2012-0442
	Memory corruption bugs could cause Icedove to crash or
  	possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-0444
	Icedove does not properly initialize nsChildView data
	structures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
	service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly
	execute arbitrary code via a crafted Ogg Vorbis file.

CVE-2012-0449
	Icedove allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
	(memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via a malformed XSLT stylesheet that is
	embedded in a document

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze7.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
