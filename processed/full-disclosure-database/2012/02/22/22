- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The flaw exists within the handling of VML element positioning. When
appending a VML element to a textArea element a reference to a
cDispScroller object can be improperly freed. The object is can be
reused, and due to this object being freed, a later allocation can be
located in this memory region.  A remote attacker can exploit this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.
