Package        : fex
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-0869

Nicola Fioravanti discovered that F*X, a web service for transferring
very large files, is not properly sanitizing input parameters of the "fup"
script.  An attacker can use this flaw to conduct reflected cross-site
scripting attacks via various script parameters.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 20100208+debian1-1+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed
in version 20120215-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your fex packages.
