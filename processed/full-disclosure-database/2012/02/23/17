Cisco Small Business SRP 500 Series Multiple Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20120223-srp500

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2012 February 23 16:00  UTC (GMT)

Summary
=======

Cisco Small Business (SRP 500) Series Services Ready Platforms
contain the following three vulnerabilities:

  * Cisco SRP 500 Series Web Interface Command Injection
    Vulnerability
  * Cisco SRP 500 Series Unauthenticated Configuration Upload
    Vulnerability
  * Cisco SRP 500 Series Directory Traversal Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities can be exploited using sessions to the Services
Ready Platform Configuration Utility web interface. These
vulnerabilities could be exploited from the local LAN side of the SRP
device by default configuration and the WAN side of the SRP device if
remote management is enabled.  Remote management is disabled by
default.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

Router page to view information about the Cisco SRP Series device and
its firmware status.  The Firmware Version field indicates the
current running version of firmware on the Cisco SRP 500 Series
device.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco SRP 500 Series devices are a flexible, cost-effective,
fixed-configuration customer premises equipment (CPE) with embedded
intelligence to enable service providers to create, provision, and
deploy premium revenue-generating services to small businesses on an
as-needed basis.

Cisco SRP 500 Series devices running affected versions of firmware
contain the following three vulnerabilities.   These vulnerabilities
could be exploited from the local LAN side of the SRP device by
default configuration and the WAN side of the SRP device if remote
management is enabled.  Remote management is disabled by default.

Cisco SRP 500 Series Web Interface Command Injection Vulnerability
+-----------------------------------------------------------------

Cisco SRP 500 Series devices contain a command injection vulnerability
that could allow an authenticated session to inject commands to be
executed by the operating system.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either enticing an
administrator to access a crafted link or by performing a
man-in-the-middle attack to intercept an authenticated session.  An
exploit could allow the attacker to execute operating system commands
on the device that are run in the context of the root user.

This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtt46871 and
has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
CVE-2012-0363.

Cisco SRP 500 Series Unauthenticated Configuration Upload Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cisco SRP 500 Series devices contain an unauthorized access
vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
upload an unauthorized configuration file.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first creating a
desired configuration file and then uploading it using the
unauthenticated URL. An exploit could allow the attacker to alter the
configuration of the Cisco SRP 500 Series device.

This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtw55495 and
has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-0364.

Cisco SRP 500 Series Directory Traversal Vulnerability
+-----------------------------------------------------

Cisco SRP 500 Series devices contain a directory traversal
vulnerability in the Local TFTP file upload application that could
allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload files to directories
in the operating system of the Cisco SRP 500 Series device.  An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enticing an authenticated
user to click on a crafted link or by installing malicious files on
the FTP or HTTP server that the administrators of the device may use.
An exploit could allow the attacker to install malicious software on
the Cisco SRP 500 Series device to launch future attacks.

This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtw56009 and
has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-0365.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has scored the vulnerabilities in this advisory based on the
Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS scoring in this
security advisory is in accordance with CVSS version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps organizations determine the urgency and priority of
a response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can also
compute environmental scores that help determine the impact of the
vulnerability in their own networks.

Cisco has provided additional information regarding CVSS at the
following link:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html
 

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at the following link:

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may result in the
execution of arbitrary commands on the device or the uploading of
files that may be malicious, which may allow the attacker to alter the
device configuration.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult:
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt

As well as any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a
complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

The Cisco SRP 500 Series devices are designed as CPE devices, and only
disabling access from the outside network will prevent exploitation,
from remote networks.  The following mitigations help limit exposure
to this vulnerability:

  * Disable Remote Management

    Caution: Do not disable remote management if administrators
    manage devices using the WAN connection. This action will result
    in a loss of management connectivity to the device.

    Remote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled,
    administrators can disable this feature by choosing
    Administration > Web Access Management. Change the setting for
    the Remote Management field to Disabled.

    Disabling remote management limits exposure because the
    vulnerability can then be exploited from the inter-LAN network
    only.

  * Limit Remote Management Access to Specific IP Addresses

    If remote management is required, secure the device so that it
    can be accessed by certain IP addresses only, rather than the
    default setting of All IP Addresses. After choosing
    Administration > Web Access Management, an administrator can
    change the Allowed Remote IP Address setting to ensure that only
    devices with specified IP addresses can access the device.
