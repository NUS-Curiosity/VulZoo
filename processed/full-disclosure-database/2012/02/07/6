CVE-2012-0803: Apache CXF does not validate UsernameToken policies correctly

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Apache CXF 2.4.5 and 2.5.1

Description: CXF does not validate a WS-Security UsernameToken received as part
of the security header of a SOAP request against a WS-SP UsernameToken policy.

A malicious client could send a request to the endpoint with no UsernameToken,
and the UsernameToken policy requirement would still be marked as valid.

This has been fixed in revision:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1233457

This issue was a regression in CXF 2.4.5 and 2.5.1. The vulnerability does not
exist in CXF 2.4.4 and 2.5.0.

Migration:

CXF 2.4.5 users should upgrade to 2.4.6 as soon as possible.
CXF 2.5.1 users should upgrade to 2.5.2 as soon as possible.
