ZDI-12-021 : Adobe Reader BMP Resource Signedness Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability

7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

- -- Affected Products:

- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader X. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within 2d.x3d, which is Adobe Reader's code
responsible for processing BMP files. When passing a negative size
parameter in the 'colors' field, a series of signed comparisons will be
averted, and the overly large size parameter is passed to a memcpy().
This will cause a heap-based buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to
execute code under the context of the user.

- -- Vendor Response:

Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
