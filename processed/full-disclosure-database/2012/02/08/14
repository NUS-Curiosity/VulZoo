- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM SPSS. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the Render() method exposed by the
ExportHTML.dll ActiveX control. This method causes a file to be written
to an arbitrary path specified by the second argument (Output). The
contents of the file can be controlled by manipulating the object
members 'CssLocation', 'LayoutStyle' and 'EmbedCss'. The CssLocation
member can be directed to a UNC path containing a file to be included in
the file generated by the call to Render(). These behaviors can be
exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

- -- Vendor Response:

IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can
