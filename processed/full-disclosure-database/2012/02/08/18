- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of IBM Rational Rhapsody. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within BB FlashBack Recorder.dll. Uninitialized
pointers may be passed as arguments to TestCompatibilityRecordMode()
which allows a remote attacker to reliably corrupt controlled memory
regions. This behavior can be exploited to remotely execute arbitrary
code in the context of the user running the browser.
