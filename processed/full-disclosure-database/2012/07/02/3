 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2012:096-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : python
 Date    : July 2, 2012
 Affected: Enterprise Server 5.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been discovered and corrected in python:
 
 The _ssl module would always disable the CBC IV attack countermeasure
 (CVE-2011-3389).
 
 A flaw was found in the way the Python SimpleHTTPServer module
 generated directory listings. An attacker able to upload a file
 with a specially-crafted name to a server could possibly perform a
 cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against victims visiting a listing
 page generated by SimpleHTTPServer, for a directory containing
 the crafted file (if the victims were using certain web browsers)
 (CVE-2011-4940).
 
 A race condition was found in the way the Python distutils module
 set file permissions during the creation of the .pypirc file. If a
 local user had access to the home directory of another user who is
 running distutils, they could use this flaw to gain access to that
 user&#039;s .pypirc file, which can contain usernames and passwords for
 code repositories (CVE-2011-4944).
 
 A flaw was found in the way the Python SimpleXMLRPCServer module
 handled clients disconnecting prematurely. A remote attacker could
 use this flaw to cause excessive CPU consumption on a server using
 SimpleXMLRPCServer (CVE-2012-0845).
 
 Hash table collisions CPU usage DoS for the embedded copy of expat
 (CVE-2012-0876).
 
 A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative
 arrays (dictionaries) in Python. An attacker able to supply a large
 number of inputs to a Python application (such as HTTP POST request
 parameters sent to a web application) that are used as keys when
 inserting data into an array could trigger multiple hash function
 collisions, making array operations take an excessive amount of
 CPU time. To mitigate this issue, randomization has been added to
 the hash function to reduce the chance of an attacker successfully
 causing intentional collisions (CVE-2012-1150).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.

 Update:

 Packages for Mandriva Enterprise Server 5 is also being provided.
