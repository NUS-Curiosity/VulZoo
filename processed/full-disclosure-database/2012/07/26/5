 Affected: 2011.
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected in arpwatch:
 
 arpwatch 2.1a15, as used by Red Hat, Debian, Fedora, and possibly
 others, does not properly drop supplementary groups, which might allow
 attackers to gain root privileges by leveraging other vulnerabilities
 in the daemon (CVE-2012-2653).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.
