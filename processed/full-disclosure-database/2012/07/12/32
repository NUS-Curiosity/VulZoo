- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of EMC Autostart. Authentication is not required
to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the ftAgent.exe service, which listens by
default on TCP port 8045. When handling messages with opcode 65 (0x41) and
subcode 00, the vulnerable function uses a uninitialized stack variable in
calculating a memory pointer. Also, the function uses signed extension and
signed comparison when checking the uninitialized stack variable, which
allows arbitrary negative values to bypass the check. This could result in
corruption of a controlled memory location, which can be leveraged to
execute code under the context of the SYSTEM user.


- -- Vendor Response:
EMC has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be
