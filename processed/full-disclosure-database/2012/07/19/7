Package        : iceape
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-1948 CVE-2012-1954 CVE-2012-1967

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Iceape internet suite,
an unbranded version of Seamonkey:

CVE-2012-1948

  Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey
  identified several memory safety problems that may lead to the
  execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-1954

  Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free problem in nsDocument::AdoptNode
  that may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-1967

  moz_bug_r_a4 discovered that in certain cases, javascript:: URLs can
  be executed so that scripts can escape the JavaScript sandbox and run
  with elevated privileges.  This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-14.

For the unstable (sid) and testing (wheezy) distribution, this problem
will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
