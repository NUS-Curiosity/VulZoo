Package        : bind9
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3817

Einar Lonn discovered that under certain conditions bind9, a DNS server,
may use cached data before initialization.  As a result, an attacker can
trigger and assertion failure on servers under high query load that do
DNSSEC validation.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze6.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.1.dfsg.P1-4.2.


We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
