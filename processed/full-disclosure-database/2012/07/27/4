Finding 1: HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
CVE: CVE-2012-2626

The Scrutinizer web console provides a form-based login facility, requiring
users to authenticate to gain access to further functionality. A tiered
user access model is also used, where administrative and standard users
have a different selection of permissible functions. Authentication and
authorization is controlled by the cookie-based session management system.
Although this is implemented in a standardized way, the session tokens are
not required to perform privileged functions, such as adding users.

Example(s):

This request will add a user named "trustwave" with the password of
"trustwave" to the administrative user group.

#Request

{"new_user_id":"2"}


Finding 2: Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability
CVE: CVE-2012-2627

The Scrutinizer web console is prone to unauthenticated arbitrary file upload
vulnerability.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to upload files
to the affected systems file system as well as overwrite the Scrutinizer
applications SNMP configuration.

Example(s):

This request will upload a test file to the following location:

'C:\Program Files (x86)\Scrutinizer\snmp\mibs\trustwave.txt'

Note: This affected folder also contains SNMP configuration files which could
be overwritten if an attacker were to select the right file name.

#Request
POST /d4d/uploader.php HTTP/1.0
Host: A.B.C.D
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)

Finding 3: Multiple Cross-site Scripting Vulnerabilities in exporters.php and contextMenu.php
CVE: CVE-2012-3848

The Scrutinizer web console suffers from multiple Cross Site Scripting
vulnerabilities in the following pages:

1.) /d4d/contextMenu.php
2.) /d4d/exporters.php

These vulnerabilities include the following:

1.) XSS via arbitrary parameter
3.) XSS via referrer header

Example(s):

The following two examples will demonstrate the the above mentioned vulnerabilities on exporters.php

#Request 1
GET /d4d/exporters.php?a<script>alert(123)</script>=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: A.B.C.D
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; rv:12.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/12.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive

#Response 1
<snip>
<a href="/d4d/exporters.php?a<script>alert(1)</script>=1">/d4d/exporters.php?a<script>alert(123)</script>=1</a></td></tr>
<snip>

#Request 2
GET /d4d/exporters.php HTTP/1.1
Host: A.B.C.D
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0)
Connection: close
Referer: http://D.E.F.G/search?hl=en&q=a<script>alert(123)</script>=1
Content-Length: 2

#Response 2
<snip>
<a href="http://D.E.F.G/search?hl=en&q=a<script>alert(123)</script>=1">http://D.E.F.G/search?hl=en&q=a<script>alert(123)</script>=1</a>
<snip>

Finding 4: Undocumented Default Admin MySQL Users
CVE: CVE-2012-3951

The Scrutinizer application relies on an underlying Apache, MySQL and PHP
installation which is installed as part of the scrutinizer installer
package.  The installation of these packages are transparent to the user
during the Scrutinizer installation.

The installation selects default passwords for internal MySQL Users which
are not configured by the user which could be easily guessed by an
attacker.  There is currently no way to change these values within the
Scrutinizer application and changing them manually in the MySQL instance
has unknown effects on the application due to hardcoded values for some of
these accounts.

Example(s):

The following MySQL command can be run to see the users and their relative
passwords:

#Request
select User,Password from mysql.user;

#Response
User          |Password
root          |
root          |
scrutinizer   |*4ACFE3202A5FF5CF467898FC58AAB1D615029441
scrutremote   |*4ACFE3202A5FF5CF467898FC58AAB1D615029441

Note 1: the above hash shared between the 'scrutinizer' and 'scrutremote'
users is equivalent to 'admin'

Note 2: the 'scrutinizer' and 'scrutremote' users have select, update,
delete, create, drop, and more permissions within the MySQL instance.

Note 3: By default, the MySQL instance is bound to "0.0.0.0", the
equivalent of every network interface on the system allowing users with the
proper access rights to interact directly with the MySQL instance.


Remediation Steps:
Customers should update to the latest version of Scrutinizer NetFlow &
sFlow Analyzer in order to address findings 1, 2 and 3. These issues have been
corrected in version 9.5.0.

Revision History:
05/02/12 - Vulnerability disclosed
