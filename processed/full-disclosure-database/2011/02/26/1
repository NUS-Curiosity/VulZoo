A security issue affects the following Ubuntu releases:

Ubuntu 9.10

This advisory also applies to the corresponding versions of
Kubuntu, Edubuntu, and Xubuntu.

The problem can be corrected by upgrading your system to the
following package versions:

Ubuntu 9.10:
  linux-image-2.6.31-112-imx51    2.6.31-112.30

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.
