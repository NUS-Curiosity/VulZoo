February 8, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0694

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
RealNetworks

-- Affected Products:
RealNetworks RealPlayer

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file. 

The flaw exists within the temporary file naming scheme used for storage
of references to Real Media files. This easily predictable temporary
filename can be brute forced and used in combination with the
OpenURLinPlayerBrowser function available in
classid:FDC7A535-4070-4B92-A0EA-D9994BCC0DC5 to execute the file. A
remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code
under the context of the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
