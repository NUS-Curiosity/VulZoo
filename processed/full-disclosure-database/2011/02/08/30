ZDI-11-067: Adobe Acrobat Reader U3D Texture rgba RLE Decompression Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

February 8, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0591

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Adobe

-- Affected Products:
Adobe Reader

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Reader. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the application's implementation of an
image format supported by the Universal 3D compressed file format. When
decoding the image data provided by the file, the application will one
size for allocating space for the destination buffer and then trust the
data when decompressing into that buffer. Due to the decompression being
unbounded by the actual buffer size, a buffer overflow can be triggered
leading to code execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
