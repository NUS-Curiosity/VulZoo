-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of 3D assets within a
director movie. The routine responsible for parsing 3D record type
0xFFFFFF88 does not properly validate multiple fields within the
structure. If these values are too large, the process can create a
faulty allocation. Later, when the rendering routine attempts to use
this buffer memory is corrupted. This can be abused by remote attackers
to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the
browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
