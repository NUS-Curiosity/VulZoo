-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing font
structures within Director files. While processing data within the PFR1
chunk, the process trusts a size value and compares a sign-extended
counter against it within a copy loop. By providing a sufficiently large
value, this flaw can be abused by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
code under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
