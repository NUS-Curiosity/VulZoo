-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the DIRAPI.dll module distributed with
the player. While parsing a director movie (.dir or .dcr) the code
trusts the specified size of the IFWV chunk and uses it within a
calculation to determine another offset within the file. By setting it
to 0, the code jumps to the wrong location within the file. While
parsing data at the new location, the code uses a value as a loop
counter. Within the loop, the code copies data to a heap buffer. By
crafting a file with a large enough size, this loop can be forced to
corrupt memory. A remote attacker can abuse this logic to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the user running the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
