Matthew Nicholson discovered a buffer overflow in the SIP channel driver
of Asterisk, an open source PBX and telephony toolkit, which could lead
to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny2.

version 1.6.2.9-2+squeeze1.

The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.
