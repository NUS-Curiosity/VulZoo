Details
=======

Cisco Security Agent provides threat protection for server and
desktop computing systems. Cisco Security Agent can function in a
standalone manner or can be managed by the Management Center for
Cisco Security Agent.

The Management Center for Cisco Security Agent is affected by a
vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform
remote code execution on the affected device. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to modify agent policies and system
configuration and perform other administrative tasks.

Note: This vulnerability can be exploited only by sending certain
packets to the web management interface, which by default listens on
TCP port 443.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtj51216
and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) 
identifier CVE-2011-0364.

Workarounds
===========

The following policy can be configured as a workaround to mitigate
this vulnerability. Complete the following steps to deploy this
policy for the Cisco Security Agent running on the Management Center
for Cisco Security Agent server.

Create a New Application Class
+-----------------------------

Step 1. Specify the name of the application class as 'CSA MC - all
applications but not its descendants'.

Step 2. Select when created from one of the following executables in
the Add Process to application class area and specify @(regpath HKLM\
SOFTWARE\Cisco\CSAMC60\ProductRootDir default=**\CSAMC*)\**\*.exe as
the value.

Step 3. Ensure that the Only this process option is selected.

Step 4. Click Save.

Create a priority deny Application Control Rule
+----------------------------------------------

Step 1. Name the APCR as CSAMC applications invoking non-CSAMC
applications for better readability.

Step 2. Enable logging.

Step 3. For Current applications in any of the following selected
classes select the application class created under "Create a New
Application Class." For the But not option, select <none>.

Step 4. For New applications in any of the following selected classes
select <All Applications>. For the But not option, select the new
application class created under "Create a New Application Class."

Step 5. Click Save.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability. Prior to deploying software, customers should consult
their maintenance provider or check the software for feature set
compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html, 
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
