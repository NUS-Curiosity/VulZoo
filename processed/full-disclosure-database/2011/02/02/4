ZDI-11-038: Apple Quicktime Sprite Transformation Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-038

February 1, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-3790

-- CVSS:
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Apple

-- Affected Products:
Apple Quicktime

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application performs a
transformation on an image sample using the sprite handler. When
performing the transformation, the application will scale the sprite
outside the bounds of the original buffer. This can cause memory
corruption which can lead to code execution within the context of the
application.
