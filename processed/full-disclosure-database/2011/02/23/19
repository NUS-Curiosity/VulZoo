+----------------------------------------+

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco TelePresence Manager devices that are running an affected
version of software are affected.

To determine the current version of software that is running on the
Cisco TelePresence Manager, establish an SSH connection to the device
and issue the show version active and the show version inactive
commands. The output should resemble the following example:

    admin: show version active
    Active Master Version: 1.7.0.0-471

    Active Version Installed Software Options:
    No Installed Software Options Found.

    admin: show version inactive
    Inactive Master Version: 1.6.0.0-342

    Inactive Version Installed Software Options:
    No Installed Software Options Found.

In the preceding example, the system has versions 1.6.0 and 1.7.0
loaded on the device, and version 1.7.0 is currently active. A device
is affected only by vulnerabilities that are in the active software
version.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco TelePresence solution allows for immersive, in-person
communication and collaboration over the network with colleagues,
prospects, and partners, even when they are located in opposite
hemispheres.

This security advisory describes multiple, distinct vulnerabilities
in the Cisco TelePresence Manager. These vulnerabilities are
independent of each other.

SOAP Authentication Bypass
+-------------------------

An authentication bypass vulnerability exists that could allow a
remote, unauthenticated attacker to invoke arbitrary methods that are
available via the SOAP interface on the Cisco TelePresence Manager.
The attacker would need the ability to submit a malformed SOAP
request that is designed to trigger the vulnerability to the affected
device on TCP port 8080 or 8443.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit this vulnerability.

  * Cisco TelePresence Manager: CSCtc59562 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
    (CVE) identifier CVE-2011-0380.

Java RMI Command Injection
+-------------------------

A command injection vulnerability exists in the Java RMI interface
that is exposed on the Cisco TelePresence Manager. The vulnerability
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a number
of actions on the device with elevated privileges. The attacker would
need to be able to submit a crafted request to the affected device on
TCP port 1100 or 32000.

An attacker must perform a three-way TCP handshake and establish a
valid session to exploit these vulnerabilities.

  * Cisco TelePresence Manager: CSCtf97085 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0381.

Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution
+---------------------------------------------

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Cisco TelePresence
Manager devices. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated,
adjacent attacker to trigger a buffer overflow condition. The
attacker would need the ability to submit a malicious Cisco Discovery
Protocol packet to the affected system to exploit this vulnerability.

Because Cisco Discovery Protocol operates at Layer 2, an attacker
must have a way to submit an Ethernet frame directly to an affected
device. This submission may be possible in situations in which the
affected system is part of a bridged network or connected to a
nonpartitioned device, such as a network hub.

  * Cisco TelePresence Manager: CSCtd75761 ( registered customers
    only) has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0379.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
+----------------------------

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the SOAP Authentication Bypass
vulnerability (CSCtc59562) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to issue SOAP requests to the affected system. This could
allow the attacker to perform multiple actions that should be
restricted to authenticated users.

Successful exploitation of the Java RMI Command Injection
Vulnerability (CSCtf97085) could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to take complete control of the affected device.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code
Execution vulnerability (CSCtd75761) could allow an unauthenticated,
adjacent attacker to take complete control of the affected system.
