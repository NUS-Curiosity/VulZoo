Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA 5500
Series Adaptive Security Appliances

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110223-asa

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 February 23 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are affected by the
following vulnerabilities:

  * Transparent Firewall Packet Buffer Exhaustion Vulnerability
  * Skinny Client Control Protocol (SCCP) Inspection Denial of
    Service Vulnerability
  * Routing Information Protocol (RIP) Denial of Service
    Vulnerability
  * Unauthorized File System Access Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are independent; a release that is affected by
one vulnerability is not necessarily affected by the others.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110223-asa.shtml.

Note: The Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) is affected
by one of these vulnerabilities. A separate Cisco Security
Advisory has been published to disclose the vulnerability
that affects the Cisco FWSM. That advisory is available at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110223-fwsm.shtml.

Affected Products
=================

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are affected by
multiple vulnerabilities. Affected versions of Cisco ASA Software
vary depending on the specific vulnerability.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

For specific version information, refer to the Software Versions and
Fixes section of this advisory.

Transparent Firewall Packet Buffer Exhaustion Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------------------------

A packet buffer exhaustion vulnerability affects multiple versions of
Cisco ASA Software when a security appliance is configured to operate in
the transparent firewall mode. Transparent firewall mode is enabled on
the appliance if the command "firewall transparent" is present in the
configuration. The default firewall mode is routed, not transparent.
The "show firewall" command can also be used to determine the firewall
operation mode:

    ciscoasa# show firewall
    Firewall mode: Transparent

SCCP Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------------

A denial of service vulnerability affects the SCCP inspection feature
of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.

Administrators can determine if SCCP inspection is enabled by issuing
the "show service-policy | include skinny" command and confirming that
output, such as what is displayed in the following example, is returned.

    ciscoasa# show service-policy | include skinny
          Inspect: skinny, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0

Alternatively, a device that has SCCP inspection enabled has a
configuration similar to the following:

    class-map inspection_default
     match default-inspection-traffic

    !

    policy-map global_policy
     class inspection_default
      ...
      inspect skinny
      ...

    !

    service-policy global_policy global

Note: The service policy could also be applied to a specific
interface instead of globally, which is displayed in the previous
example.

SCCP inspection is enabled by default.

RIP Denial of Service Vulnerability
+----------------------------------

A denial of service vulnerability affects the RIP implementation in
Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances when both RIP and
the Cisco Phone Proxy feature are enabled on the same device. The
following example displays an affected configuration (Cisco ASA
Software version 8.0 and 8.1):

    router rip
     ...

    !

    phone-proxy <instance name>
      media-termination address <IP address>
    ...
    <Rest of phone proxy feature configuration>

Or (Cisco ASA Software version 8.2 and later):

    router rip
     ...

    !

    media-termination <instance name>
     address <IP address>

    !

    <Rest of phone proxy feature configuration>

A security appliance is vulnerable if it is processing RIP messages
("router rip") and if a global media termination address is configured
for the Cisco Phone Proxy feature (refer to previous example). Note
that Cisco ASA Software versions 8.0 and 8.1 only allow a global
media termination address. However, in Cisco ASA Software version 8.2
and later, it is possible to tie a media termination address to an
interface. This configuration, which is accomplished by issuing the
command "address <IP address> interface <interface name>" in media
termination configuration mode, is not affected.

Neither RIP nor the Cisco Phone Proxy feature is enabled by default.

Unauthorized File System Access Vulnerability
+--------------------------------------------

An unauthorized file system access vulnerability affects Cisco ASA
5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances when a security appliance is
configured as a local Certificate Authority (CA). An affected
configuration consists of the following minimum commands:

    crypto ca trustpoint <trustpoint name>
     keypair <keypair name>
     crl configure
    crypto ca server
    crypto ca certificate chain <trustpoint name>
     certificate ca 01
      ...

    !

    http server enable

The local CA server is not enabled by default.

Cisco PIX 500 Series Security Appliance Vulnerability Status
+-----------------------------------------------------------

Cisco PIX 500 Series Security Appliances are affected by the
Transparent Firewall Packet Buffer Exhaustion Vulnerability and the
SCCP Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability.

Because Cisco PIX 500 Series Security Appliances reached the end
of software maintenance releases milestone on July 28, 2009,
no further software releases will be available. Cisco PIX 500
Series Security Appliance customers are encouraged to migrate
to Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances or to
implement any applicable workarounds that are listed in the
Workarounds section of this advisory. Fixed software is available
for Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances only.
For more information, refer to the End of Life announcement at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/vpndevc/ps5708/ps5709/ps2030/end_of_life_notice_cisco_pix_525_sec_app.html.

How to Determine Software Versions
+---------------------------------

To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is
running on an appliance, administrators can issue the "show version"
command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive
Security Appliance that is running software version 8.3(1):

    ASA#show version | include Version
    Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.3(1)
    Device Manager Version 6.3(1)

Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to
manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is
displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM
window.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

With the exception of Cisco PIX 500 Series Security Appliances and
the Cisco Firewall Services Module, no other Cisco products are
currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance is a modular
platform that provides security and VPN services. It offers firewall,
intrusion prevention system (IPS), anti-X, and virtual private
network (VPN) services.

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are affected by
the following vulnerabilities:

Transparent Firewall Packet Buffer Exhaustion Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------------------------

A Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance that is
configured for transparent firewall mode is affected by a packet
buffer exhaustion vulnerability that could cause an appliance to stop
forwarding traffic once all packet buffers are depleted. The number
of available packet buffers may decrease when a security appliance
receives IPv6 traffic and is not configured for IPv6 operation. IPv6
transit traffic does not cause a problem.

Administrators can check packet buffer utilization by issuing the
command "show blocks" and inspecting the output for the number of
available 1,550-byte blocks. If the number of blocks is zero (indicated
by 0 in the CNT column), then the security appliance may be experiencing
this issue. For example:

    ciscoasa# show blocks
      SIZE    MAX    LOW    CNT
         0    400    360    400
         4    200    199    199
        80    400    358    400
       256   1412   1381   1412
      1550   6274      0      0
      ...

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtj04707 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-0393.

SCCP Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------------

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are affected by a
vulnerability that could cause the appliance to reload when it
processes a malformed SCCP message. Appliances are only vulnerable if
SCCP inspection is enabled.

Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability; traffic that is
destined to the appliance will not trigger the vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtg69457 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-0394.

RIP Denial of Service Vulnerability
+----------------------------------

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are affected by a
vulnerability that could cause the appliance to reload when it
processes valid RIP updates. Appliances are vulnerable only if both
RIP and the Cisco Phone Proxy feature are enabled.

Note:  the affected configuration requires that a global media
termination address is configured, which is the only possible
configuration option in Cisco ASA Software versions 8.0 and 8.1.
However, it is possible to tie a media termination address to an
interface in Cisco ASA Software version 8.2 and later. This
configuration is not vulnerable.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtg66583 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-0395.

Unauthorized File System Access Vulnerability
+--------------------------------------------

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances are affected by a
vulnerability that could allow unauthorized users to access a file
system (flash:, disk0:, disk1:, etc. but not system:) when the
security appliance is configured as a local CA server. No
authentication is required. File systems could contain sensitive
information, such as backup device configurations (which may contain
passwords or shared secrets), Cisco ASA Software images, or digital
certificates.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtk12352 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-0396.

with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
