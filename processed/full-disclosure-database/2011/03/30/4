3. Problem Description

 a. VMware Linux based vmrun utility local privilege escalation

    VMware vmrun is a utility that is used to perform various tasks on
    virtual machines. The vmrun utility runs on any platform with VIX
    libraries installed. It is installed in VMware Workstation by
    default.

    In non-standard filesystem configurations, an attacker with the
    ability to place files into a predefined library path, could take
    execution control of vmrun.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2011-1126 to this issue.

    VMware would like to thank Tim Brown for reporting this issue to
    us.

    remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
    available.
