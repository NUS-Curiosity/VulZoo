-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP Client Automation. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The flaw exists within the radexecd.exe component which listens by
default on TCP port 3465. When handling a remote execute request the
process does not properly authenticate the user issuing the request.
Utilities are stored in the 'secure' path which enable an attacker to
re-execute an arbitrary executable. A remote attacker can exploit this
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM
user.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
