1. *Advisory Information*

Title: VLC Vulnerabilities handling .AMV and .NSV files
Advisory ID: CORE-2011-0208
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/vlc-vulnerabilities-amv-nsv-files
Date published: 2011-03-23
Date of last update: 2011-03-23
Vendors contacted: VLC team
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119], Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes (client-side)
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2010-3275, CVE-2010-3276


3. *Vulnerability Description*

Two vulnerabilities have been found in VLC media player [1], when
handling .AMV and .NSV file formats. These vulnerabilities can be
exploited by a remote attacker to obtain arbitrary code execution with
the privileges of the user running VLC.


4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . VLC 1.1.4
   . VLC 1.1.5
   . VLC 1.1.6
   . VLC 1.1.7
   . Older versions may be affected, but were not checked.


5. *Non-vulnerable packages*

   . VLC 1.1.8


6. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

These vulnerabilities are fixed in VLC version 1.1.8, which can be
downloaded from http://www.videolan.org/


7. *Credits*

These vulnerabilities were discovered and researched by Ricardo Narvaja
from Core Security Technologies. Publication was coordinated by Carlos
Sarraute.


8. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*


8.1. *Vulnerability in VLC 1.1.4 to 1.1.7 when handling AMV files
[CVE-2010-3275]*

This vulnerability was found by fuzzing different formats. In AMV files
if the offset 0x41 is changed to a value greater than 90 as shown below:

/-----
Offset(h)

00000000  52 49 46 46 00 00 00 00 41 4D 56 20 4C 49 53 54  RIFF....AMV LIST
00000010  00 00 00 00 68 64 72 6C 61 6D 76 68 38 00 00 00  ....hdrlamvh8...
00000020  24 F4 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  $Ã´..............
