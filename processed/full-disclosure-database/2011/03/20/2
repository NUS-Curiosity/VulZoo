Package        : maradns
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0520
Debian Bug     : 610834

Witold Baryluk discovered that MaraDNS, a simple security-focused
Domain Name Service server, may overflow an internal buffer when
handling requests with a large number of labels, causing a server
crash and the consequent denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.07.09-2.1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze) and greater this problem had
already been fixed in version 1.4.03-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your maradns packages.
