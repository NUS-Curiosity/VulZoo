Package        : mahara
Vulnerability  : several
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-0439 CVE-2011-0440
Debian-specific: no

Two security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mahara, a fully
featured electronic portfolio, weblog, resume builder and social
networking system:

CVE-2011-0439

    A security review commissioned by a Mahara user discovered that
    Mahara processes unsanitized input which can lead to cross-site
    scripting (XSS).

CVE-2011-0440

    Mahara Developers discovered that Mahara doesn't check the session
    key under certain circumstances which can be exploited as
    cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and can lead to the deletion of
    blogs.

For the old stable distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny8.

For the stable distribution (squeeze) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.7.

We recommend that you upgrade your mahara package.
