Package        : isc-dhcp
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0413
Debian Bug     : 611217

It was discovered that the ISC DHCPv6 server does not correctly
process requests which come from unexpected source addresses, leading
to an assertion failure and a daemon crash.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 4.1.1-P1-16.

We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.
