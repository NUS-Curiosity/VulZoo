Package        : nbd
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0530

It was discovered a regression of a buffer overflow (CVE-2005-3534) in nbd, 
the Network Block Device server, that could allow arbitrary code execution
on the NBD server via a large request.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.9.11-3lenny1.

The stable distribution (squeeze), the testing distribution (wheezy),
and the unstable distribution (sid) are not affected. This problem was
fixed prior the release of squeeze in version 1:2.9.16-8.


We recommend that you upgrade your nbd packages.
