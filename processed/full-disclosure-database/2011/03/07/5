You are quite right that false security is a serious and pervasive
problem today.
If there is a problem with Python's SSL implementation, which I assume there is,
it should be fixed, regardless of breaking existing applications.

Yes, the snake oil salesman has never had a better opportunity to make
a buck than 1996 to today.

If it's trivial for you to break asymmetric encryption you wouldn't be publicly
making the claim that it was trivial for you to break asymmetric encryption.

Even that is shade of gray. True, the magnitude and growth of O is unchanged,
but sorry friend, 5 does not equal 10.

I also explained why it's not a comparison of 5 to 10.

Especially if in that 5 you are caught and your attack stopped.

Which, you would be, if you were on my network.

CVE-2008-2538
CVE-2007-4070
CVE-2006-4315
CVE-2005-4158
CVE-2005-1993

I suppose then, by your own standard, you should respect my argument
and stop defending a broken position?
No... I wouldn't expect you to. There's always someone with better
credentials. Stay out of this Michal! ;D
