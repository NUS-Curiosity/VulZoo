Package        : quagga
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-1674 CVE-2010-1675

It has been discovered that the Quagga routing daemon contains two
denial-of-service vulnerabilities in its BGP implementation:

CVE-2010-1674
	A crafted Extended Communities attribute triggers a null
        pointer dereference which causes the BGP daemon to crash.
	The crafted attributes are not propagated by the Internet
	core, so only explicitly configured direct peers are able
	to exploit this vulnerability in typical configurations.

CVE-2010-1675
	The BGP daemon resets BGP sessions when it encounters
	malformed AS_PATHLIMIT attributes, introducing a distributed
	BGP session reset vulnerability which disrupts packet
	forwarding.  Such malformed attributes are propagated by the
	Internet core, and exploitation of this vulnerability is not
	restricted to directly configured BGP peers.

This security update removes AS_PATHLIMIT processing from the BGP
implementation, preserving the configuration statements for backwards
compatibility.  (Standardization of this BGP extension was abandoned
long ago.)

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.10-1lenny5.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.17-2+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.
