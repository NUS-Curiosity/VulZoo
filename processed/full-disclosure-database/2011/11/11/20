Package        : icedove
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3647 CVE-2011-3648 CVE-2011-3650

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, a mail client
based on Thunderbird.

CVE-2011-3647
        The JSSubScriptLoader does not properly handle
        XPCNativeWrappers during calls to the loadSubScript method in
        an add-on, which makes it easier for remote attackers to gain
        privileges via a crafted web site that leverages certain
        unwrapping behavior.

CVE-2011-3648
	A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote
	attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted
	text with Shift JIS encoding.

CVE-2011-3650 
        Iceweasel does not properly handle JavaScript files that
	contain many functions, which allows user-assisted remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
	application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
	via a crafted file that is accessed by debugging APIs, as
	demonstrated by Firebug.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.11-1+squeeze6.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.1.15-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
