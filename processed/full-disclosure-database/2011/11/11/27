Synopsis
========

phpDocumentor bundles Smarty which contains an input sanitation flaw,
allowing attackers to call arbitrary PHP functions.

Background
==========

The phpDocumentor package provides automatic documenting of PHP API
directly from the source.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-php/PEAR-PhpDocumentor
                                 < 1.4.3-r1               >= 1.4.3-r1

Description
===========

phpDocumentor bundles Smarty with the modifier.regex_replace.php
plug-in which does not properly sanitize input related to the ASCII NUL
character in a search string.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could call arbitrary PHP functions via templates.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpDocumentor users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=dev-php/PEAR-PhpDocumentor-1.4.3-r1"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since February 12, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
