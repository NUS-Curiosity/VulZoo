Subject: Integer Overflow in Apache ap_pregsub via
	mod-setenvif

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

An exploitable integer overflow in apache allows to crash the apache
process or execution of arbitrary code as user running apache. To
exploit the vulnerability, a crafted .htaccess file has to be placed
on the server, therefore the vulnerability impact is rated "Low".

Micro-Advisory:
http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/
CVE: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3607

See advisory for more information about the vulnerability and (very
bad) example to execute arbitrary code, using racy code.

It should be possible to execute code without the need for a race
using crafted stop sequences, but I haven't managed to do it so far.
Perhaps someone else might take up the challenge.
