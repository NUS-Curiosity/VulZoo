Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities, including buffer overflows, have been found
in abcm2ps.

Background
==========

abcm2ps is a program to convert abc files to Postscript files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/abcm2ps          < 5.9.13                  >= 5.9.13 

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in abcm2ps:

* Boundary errors in the PUT0 and PUT1 macros, the trim_title()
  function, or a long "-O" command line option can lead to a buffer
  overflow (CVE-2010-3441).
* A vulnerability in the getarena() function in abc2ps.c can cause a
  heap-based buffer overflow in abcm2ps (CVE-2010-4743).
* Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities (CVE-2010-4744).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to load a specially crafted ABC
file or use a long -O option on the command line, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All abcm2ps users should upgrade to the latest stable version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/abcm2ps-5.9.13"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since August 27, 2010. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
