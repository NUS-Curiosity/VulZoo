Synopsis

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in radvd which could
potentially lead to privilege escalation, data loss, or a Denial of
Service.

Background
==========

radvd is an IPv6 router advertisement daemon for Linux and BSD.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in radvd. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to gain escalated
privileges, escalate the privileges of the radvd process, overwrite
files with specific names, or cause a Denial of Service. Local
attackers may be able to overwrite the contents of arbitrary files
using symlinks.

Workaround
==========
