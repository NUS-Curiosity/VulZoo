ZDI-11-317 : Novell ZENWorks Software Packaging Antique ActiveX
Control Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-317
November  7, 2011

- -- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-2658

- -- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

- -- Affected Vendors:

Novell



- -- Affected Products:

Novell Zenworks



- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
on vulnerable installations of Novell ZENWorks. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists due to the inclusion and usage of an antique
ActiveX control (mscomct2.ocx: Tue Mar 14 18:39:28 2000). Though
mscomct2.ocx has been killbitted, it is accessed by ZENWorks via an
intermediate control (ISList.ISAvi) which is scriptable. Multiple
vulnerabilities in mscomct2.ocx can be exploited to execute arbitrary
code on the host system in the context of the browser.

Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
