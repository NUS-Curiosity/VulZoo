- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists when the application attempts to parse a height
out of the RV10 codec object. The application will incorrectly treat the
value as a signed integer and will its value as the count within a loop
that populates rows of sample data within a buffer. This can allow for
memory corruption which can lead to code execution under the context of
the application.
