    implementation. Local users can obtain access to sensitive kernel memory on
    systems that use this rare hardware.

CVE-2011-1180

    Dan Rosenberg reported a buffer overflow in the Information Access Service
    of the IrDA protocol, used for Infrared devices. Remote attackers within IR
    device range can cause a denial of service or possibly gain elevated
    privileges.

CVE-2011-1182

    Julien Tinnes reported an issue in the rt_sigqueueinfo interface. Local
    users can generate signals with falsified source pid and uid information.

CVE-2011-1477

    Dan Rosenberg reported issues in the Open Sound System driver for cards that
    include a Yamaha FM synthesizer chip. Local users can cause memory
    corruption resulting in a denial of service. This issue does not affect
    official Debian Linux image packages as they no longer provide support for
    OSS.  However, custom kernels built from Debians linux-source-2.6.32 may
    have enabled this configuration and would therefore be vulnerable.

CVE-2011-1493

    Dan Rosenburg reported two issues in the Linux implementation of the
    Amateur Radio X.25 PLP (Rose) protocol. A remote user can cause a denial of
    service by providing specially crafted facilities fields.

    which can be exploited my local users to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2011-1598

    Dave Jones reported an issue in the Broadcast Manager Controller Area
    Network (CAN/BCM) protocol that may allow local users to cause a NULL
    pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2011-1745

    Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.
    Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service due
    to missing bounds checking in the AGPIOC_BIND ioctl. On default Debian
    installations, this is exploitable only by users in the video group.

CVE-2011-1746

    Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.
    Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service
    due to missing bounds checking in the agp_allocate_memory and
    agp_create_user_memory. On default Debian installations, this is
    exploitable only by users in the video group.

CVE-2011-1748

    Oliver Kartkopp reported an issue in the Controller Area Network (CAN) raw
    socket implementation which permits ocal users to cause a NULL pointer
    dereference, resulting in a denial of service.
    
CVE-2011-1759

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the support for executing "old ABI"
    binaries on ARM processors. Local users can obtain elevated privileges due
    to insufficient bounds checking in the semtimedop system call.

CVE-2011-1767

    Alexecy Dobriyan reported an issue in the GRE over IP implementation.
    Remote users can cause a denial of service by sending a packet during
    module initialization.

    Remote users can cause a denial of service by sending a packet during
    module initialization.

CVE-2011-1776

    Timo Warns reported an issue in the Linux implementation for GUID
    partitions. Users with physical access can gain access to sensitive kernel
    memory by adding a storage device with a specially crafted corrupted
    invalid partition table.

CVE-2011-2022

    Vasiliy Kulikov reported an issue in the Linux support for AGP devices.
    Local users can obtain elevated privileges or cause a denial of service due
    to missing bounds checking in the AGPIOC_UNBIND ioctl. On default Debian
    installations, this is exploitable only by users in the video group.

CVE-2011-2182

    Ben Hutchings reported an issue with the fix for CVE-2011-1017 (see above)
    that made it insufficient to resolve the issue.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-26lenny3. Updates for arm and hppa are not yet available,
but will be released as soon as possible.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 5.0 (lenny)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.26-1um-2+26lenny3

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
These updates will not become active until after your system is rebooted.

Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: http://www.debian.org/security/
