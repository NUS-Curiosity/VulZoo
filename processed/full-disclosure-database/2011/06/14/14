-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing the
rcsL RIFF chunk within Director files. The logic within the DIRAPI.dll
module fails to account for a specific condition and can be made to
misallocate a buffer on the heap. By crafting specific values within
rcsL substructures an attacker can corrupt memory leading to arbitrary
code execution under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
