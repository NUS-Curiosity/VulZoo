-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Oracle Java Runtime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw exists within the way Java handles color profiles.
When parsing a color profile containing a invalid 'rcs2' tag, the
process can be forced to overflow an integer value during an arithmetic
operation. The newly calculated value is then used to allocate memory on
the heap. By providing specific values it is possible to cause a memory
corruption that can lead to remote code being executed under to user
running the browser.
