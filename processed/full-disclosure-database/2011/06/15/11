-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the CSWV chunk inside Adobe's RIFF-based
Director file format. When handling certain substructures, the code does
not properly ensure arithmetic operations will not exceed expected
values. By crafting a file with certain values this can be abused to
cause memory corruption which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code
under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
