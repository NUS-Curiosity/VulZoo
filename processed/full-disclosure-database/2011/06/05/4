Package        : oprofile
Vulnerability  : command injection
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 624212
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1760

OProfile is a performance profiling tool which is configurable by opcontrol, its
control utility. Stephane Chauveau reported several ways to inject arbitrary
commands in the arguments of this utility. If a local unprivileged user is
authorized by sudoers file to run opcontrol as root, this user could use the
flaw to escalate his privileges.
