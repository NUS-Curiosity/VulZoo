Subject: Medium severity flaw with Ark

I recently discovered that the Ark archiving tool is vulnerable to directory 
traversal via malformed.  When attempts are made to view files within the 
malformed Zip file in Ark's default view, the wrong file may be displayed due to 
incorrect construction of the temporary file name.  Whilst this does not allow 
the wrong file to be overwritten, after closing the default view, Ark will then
attempt to delete the temporary file which could result in the deletion of
the incorrect file.

After discussions with the vendor, CVE-2011-2725 was assigned to this 
vulnerability.
