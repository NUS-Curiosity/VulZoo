      Release date:       12 Oct 2011

      Technical details
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      The calendar synchronization feature of iOS fails to validate
      the SSL certificate provided by the server. Therefore, CalDAV
      communication can be intercepted by a basic man in the middle
      attack. As every request contains a HTTP basic authentication
      header, which contains base64-encoded credentials, it is
      possible to intercept email account credentials by an attacker
      that is suitably positioned (e.g. the same LAN, WLAN) or is
      able to tamper with DNS records pointing to the CalDAV server.
	
      The application accepts the untrusted certificate without any
      warning or prompt, so the attack will go unnoticed by the user.
