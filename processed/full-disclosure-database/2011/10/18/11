ZDI-11-295 : Apple QuickTime FlashPix JPEG Tables Selector Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-295
October 18, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3222

-- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

-- Affected Vendors:

Apple



-- Affected Products:

Apple Quicktime



-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Quicktime handles flashpix
files. When a flashpix contains a tile that has a Compression Type 0x2
(JPEG) and an 'JPEG tables selector' value that is bigger then the
global stream property 'Maximum JPEG table index', Quicktime will write
outside the global JPEG table. This corruption could lead to remote code
execution under the context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
