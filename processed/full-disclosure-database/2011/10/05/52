Package        : quagga
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3323 CVE-2011-3324 CVE-2011-3325 CVE-2011-3326 CVE-2011-3327

Riku Hietamaki, Tuomo Untinen and Jukka Taimisto discovered several
vulnerabilities in Quagga, an Internet routing daemon:

CVE-2011-3323
	A stack-based buffer overflow while decoding Link State Update
	packets with a malformed Inter Area Prefix LSA can cause the
	ospf6d process to crash or (potentially) execute arbitrary
	code.

CVE-2011-3324
	The ospf6d process can crash while processing a Database
	Description packet with a crafted Link-State-Advertisement.

CVE-2011-3325
	The ospfd process can crash while processing a crafted Hello
	packet.

CVE-2011-3326
	The ospfd process crashes while processing
	Link-State-Advertisements of a type not known to Quagga.

CVE-2011-3327
	A heap-based buffer overflow while processing BGP UPDATE
	messages containing an Extended Communities path attribute
	can cause the bgpd process to crash or (potentially) execute
	arbitrary code.

The OSPF-related vulnerabilities require that potential attackers send
packets to a vulnerable Quagga router; the packets are not distributed
over OSPF.  In contrast, the BGP UPDATE messages could be propagated
by some routers.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.10-1lenny6.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.17-2+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.19-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.
