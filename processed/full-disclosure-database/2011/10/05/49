Affected Products
=================

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco Catalyst
6500 Series ASA Services Module are affected by multiple
vulnerabilities. Affected versions of Cisco ASA Software will vary
depending on the specific vulnerability.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

For specific version information, refer to the Software Versions and
Fixes section of this advisory.

MSN IM Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
+------------------------------------------------

The MSN IM inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive
Security Appliances is affected by a DoS vulnerability.

MSN IM inspection is not enabled by default.

Administrators can enable MSN IM inspection and specify actions when
a message violates a parameter, create an IM inspection policy map.
You can then apply the inspection policy map when you enable IM
inspection, as shown in the following example:

    policy-map type inspect im MY-MSN-INSPECT
     parameters
     match protocol msn-im 
      log
    !
    policy-map global_policy
      class inspection_default
        inspect im MY-MSN-INSPECT

TACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
+------------------------------------------

An authentication bypass vulnerability affects the TACACS+
implementation of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.

In order to enable TACACS+ for authentication, authorization, or
accounting (AAA), you must first create at least one AAA server group
per AAA protocol and add one or more servers to each group with the
"aaa-server" command. You identify AAA server groups by name. The
following example shows how a AAA server group is configured for TACACS+
authentication:

    aaa-server my-tacacs-sever protocol tacacs+
    aaa-server my-tacacs-server (inside) host 203.0.113.11 

SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
+--------------------------------------------------

Four DoS vulnerabilities affect the SunRPC inspection feature of
Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.

SunRPC inspection is enabled by default.

To check if SunRPC inspection is enabled, issue the "show service-policy
| include sunrpc" command and confirm that output, such as what is
displayed in the following example, is returned.

    ciscoasa# show service-policy | include sunrpc
          Inspect: sunrpc, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0

The following configuration commands are used to enable SunRPC
inspection in the Cisco ASA.

    class-map inspection_default
     match default-inspection-traffic
    !
    policy-map global_policy
     class inspection_default
      ...
      inspect sunrpc 
      ...
    !
    service-policy global_policy global

ILS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
+---------------------------------------------

A DoS vulnerability affects the ILS inspection feature of Cisco ASA
5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.

ILS inspection is not enabled by default.

To check if ILS inspection is enabled, issue the "show service-policy |
include ils" command and confirm that output, such as what is displayed
in the following example, is returned.

    ciscoasa# show service-policy | include ils
          Inspect: ils, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0

The following configuration commands are used to enable ILS
inspection in the Cisco ASA.

    class-map inspection_default
     match default-inspection-traffic
    !
    policy-map global_policy
     class inspection_default
      ...
      inspect ils
      ...
    !
    service-policy global_policy global

How to Determine the Running Software Version
+--------------------------------------------

To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is
running on an appliance, administrators can issue the "show version"
command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive
Security Appliance that is running software version 8.4(1):

    ASA#show version | include Version
    Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1)
    Device Manager Version 6.4(1)

Customers who use Cisco ASDM to manage devices can locate the
software version in the table that is displayed in the login window
or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

With the exception of the Cisco FWSM, no other Cisco products are
currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco Catalyst
6500 Series ASA Services Module are affected by the following
vulnerabilities:

MSN IM Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
+------------------------------------------------

The IM inspect engine lets you apply fine grained controls on the IM
application to control the network usage and stop leakage of
confidential data, propagation of worms, and other threats to the
corporate network.

A DoS vulnerability affects the MSN IM inspection feature of Cisco
ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. During successful
exploitation, an unauthenticated attacker could cause the affected
device to reload and may result in a sustained DoS condition.

Note: Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability; traffic that
is destined to the appliance will not trigger the vulnerability. MSN IM
inspection is not enabled by default.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtl67486 and has been
assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3304.

TACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
+------------------------------------------

AAA enables the ASA to determine who the user is (authentication),
what the user can do (authorization), and what the user did
(accounting). The Cisco ASA supports TACACS+ authentication for VPN
users, firewall sessions, and administrative access to the device.

An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the TACACS+
implementation of the Cisco ASA. Successful exploitation could allow
a remote attacker to bypass TACACS+ authentication of VPN users,
firewall sessions, or administrative access to the device. The
attacker needs to have access to the network between the ASA and the
TACACS+ server in order to successfully exploit this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCto40365 and has been
assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3298.

SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities
+--------------------------------------------------

The Sun RPC inspection engine performs application inspection for the
Sun RPC protocol. Sun RPC is used by Network File System (NFS) and
Network Information Service (NIS). Sun RPC services can run on any
port. When a client attempts to access a Sun RPC service on a server,
it must learn the port that service is running on. The client does
this by querying the port mapper process, usually rpcbind, on the
well-known port of 111.

Four DoS vulnerabilities affect the SunRPC inspection feature of
Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, in which an
unauthenticated attacker may cause the affected device to reload.

Note:  Only transit traffic can trigger these vulnerabilities;
traffic that is destined to the appliance will not trigger the
vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by using UDP
packets, not TCP. SunRPC inspection is enabled by default.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCto92380,
CSCtq06065, CSCtq06062, CSCto92398; and have been assigned CVE IDs
CVE-2011-3299, CVE-2011-3300, CVE-2011-3301, and CVE-2010-3302,
respectively.

ILS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability
+---------------------------------------------

The ILS inspection engine provides NAT support for Microsoft
NetMeeting, SiteServer, and Active Directory products that use LDAP
to exchange directory information with an ILS server.

A DoS vulnerability affects the ILS inspection feature of Cisco ASA
5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. During successful
exploitation, an unauthenticated attacker could cause the affected
device to reload and may result in a sustained DoS condition.

Note:  Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability; traffic
that is destined to the appliance will not trigger the vulnerability.
ILS inspection is not enabled by default.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtq57697 and has been
assigned CVE CVE-2011-3303.

Vulnerability Scoring Details

Workarounds
===========

This Cisco Security Advisory describes multiple distinct
vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities and their respective
workarounds are independent of each other.

MSN Instant Messeger (IM) Inspection DoS Vulnerability
+-----------------------------------------------------

Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling MSN IM
inspection if it is not required. Administrators can disable MSN IM
inspection by issuing the "no inspect im" command in class configuration
sub-mode in the policy map configuration. Disabling MSN IM inspection
may cause MSN IM traffic to stop through the security appliance.

TACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
+------------------------------------------

There are no workarounds available for this vulnerability other than
using a different authentication protocol such as RADIUS, Active
Directory, etc.

SunRPC Inspection DoS Vulnerabilities
+------------------------------------

Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling SunRPC
inspection if it is not required. Administrators can disable SunRPC
inspection by issuing the "no inspect sunrpc" command in class
configuration sub-mode in the policy map configuration. Disabling
SunRPC inspection may cause SunRPC traffic to stop through the security
appliance.

ILS Inspection DoS Vulnerability
+-------------------------------

Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling ILS
inspection if it is not required. Administrators can disable
ILS inspection by issuing the "no inspect ils" command in class
configuration sub-mode in the policy map configuration. Disabling ILS
inspection may cause ILS traffic to stop through the security appliance.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature
sets they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing
or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be
bound by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml.

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
