Synopsis
========

Insecure usage of server provided filenames may allow the creation or
overwriting of local files.

Background
==========

GNU Wget is a free software package for retrieving files using HTTP,
HTTPS and FTP, the most widely-used Internet protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/wget               < 1.12-r2                 >= 1.12-r2

Description
===========

It was discovered that Wget was unsafely trusting server-provided
filenames. This allowed attackers to overwrite or create files on the
user's system by sending a redirect from the expected URL to another
URL specifying the targeted file.

Impact
======

An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to create or overwrite
local files by enticing the user to open an attacker controlled URL,
possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Wget users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/wget-1.12-r2"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since September 19, 2010. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
