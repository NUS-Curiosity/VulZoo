-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-2436

-- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

-- Affected Vendors:

Adobe



-- Affected Products:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required
to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the Adobe Image parsing library. When
Adobe Reader tries to parse an .IFF image. While it tries to copy the
image data from the RGBA chunk insufficient boundary checks are
performed on a row counter which could lead to a heap overflow. This
could result in remote code execution with the rights of the current user.
