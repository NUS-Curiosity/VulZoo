Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in GnuTLS, allowing for easier
man-in-the-middle attacks.

Background
==========

GnuTLS is an Open Source implementation of the TLS 1.2 and SSL 3.0
protocols.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-libs/gnutls              < 2.10.0                  >= 2.10.0

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GnuTLS. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

Impact
======

An attacker could perform man-in-the-middle attacks to spoof arbitrary
SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
Certification Authority or to inject an arbitrary amount of chosen
plaintext into the beginning of the application protocol stream,
allowing for further exploitation.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All GnuTLS users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/gnutls-2.10.0"

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since August 6, 2010. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.
