Subject: Xorg file permission change PoC (CVE-2011-4029)


Hi list,

A couple of weeks ago, I found a permission change vulnerability in 
the way that Xorg handled its lock files.  Once exploited, it allowed a
local user to modify the file permissions of an arbitrary file to 444 (read
for all).

It has been assigned CVE-2011-4029, X.org released a patch on 2011/10/18,
and now, I though I could share the vulnerability description and its
original PoC.
