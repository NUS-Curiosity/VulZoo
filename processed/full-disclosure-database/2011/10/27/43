October 27, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3249

-- CVSS:
9, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C

-- Affected Vendors:

Apple



-- Affected Products:

Apple Quicktime



-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way Quicktime decodes flic file.
Flic files can contain FLC Delta Decompression block containing Run
Length Encoded data. Quicktime fails to correctly checking the
decompression size when decoding the RLE data. This allowes for a 4 byte
overwrite past the end of the buffer which could result into remote code
execution under the context of the current user.
