ZDI-11-314 : Apple Quicktime PnPixPat PatType 3 Parsing Remote Code
Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-314
October 27, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3247

-- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

-- Affected Vendors:

Apple



-- Affected Products:

Apple Quicktime



-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple's QuickTime Player. User interaction
is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit
a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses a specific
opcode within a PCT file. When resizing a heap buffer, the application
will use a signed word read from the file to calculate the resulting
size. This can be used to force the target buffer to be of an undersized
length. Usage of this buffer will result in a buffer overflow in the
context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
