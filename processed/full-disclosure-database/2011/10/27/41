ZDI-11-312 : Apple QuickTime Atom Hierarachy Argument Size Mismatch
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

October 27, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-3221

-- CVSS:
7.5, AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P

-- Affected Vendors:

Apple



-- Affected Products:

Apple Quicktime



-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime Player. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within how the application parses the atom
hierarchy within a QuickTime movie file. In a certain situation the
application will pass execution to another function for handling the
atom, however, will pass the incorrect number of arguments. Due to this,
a variable will be treated as a pointer. This can lead to code execution
under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:

Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details
can be found at:
