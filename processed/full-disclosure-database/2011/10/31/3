Package        : phpldapadmin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 646754
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-4075 CVE-2011-4074

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpldapadmin, a web based
interface for administering LDAP servers. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-4074

  Input appended to the URL in cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to "_debug") is
  not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be
  exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser
  session in context of an affected site.

CVE-2011-4075

  Input passed to the "orderby" parameter in cmd.php (when "cmd" is set to
  "query_engine", "query" is set to "none", and "search" is set to e.g.
  "1") is not properly sanitised in lib/functions.php before being used in a
  "create_function()" function call. This can be exploited to inject and
  execute arbitrary PHP code.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0.5-6+lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0.5-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0.5-2.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpldapadmin packages.
