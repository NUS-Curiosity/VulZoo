Subject: Context IS Advisory - MS11-066 .NET 4 - Microsoft
	Chart Control

===============================ADVISORY===============================
Systems Affected:    .NET 4 - Microsoft Chart Control
Severity:            High
Category:            Information Disclosure
Author:              Context Information Security Ltd
Reported to vendor:  3rd October 2010
Advisory Issued:     11th August 2011
Reference:           MS11-066, CVE-2011-1977 
===============================ADVISORY===============================
 
Description
-----------
The Microsoft Chart Control is vulnerable to an information disclosure vulnerability. By sending a specific GET request to an application implementing the chart control, attackers could read arbitrary files on the system. 
 
Analysis
--------
The Microsoft Chart Control plots graphs and with the default configuration stores those as image files in a directory on the system. The graph images are retrieved using GET requests and a file path parameter. 
 
When the control retrieves a request, it verifies that the requested file path lies within the allowed directory and if so reads and returns the file’s contents. However, the verification process was found to be flawed, resulting in the ability to traverse directories to load arbitrary files.
 
The Microsoft Chart Control is included in the .NET Framework 4 or can be downloaded separately for .NET 3.5 (http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/mschart).
 
This vulnerability was found using the Context App Tool (CAT http://cat.contextis.com).
 
Technologies Affected
---------------------

Vendor Response
---------------
Microsoft advises users to patch the .Net Framework to the latest version.  See the following Microsoft security bulletin for more details:
