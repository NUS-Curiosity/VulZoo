Everyone must be also aware of the "Request-Range" except the "Range"
field in the header.

>>From the byterange source
(http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/branches/2.2.x/modules/http/byterange_filter.c)



    if (!(range = apr_table_get(r->headers_in, "Range"))) {
        range = apr_table_get(r->headers_in, "Request-Range");
    }


Advisories must take into account this case too.
