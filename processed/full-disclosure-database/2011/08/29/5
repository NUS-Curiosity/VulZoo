I am missing something while not feeling like explaining to dummies why cve sux.

Clearly the current thread drama was started by the publication of Kingcope's POC.

Zalewski might have something to do with this issue, I don't know.

The IETF RFC is so DOS friendly they have a ticket on it.

As of now (29.08.2011) apache d3v3lop3rs released an advisory not mentioning neither Kingcope nor Zalewski and citing the cve sh1t which is VIRTUALLY EMPTY as of now - check for yourself (citing empty stuff appears strange to me).

What did you try to explain or will I have to wait for bright times when usa is debt free?
