So that when two different people issue advisories about it, if they both say
CVE-2011-3192, we know it's the same issue.  Otherwise if you got some people
writing about Kingcope's hole with gzip and others writing about Zalewski's
hole with Range: it's hard to tell if they're really the same issue or not.
