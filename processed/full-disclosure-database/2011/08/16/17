-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the way RealPlayer handles DEFINEFONT
fields in Flash Files. When the process parses corrupt a ShapeRecord
with the DefineFont record it reads outside a stack buffer and uses a
random stack value as a heap pointer. Later this pointer will be used to
write data into. The resulting corruption can lead to remote code
execution under the context of the current user.
