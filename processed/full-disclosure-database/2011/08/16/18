-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists due to the fact that RealPlayer allows users to
run local HTML files with scripting enabled without any warning. The
RealPlayer ActiveX control can be scripted from a web browser to load
local HTML files. This can lead to remote code execution under the
context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
