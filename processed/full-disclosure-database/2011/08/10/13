Vendor/product description:
---------------------------
"SSL Network Extender (SNX) is a browser plug-in that provides
clientless remote access, while delivering full network connectivity
for any IP-based application."

URL: http://www.checkpoint.com/products/ssl_network_ext/

"Comprehensive Endpoint Security
Scans for spyware to ensure that malicious processes, keystroke
loggers, and Trojan horses are not installed on remote endpoints,
Connectra scans for these and other spyware through remote usersâ€™
browsers. By disabling spyware and enforcing baseline security
requirements before it grants SSL VPN access, Connectra stops identity
and password theft and prevents data loss."

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The client-side endpoint security solution (SSL Network Extender (SNX),
SecureWorkSpace and Endpoint Security On-Demand), e.g. supplied by a
Check Point Connectra or other Check Point security appliances on the
portal page, uses either a signed Java applet (called CShell or
Deployment Agent) or ActiveX control to perform local compliance scans
on the client.

Due to quality issues within the software, an attacker is able to access
insecure methods from the "trustworthy" Java applet or ActiveX control
and exploit those features to compromise all client systems that trust
the correctly signed Java applet or ActiveX control (e.g. all users
that need to use this software for accessing internal systems over
company VPN).

As SEC Consult does not provide free of charge quality assurance for
software vendors above providing information in advisories, no further
proof of concepts than this advisory / exploit have been created.


The Check Point Deployment agent Java applet or ActiveX control have a
"Secure Workspace" (SWS) feature which is provided per default in
"sws.jar" (or "sws.cab"). This JAR-file is extracted to %TEMP%\SWS
(Windows) or /tmp/SWS (Linux). It includes the executable CPSWS.exe and
some other XML and DLL files (side note: it is no workaround to remove
"sws.jar" on the company Check Point Connectra appliance as this file
can also remotely be deployed or fetched).

Calling the public method "CreatePackageURL" it is possible for an
attacker to load the SWS feature/package. Afterwards "RunPackageAction"
can be called to access the following actions of the "Secure Workspace"
component:
1) runExeStart
2) runCmd
3) setXmlFile
4) dwnldFile
5) createCmdFile

The proof of concept uses "dwnldFile" and "runCmd" to upload an
arbitrary executable file and store it as "CPSWS.exe" within the
temporary directory of the victim's client system. Then "runCmd" is
being called to automatically run the new malicious "CPSWS.exe" and
compromise the client system.

So it's not just possible to execute commands on the clients but also to
choose one's own arbitrary malicious payload.


==>>
Summing up, an attacker is able to upload arbitrary executable files to
remote clients and then immediately execute them without notice as a
signed Java applet / ActiveX is being used (if "Always trust content
from this publisher" has been checked - otherwise an unsuspicious Java
digital signature verification popup will occur).

Possible attack vectors are drive-by downloads just by visiting
malicious websites but also through emails, any XSS on unsuspicious
websites, etc.


Proof of concept:

has been created. It can be found at the following URL:
