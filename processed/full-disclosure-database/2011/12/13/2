Subject: New awstats.pl vulnerability?

For the past several days, I have been seeing thousands of requests
looking for awstats.pl like this one:

GET /awstats/awstats.pl ? configdir=|echo;echo YYYAAZ;uname;id;echo YYY;echo|

I am dropping these requests due to previous (and very old) issues
with awstats (see CVE-2006-3682).

But this leaves me wondering if there is a new vuln lurking here somewhere.

Anyone else seeing the same thing?

Regards,

Lamar Spells
