Package        : heimdal
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-4862

It was discovered that the Kerberos support for telnetd contains a
pre-authentication buffer overflow, which may enable remote attackers
who can connect to the Telnet to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.dfsg.1-2.1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0~git20100726.dfsg.1-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.
