Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java platform.  This combines the two previous
openjdk-6 advisories, DSA-2311-1 and DSA-2356-1.

CVE-2011-0862
	Integer overflow errors in the JPEG and font parser allow
	untrusted code (including applets) to elevate its privileges.

CVE-2011-0864
	Hotspot, the just-in-time compiler in OpenJDK, mishandled
	certain byte code instructions, allowing untrusted code
	(including applets) to crash the virtual machine.

CVE-2011-0865
	A race condition in signed object deserialization could
	allow untrusted code to modify signed content, apparently
	leaving its signature intact.

CVE-2011-0867
	Untrusted code (including applets) could access information
	about network interfaces which was not intended to be public.
	(Note that the interface MAC address is still available to
	untrusted code.)

CVE-2011-0868
	A float-to-long conversion could overflow, , allowing
	untrusted code (including applets) to crash the virtual
	machine.

CVE-2011-0869
	Untrusted code (including applets) could intercept HTTP
	requests by reconfiguring proxy settings through a SOAP
	connection.

CVE-2011-0871
	Untrusted code (including applets) could elevate its
	privileges through the Swing MediaTracker code.

CVE-2011-3389
	The TLS implementation does not guard properly against certain
	chosen-plaintext attacks when block ciphers are used in CBC
	mode.

CVE-2011-3521
	The CORBA implementation contains a deserialization
	vulnerability in the IIOP implementation, allowing untrusted
	Java code (such as applets) to elevate its privileges.

CVE-2011-3544
	The Java scripting engine lacks necessary security manager
	checks, allowing untrusted Java code (such as applets) to
	elevate its privileges.

CVE-2011-3547
	The skip() method in java.io.InputStream uses a shared buffer,
	allowing untrusted Java code (such as applets) to access data
	that is skipped by other code.

CVE-2011-3548
	The java.awt.AWTKeyStroke class contains a flaw which allows
	untrusted Java code (such as applets) to elevate its
	privileges.

CVE-2011-3551
	The Java2D C code contains an integer overflow which results
	in a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially allowing
	untrusted Java code (such as applets) to elevate its
	privileges.

CVE-2011-3552
	Malicous Java code can use up an excessive amount of UDP
	ports, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2011-3553
	JAX-WS enables stack traces for certain server responses by
	default, potentially leaking sensitive information.

CVE-2011-3554
	JAR files in pack200 format are not properly checked for
	errors, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution when
	unpacking crafted pack200 files.

CVE-2011-3556
	The RMI Registry server lacks access restrictions on certain
	methods, allowing a remote client to execute arbitary code.

CVE-2011-3557
	The RMI Registry server fails to properly restrict privileges
	of untrusted Java code, allowing RMI clients to elevate their
	privileges on the RMI Registry server.

CVE-2011-3560
	The com.sun.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection class does not perform
	proper security manager checks in the setSSLSocketFactory()
	method, allowing untrusted Java code to bypass security policy
	restrictions.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 6b18-1.8.10-0~lenny1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.
