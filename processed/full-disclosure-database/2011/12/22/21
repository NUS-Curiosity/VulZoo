Package        : lighttpd
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 652726
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-4362 CVE-2011-3389

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd, a small and fast
webserver with minimal memory footprint.

CVE-2011-4362

  Xi Wang discovered that the base64 decoding routine which is used to
  decode user input during an HTTP authentication, suffers of a signedness
  issue when processing user input.  As a result it is possible to force
  lighttpd to perform an out-of-bounds read which results in Denial of
  Service conditions.

CVE-2011-3389

  When using CBC ciphers on an SSL enabled virtual host to communicate with
  certain client, a so called "BEAST" attack allows man-in-the-middle
  attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP traffic via a blockwise
  chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session.  Technically this is
  no lighttpd vulnerability.  However, lighttpd offers a workaround to
  mitigate this problem by providing a possibility to disable CBC ciphers.

  This updates includes this option by default. System administrators
  are advised to read the NEWS file of this update (as this may break older
  clients).


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.19+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.30-1.


We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.
