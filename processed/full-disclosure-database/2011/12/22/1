    pfSense x509 Insecure Certificate Creation

Advisory ID: MATTA-2011-001
CVE reference: CVE-2011-4197
Affected platforms: pfSense
Version: 2.0
Date: 2011-October-09
Security risk: High
Vulnerability: x509 Insecure Certificate Creation
Researcher: Florent Daigniere

Vulnerability Disclosure Policy:

Permanent URL:

=====================================================================
Description:

Certificates issued by the builtin PKI mechanism of pfSense prior
 to version 2.0.1 set the basic constraint CA:true to all
 certificates issued.

=====================================================================
Impact

Any user in possession of a certificate issued by the builtin PKI can
 issue sub-certificates with arbitrary CNs, bypassing potential access
 controls. Specifics depend on what the certificates are being
 used for.

=====================================================================
Versions affected:

Firmware version 2.0 tested.

=====================================================================
Threat mitigation

Revoke existing certificates and re-issue them without the basic
 constraint set.

To verify the purpose of your certificates, you can use the
 following command:

$openssl x509 -in test.crt -noout -purpose|grep CA
SSL client CA : Yes
SSL server CA : Yes
Netscape SSL server CA : Yes
S/MIME signing CA : Yes
S/MIME encryption CA : Yes
CRL signing CA : Yes
Any Purpose CA : Yes
OCSP helper CA : Yes
Time Stamp signing CA : Yes
