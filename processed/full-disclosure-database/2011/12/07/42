- -- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell Zenworks Asset Management.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The flaw exists within the rtrlet component. This process listens on TCP
port 8080. When handling an unauthenticated file upload the process does
not properly sanitize the path. Directory traversal can be used to drop
a file in an arbitrary location and a null byte inserted into the
filename to provide arbitrary extension. A remote attacker can exploit
this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of SYSTEM.
