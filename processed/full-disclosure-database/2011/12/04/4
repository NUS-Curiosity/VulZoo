Debian Bug     : 609534

Jon Larimer from IBM X-Force Advanced Research discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in the DVI backend of the evince document viewer:

CVE-2010-2640

    Insuficient array bounds checks in the PK fonts parser could lead
    to function pointer overwrite, causing arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2010-2641

    Insuficient array bounds checks in the PK fonts parser could lead
    to function pointer overwrite, causing arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2010-2642

    Insuficient bounds checks in the AFM fonts parser when writing
    data to a memory buffer allocated on heap could lead to arbitrary
    memory overwrite and arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2010-2643

    Insuficient check on an integer used as a size for memory
    allocation can lead to arbitrary write outside the allocated range
    and cause arbitrary code execution.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.22.2-4~lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), CVE-2010-2640, CVE-2010-2641
and CVE-2010-2643 have been fixed in version 2.30.3-2 but the fix for
CVE-2010-2642 was incomplete. The final fix is present in version
2.30.3-2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your evince packages.
