Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco ISE prior to release
1.0.4.MR2. This applies to both the hardware appliance and the
software-only versions of the product.

The following methods can be used to determine which Cisco ISE
release is installed:

  * From the Cisco ISE command-line interface (CLI), issue the show
    application version ise command, as shown in the following
    example:
   
        ise-node1/admin# show application version ise
        
        Cisco Identity Services Engine
        ---------------------------------------------
        Version      : 1.0.4.558
        Build Date   : Thu 18 Aug 2011 04:41:15 PM EST
        Install Date : Fri 16 Sep 2011 01:38:48 PM EST  
        
        
        ise-node1/admin#
   
    Based on the output of the show application version ise on the
    previous example, the installed Cisco ISE release is 1.0.4.588.
   
  * On the main login page of the Cisco ISE web-based interface, the
    version information is displayed under the "Identity Services
    Engine" heading.
  * From the Cisco ISE web-based interface, log in and click on the
    "Help" button located at the bottom left corner of the screen.
    From the resulting menu, select "About Identity Services Engine".
    Version information is displayed on the resulting window under
    the "Identity Services Engine" heading.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

The Cisco Identity Services Engine provides an attribute-based access
control solution that combines authentication, authorization, and
accounting (AAA); posture; profiling; and guest management services
on a single platform. Administrators can centrally create and manage
access control policies for users and endpoints in a consistent
fashion, and gain end-to-end visibility into everything that is
connected to the network.

The Cisco ISE contains a set of default credentials for its
underlying database. A remote attacker could use those credentials to
modify the device configuration and settings or gain complete
administrative control of the device.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

This vulnerability is fixed in software release 1.0.4.MR2, which will
be available on September 30th, 2011.

Cisco ISE release 1.0.4.MR2 will be made available in two formats:

  * as an ISO image containing a complete installation image, which
    can be used for a new install or for completely reimaging an
    existing installation.
  * as an application bundle that can be used to upgrade an existing
    Cisco ISE release 1.0 (1.0.3.377) or Cisco ISE release 1.0MR
    (1.0.4.558) installation to Cisco ISE release 1.0.4.MR2.

Those files can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com
by visiting http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html 
The files will be accessible using the following path:

Products > Security > Identity Management > Cisco Identity Services
Engine > Cisco Identity Services Engine Software 1.0 > Identity
Services Engine System Software-1.0 MR

On installation, either as a clean install from the ISO image or
application bundle for upgrading an existing install, Cisco ISE
release 1.0.4.MR2 will:

  * remove the existing database default credentials, and
  * request the user to provide new database credentials

Workarounds
===========

There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion
