Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2011-2818

   Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
   vectors related to display box rendering.


CVE-2011-2800

   Google Chrome before allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive
   information about client-side redirect targets via a crafted web site.


CVE-2011-2359

   Google Chrome does not properly track line boxes during rendering, which
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
   unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a "stale pointer."


Several unauthorised SSL certificates have been found in the wild issued
for the DigiNotar Certificate Authority, obtained through a security
compromise with said company.
This update blacklists SSL certificates issued by DigiNotar-controlled
intermediate CAs used by the Dutch PKIoverheid program.
