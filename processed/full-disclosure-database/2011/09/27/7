4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Novell GroupWise,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a vulnerable 
system.

The vulnerability is caused by an integer truncation error in 
NgwiCalVTimeZoneBody::ParseSelf() within gwwww1.dll when GroupWise 
Internet Agent parses "TZNAME" variables in VCALENDAR data. This can 
be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially 
crafted e-mail containing an overly long "TZNAME" property value.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.

5) Solution 

Update to version 8.02 Hot Patch 3.
