Package        : bcfg2
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 640028
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-3211

It has been discovered that the bcfg2 server, a configuration management
server for bcfg2 clients, is not properly sanitizing input from bcfg2
clients before passing it to various shell commands.  This enables an
attacker in control of a bcfg2 client to execute arbitrary commands on
the server with root privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.5.7-1.1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-3+squeeze1

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your bcfg2 packages.
