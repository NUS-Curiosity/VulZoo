Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Session Initiation
Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110928-sip

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 September 28 1600 UTC (GMT)

+--------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) implementation in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software
that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a
reload of an affected device or trigger memory leaks that may result
in system instabilities. Affected devices would need to be configured
to process SIP messages for these vulnerabilities to be exploitable.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds for devices that must run
SIP; however, mitigations are available to limit exposure to the
vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-sip.shtml.

Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories. Nine of the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that
correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as
well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities
in the September 2011 Bundled Publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual
Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the
following link:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep11.html

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) is affected by one of the
vulnerabilities described in this advisory. A separate Cisco Security
Advisory has been published to disclose the vulnerability that affects
the Cisco Unified Communications Manager at the following location:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-cucm.shtml

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco devices are affected when they are running affected Cisco IOS
Software and Cisco IOS XE Software versions that are configured to
process SIP messages.

Recent versions of Cisco IOS Software do not process SIP messages by
default. Creating a dial peer by issuing the "dial-peer voice"
configuration command will start the SIP processes, causing the Cisco
IOS device to process SIP messages. In addition, several features in
Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express, such as ephones, will
automatically start the SIP process when they are configured, which
could cause the affected device to start processing SIP messages. An
example of an affected configuration follows:

    dial-peer voice <Voice dial-peer tag> voip
     ...
    !

In addition to inspecting the Cisco IOS device configuration for a
"dial-peer" command that causes the device to process SIP messages,
administrators can also use the "show processes | include SIP" command
to determine whether Cisco IOS Software is running the processes that
handle SIP messages. In the following example, the presence of the
processes CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET or CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET indicates that the Cisco
IOS device will process SIP messages:

    Router# show processes | include SIP
     149 Mwe 40F48254            4          1    400023108/24000  0 CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET
     150 Mwe 40F48034            4          1    400023388/24000  0 CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET

Note: Because there are several ways a device running Cisco IOS Software
can start processing SIP messages, the "show processes | include SIP"
command should be used to determine whether the device is processing SIP
messages instead of relying on the presence of specific configuration
commands.

Cisco Unified Border Element images are also affected by two of these
vulnerabilities.

Note: The Cisco Unified Border Element feature (previously known as
the Cisco Multiservice IP-to-IP Gateway) is a special Cisco IOS
Software image that runs on Cisco multiservice gateway platforms.
This feature provides a network-to-network interface point for
billing, security, call admission control, quality of service, and
signaling interworking.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of
C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:

    Router> show version
    Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release
naming conventions is available in the white paper Cisco
IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide available at
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html.

Cisco IOS XE Software is affected by these vulnerabilities.

Note: Cisco Unified Communications Manager is affected by one of the
vulnerabilities described in this advisory. A separate Cisco Security
Advisory has been published to disclose the vulnerability that affects
the Cisco Unified Communications Manager at the following location:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-cucm.shtml

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The SIP application layer gateway (ALG), which is used by the Cisco
IOS Network Address Translation (NAT) and firewall features of Cisco
IOS Software, is not affected by these vulnerabilities.

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by these vulnerabilities.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

SIP is a popular signaling protocol that is used to manage voice and
video calls across IP networks such as the Internet. SIP is
responsible for handling all aspects of call setup and termination.
Voice and video are the most popular types of sessions that SIP
handles, but the protocol has the flexibility to accommodate other
applications that require call setup and termination. SIP call
signaling can use UDP (port 5060), TCP (port 5060), or Transport
Layer Security (TLS; TCP port 5061) as the underlying transport
protocol.

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the SIP implementation in Cisco IOS
Software that could allow a remote attacker to cause an affected
device to reload or to trigger memory leaks that may result in system
instabilities. These vulnerabilities are triggered when the device
that is running Cisco IOS Software processes crafted SIP messages.
Only traffic destined to the device can trigger the vulnerabilities;
transit SIP traffic is not an exploit vector.

Note: In cases where SIP is running over TCP transport, a TCP
three-way handshake is necessary to exploit these vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities are as follow:

CSCth03022 may cause a reload of an affected device. This vulnerability
has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID
CVE-2011-0939.

CSCti48504 may cause memory leaks. This vulnerability has been assigned
CVE ID CVE-2011-3275.

CSCto88686 may cause memory leaks or reloads of affected devices. This
vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-2072.

Note: this vulnerability also affects Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. The corresponding Cisco bug ID is CSCtl86047. Refer to the
separate Cisco Security Advisory for the Cisco Unified Communications
Manager for additional details.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities in this advisory may
result in system instabilities or a reload of an affected device.
Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Additionally, the Cisco IOS Software Checker is available on
the Cisco Security Intelligence Operations (SIO) portal at
http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x. It provides
several features for checking which Security Advisories affect specified
versions of Cisco IOS Software.

Cisco IOS XR System Software
+---------------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by any of the vulnerabilities
in the September 2011 bundled publication.

Workarounds
===========

If the affected Cisco IOS device requires SIP for VoIP services, SIP
cannot be disabled and no workarounds are available. Users are
advised to apply mitigation techniques to help limit exposure to the
vulnerabilities. Mitigation consists of allowing only legitimate
devices to connect to affected devices. To increase effectiveness,
the mitigation must be coupled with measures against spoofing on the
network edge. This action is required because SIP can use UDP as the
transport protocol.

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the companion
document "Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin:Identifying and
Mitigating Exploitation of the Multiple Vulnerabilities
in Cisco Voice Products" at the following location:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20110928-voice.shtml.

Disabling SIP Listening Ports
+----------------------------

For devices that do not require SIP to be enabled, the simplest and
most effective workaround is to disable SIP processing on the device.
Some versions of Cisco IOS Software allow administrators to disable
SIP with the following commands:

    sip-ua
     no transport udp
     no transport tcp
     no transport tcp tls

Warning: When applying this workaround to devices that are processing
Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or H.323 calls, the device will
not stop SIP processing while active calls are being processed. Under
these circumstances, this workaround should be implemented during a
maintenance window when active calls can be briefly stopped.

The "show udp connections", "show tcp brief all", and "show processes |
include SIP" commands can be used to confirm that the SIP UDP and TCP
ports are closed after applying this workaround.

Depending on the Cisco IOS Software version in use, when SIP is
disabled, the output from the "show ip sockets" command may still show
the SIP ports open, but sending traffic to them will cause the SIP
process to display the following message:

    *Jun 2 11:36:47.691: sip_udp_sock_process_read: SIP UDP Listener is DISABLED

Control Plane Policing
+---------------------

For devices that need to offer SIP services, it is possible to use
Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to block SIP traffic to the device from
untrusted sources. Cisco IOS Releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T,
12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP may be configured on a
device to protect the management and control planes to minimize the
risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly
permitting only authorized traffic sent to infrastructure devices in
accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The
following example can be adapted to specific network configurations:

    !-- The 192.168.1.0/24 network and the 172.16.1.1 host are trusted.
    !-- Everything else is not trusted. The following access list is used
    !-- to determine what traffic needs to be dropped by a control plane
    !-- policy (the CoPP feature): if the access list matches (permit)
    !-- then traffic will be dropped and if the access list does not
    !-- match (deny) then traffic will be processed by the router.
    access-list 100 deny udp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5061
    access-list 100 deny udp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060
    access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5061
    access-list 100 permit udp any any eq 5060
    access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5060
    access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5061

    !-- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4
    !-- traffic in accordance with existing security policies and
    !-- configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent
    !-- to infrastructure devices.
    !-- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by
    !-- the CoPP feature.
    class-map match-all drop-sip-class
      match access-group 100

    !-- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the
    !-- Control-Plane of the device.
    policy-map control-plane-policy
     class drop-sip-class
      drop

    !-- Apply the Policy-Map to the Control-Plane of the
    !-- device.
    control-plane
     service-policy input control-plane-policy

Note: Because SIP can use UDP as a transport protocol, it is possible
to spoof the source address of an IP packet, which may bypass access
control lists that permit communication to these ports from trusted
IP addresses.

In the preceding CoPP example, the access control entries (ACEs) that
match the potential exploit packets with the permit action cause these
packets to be discarded by the policy-map drop function, whereas
packets that match the deny action (not shown) are not affected by the
policy-map drop function. Additional information on the configuration
and use of the CoPP feature can be found at
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/coppwp_gs.html and
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gtrtlimt.html.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
