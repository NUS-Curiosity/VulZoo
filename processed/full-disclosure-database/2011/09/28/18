Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco IOS Software Data-Link Switching
Vulnerability

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110928-dlsw

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 September 28 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IOS Software contains a memory leak vulnerability in the
Data-Link Switching (DLSw) feature that could result in a device
reload when processing crafted IP Protocol 91 packets.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this
vulnerability.

This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110928-dlsw.shtml.

Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory
bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories. Nine of the
advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that
correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as
well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities
in the September 2011 Bundled Publication.

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual
Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the
following link:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep11.html

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Cisco IOS devices with the DLSw promiscuous feature enabled are affected
by the vulnerability described in this advisory. Devices with the DLSw
promiscuous feature enabled contain a line in the configuration defining
a local DLSw peer with the promiscuous keyword. This configuration
can be observed by issuing the command "show running-config". Systems
configured with the DLSw promiscuous feature enabled contain a line
similar to one of the following:

    dlsw local-peer promiscuous

or

    dlsw local-peer peer-id <IP address> promiscuous

To determine the software that runs on a Cisco IOS device, log in to
the device and issue the "show version" command to display the system
banner. Cisco IOS Software identifies itself as "Cisco Internetwork
Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." Other Cisco devices
do not have the "show version" command or give different output.

The following example shows output from a device running IOS version
15.0(1)M1:

    Router> show version
    Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

DLSw provides a means of transporting IBM Systems Network
Architecture (SNA) and network BIOS (NetBIOS) traffic over an IP
network. The Cisco implementation of DLSw over Fast Sequence
Transport (FST) uses IP Protocol 91. The promiscuous DLSw feature
permits the local peer to establish connection with remote peers that
are not statically configured.

A Cisco IOS device that is configured for DLSw listens for IP
protocol 91 packets. Depending on the DLSw configuration, UDP port
2067, and, one or more TCP ports can also be opened. The
vulnerability described in this document can only be exploited via IP
Protocol 91 and can not be exploited using either the UDP or TCP
transports.

Devices with only statically configured DLSw peers are not affected
by this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCth69364 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-0945.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerability in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may result in a memory
leak that can lead to a denial of service condition. Memory
exhaustion can cause an affected Cisco IOS device to reload or become
unresponsive; a power cycle might be required to recover from the
condition.

To identify the memory leak caused by this vulnerability, issue the
"show dlsw peers | include FST.*DISCONN" command; a monotonically
increasing list of FST peers that remain in the DISCONN state indicates
that memory is being held, as shown in the following example:

    Router> show dlsw peers | include FST.*DISCONN
    FST 176.74.146.194  DISCONN          1         0  prom      0    -   -        -
    FST 9.180.128.186   DISCONN          1         0  prom      0    -   -        -
    FST 139.71.105.39   DISCONN          1         0  prom      0    -   -        -
    FST 138.150.39.18   DISCONN          1         0  prom      0    -   -        -
    FST 253.240.220.167 DISCONN          1         0  prom      0    -   -        -
    FST 252.186.119.224 DISCONN          1         0  prom      0    -   -        -
    FST 41.255.172.252  DISCONN          1         0  prom      0    -   -        -

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Additionally, the Cisco IOS Software Checker is available on
the Cisco Security Intelligence Operations (SIO) portal at
http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x. It provides
several features for checking which Security Advisories affect specified
versions of Cisco IOS Software.

Cisco IOS XR Software
+--------------------

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by any of the vulnerabilities
in the September 2011 bundled publication.

Workarounds
===========

This vulnerability can be mitigated by using Control Plane Policing
(CoPP) to only allow IP Protocol 91 packets sent by valid peers.

Mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco devices within
the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin
companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20110928-dlsw.shtml

Control Plane Policing
+---------------------

Control Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block untrusted IP
Protocol 91 packets sent to the affected device. Cisco IOS Software
Releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the
CoPP feature. CoPP may be configured on a device to protect the
management and control planes to minimize the risk and effectiveness
of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting, and if
configured, rate-limiting only authorized traffic that is sent to
infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies
and configurations. The following example, which uses 192.168.100.1
to represent a trusted host, can be adapted to your network.

    !-- Deny FST traffic on IP protocol 91 from trusted
    !-- hosts to all IP addresses configured on all interfaces of the affected device
    !-- so that it will be allowed by the CoPP feature

    access-list 111 deny 91 host 192.168.100.1 any

    !-- Permit all other FST traffic on IP protocol 91
    !-- sent to all IP addresses configured on all interfaces of the affected
    !-- device so that it will be policed and dropped by the CoPP feature

    access-list 111 permit 91 any any

    !-- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3
    !-- and Layer4 traffic in accordance with existing security
    !-- policies and configurations for traffic that is authorized
    !-- to be sent to infrastructure devices

    !-- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by
    !-- the CoPP feature

    class-map match-all drop-fst-91-class
      match access-group 111

    !-- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the
    !-- Control-Plane of the device.

    policy-map input-CoPP-policy
      class drop-fst-91-class
        drop


    !-- Apply the Policy-Map to the Control-Plane of the
    !-- device

    control-plane
      service-policy input input-CoPP-policy


In the above CoPP example, the access control list entries (ACEs)
that match the potential exploit packets with the "permit" action
result in these packets being discarded by the policy map "drop"
function, while packets that match the deny action (not shown) are
not affected by the policy-map drop function. Note that in the 12.2S
and 12.0S Cisco IOS trains the policy-map syntax is different, as
shown in the following example:

    policy-map input-CoPP-policy
      class drop-fst-91-class
        police 32000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action drop

Additional information on the CoPP feature is available at: Control
Plane Policing Implementation Best Practices.

prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------
