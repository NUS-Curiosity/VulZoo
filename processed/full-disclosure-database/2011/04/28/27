-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL into
the backend database on vulnerable installations of Cisco Unified CM.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the Call Manager component. The system
exposes an Apache webserver which contains a JSP script vulnerable to
SQL injection. The xmldirectorylist.jsp file does not properly validate
the f, l, and n parameters before passing them to the database. A remote
attacker can abuse this to inject SQL statements to be evaluated by the
underlying database.

-- Vendor Response:
Cisco has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
