Package        : tgt
Vulnerability  : double free
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0001

Emmanuel Bouillon discovered a double free in tgt, the Linux SCSI target 
user-space tools, which could lead to denial of service.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) doesn't include tgt.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.4-2squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.4-3

We recommend that you upgrade your tgt packages.
