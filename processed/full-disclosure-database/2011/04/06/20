Seems a tad buggy in the mitigation section:

new_host_name=${new_host_name//[^a-zA-Z0-9]/}

I suspect they wanted:

new_host_name=${new_host_name//[^-.a-zA-Z0-9]/}

Otherwise if a valid dhcp server hands you foo.bar.baz.example.com your hostname
just became foobarbazexamplecom - whoops.  Oh, and - just because that's valid in a
hostname too...
