        CVE Name      CVE-2011-1507                                           

   Description On systems that have the Asterisk Manager Interface, Skinny,   
               SIP over TCP, or the built in HTTP server enabled, it is       
               possible for an attacker to open as many connections to        
               asterisk as he wishes. This will cause Asterisk to run out of  
               available file descriptors and stop processing any new calls.  
               Additionally, disk space can be exhausted as Asterisk logs     
               failures to open new file descriptors.                         

   Resolution Asterisk can now limit the number of unauthenticated            
              connections to each vulnerable interface and can also limit the 
              time unauthenticated clients will remain connected for some     
              interfaces. This will prevent vulnerable interfaces from using  
              up all available file descriptors. Care should be taken when    
              setting the connection limits so that the combined total of     
              allowed unauthenticated sessions from each service is not more  
              than the file descriptor limit for the Asterisk process. The    
              file descriptor limit can be checked (and set) using the        
              "ulimit -n" command for the process' limit and the              
              "/proc/sys/fs/file-max" file (on Linux) for the system's limit. 
                                                                              
              It will still be possible for an attacker to deny service to    
              each of the vulnerable services individually. To mitigate this  
              risk, vulnerable services should be run behind a firewall that  
              can detect and prevent DoS attacks.                             
                                                                              
              In addition to using a firewall to filter traffic, vulnerable   
              systems can be protected by disabling the vulnerable services   
              in their respective configuration files.
