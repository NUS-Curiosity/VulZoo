-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers directory traversal on
vulnerable installations of HP OpenView Data Protector. Authentication
is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

This specific flaw exists in the Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe).
The Backup Client Service listens on TCP port 5555 for communications
between systems in the cell. The process has insufficient sanitization
on user-supplied data when handling certain messages. Remote,
unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending
crafted filename strings to the target, which would allow attackers to
view or download arbitrary files on the target system.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
