Package        : request-tracker3.6, request-tracker3.8
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1685 CVE-2011-1686 CVE-2011-1687 CVE-2011-1688 
                 CVE-2011-1689 CVE-2011-1690

Several vulnerabilities were in Request Tracker, an issue tracking
system.

CVE-2011-1685
    If the external custom field feature is enabled, Request Tracker
    allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code with the
    permissions of the web server, possible triggered by a cross-site
    request forgery attack.  (External custom fields are disabled by
    default.)

CVE-2011-1686
    Multiple SQL injection attacks allow authenticated users to obtain
    data from the database in an unauthorized way.

CVE-2011-1687
    An information leak allows an authenticated privileged user to
    obtain sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords, via the
    search interface.

CVE-2011-1688
    When running under certain web servers (such as Lighttpd), Request
    Tracker is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing
    attackers to read any files accessible to the web server.  Request
    Tracker instances running under Apache or Nginx are not affected.

CVE-2011-1689
    Request Tracker contains multiple cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities.

CVE-2011-1690
    Request Tracker enables attackers to redirect authentication
    credentials supplied by legitimate users to third-party servers.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.6.7-5+lenny6 of the request-tracker3.6 package.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.8.8-7+squeeze1 of the request-tracker3.8 package.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.8.10-1 of the
request-tracker3.8 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your Request Tracker packages.
