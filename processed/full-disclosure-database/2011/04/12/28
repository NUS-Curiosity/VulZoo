-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the application's parsing of a
particular record within a Microsoft Excel Compound Document. When
specifying a particular value, the application will fail to initialize a
variable that is used as the length of a memcpy operation. Due to the
usage of the uninitialized value, with proper control of the program
flow an attacker can force a length of their own choosing for the memcpy
operation. This will cause a buffer overflow and can lead to code
execution under the context of the application.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
