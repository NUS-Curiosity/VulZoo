RealNetworks

-- Affected Products:

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Helix Server products. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the rmserver.exe process. This process
is active by default on all Helix Server installations. Due to a failure
to properly sanitize the contents of the 'x-wap-profile' header, it is
possible to provide malicious data that is passed directly to a format
string function. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to
execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
RealNetworks has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
