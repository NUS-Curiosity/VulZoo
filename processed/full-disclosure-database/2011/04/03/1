Several vulnearbilities were discovered in the TIFF manipulation and
conversion library:

CVE-2011-0191

  A buffer overflow allows to execute arbitrary code or cause
  a denial of service via a crafted TIFF image with JPEG encoding.
  This issue affects the Debian 5.0 Lenny package only.

  a denial of service via a crafted TIFF Internet Fax image
  file that has been compressed using CCITT Group 4 encoding.

CVE-2011-1167

  Heap-based buffer overflow in the thunder (aka ThunderScan)
  decoder allows to execute arbitrary code via a TIFF file that
  has an unexpected BitsPerSample value.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been
fixed in version 3.8.2-11.4.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been
fixed in version 3.9.4-5+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution, the first two problems have been fixed
in version 3.9.4-8, the last problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.9.4-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.
