perl vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 11.04
- Ubuntu 10.10
- Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

Summary:

An attacker could send crafted input to Perl and bypass intended
restrictions.

Software Description:
- perl: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language

Details:

It was discovered that the Safe.pm Perl module incorrectly handled
Safe::reval and Safe::rdo access restrictions. An attacker could use this
flaw to bypass intended restrictions and possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2010-1168, CVE-2010-1447)

It was discovered that the CGI.pm Perl module incorrectly handled certain
MIME boundary strings. An attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary
HTTP headers and perform HTTP response splitting and cross-site scripting
attacks. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 10.04 LTS and
10.10. (CVE-2010-2761, CVE-2010-4411)

It was discovered that the CGI.pm Perl module incorrectly handled newline
characters. An attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary HTTP
headers and perform HTTP response splitting and cross-site scripting
attacks. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 10.04 LTS and
10.10. (CVE-2010-4410)

It was discovered that the lc, lcfirst, uc, and ucfirst functions did not
properly apply the taint attribute when processing tainted input. An
attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended restrictions. This issue
only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 10.04 LTS and 10.10. (CVE-2011-1487)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 11.04:
  perl                            5.10.1-17ubuntu4.1

Ubuntu 10.10:
  perl                            5.10.1-12ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS:
  perl                            5.10.1-8ubuntu2.1

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS:
  perl                            5.8.8-12ubuntu0.5

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS:
  perl                            5.8.7-10ubuntu1.3
