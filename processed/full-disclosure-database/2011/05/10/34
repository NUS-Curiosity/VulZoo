Package        : zodb
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-0668 CVE-2009-0669 
Debian Bug     : 540465

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in python-zodb, a set of
tools for using ZODB, that could lead to arbitrary code execution in the worst
case. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identified the following
problems:

CVE-2009-0668

   The ZEO server doesn't restrict the callables when unpickling data
   received from a malicious client which can be used by an attacker to execute
   arbitrary python code on the server by sending certain exception pickles. This
   also allows an attacker to import any importable module as ZEO is importing the
   module containing a callable specified in a pickle to test for a certain flag.

CVE-2009-0669

   Due to a programming error an authorization method in the StorageServer
   component of ZEO was not used as an internal method. This allows a malicious
   client to bypass authentication when connecting to a ZEO server by simply
   calling this authorization method.

The update also limits the number of new object ids a client can request
to 100 as it would be possible to consume huge amounts of resources by
requesting a big batch of new object ids. No CVE id has been assigned to this.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.6.0-2+lenny3.

The stable distribution (squeeze) is not affected, it was fixed before
the initial release.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.8.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zodb packages.
