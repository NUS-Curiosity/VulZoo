9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within Firefox's handling of observer OBJECTs.
If an observer OBJECT is removed from the mObserverList during an
iteration of LOOP_OVER_OBSERVERS macro, one can heap spray over
|mObserverList.mNext| and
change the execution flow. This would allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.

-- Vendor Response:
Mozilla has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
