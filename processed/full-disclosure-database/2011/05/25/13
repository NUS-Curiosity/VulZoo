Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco RVS4000 and WRVS4400N Web Management
Interface Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110525-rvs4000

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 May 25 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Routers and Cisco WRVS4400N
Wireless-N Gigabit Security Routers have several web interface
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated
user.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110525-rvs4000.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
- -------------------

These vulnerabilities affect the following devices running firmware
prior to the first fixed release documented in the Software Versions
and Fixes section of this advisory:

  * Cisco RVS4000 Gigabit Security Router (v1 and v2)
  * Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router (V1.0, V1.1,
    and V2)
    Note: The Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router V1.0
    and V1.1 have reached end of life, and no further firmware
    updates are being made available.

To check the version of system firmware that is running on the device,
log into the device with the web management interface, and navigate to
the screen: Setup --> Summary. Under "System Information" is a field
labeled "Firmware Version:". The number directly beside this field label
is the system firmware version. An example would be V1.3.0.3.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
- ---------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco RVS4000 and WRVS4400N Gigabit Security Routers deliver
high-speed network access and IPsec VPN capabilities for small
businesses. They also provides firewall and intrusion prevention
capabilities.

The Cisco RVS4000 and WRVS4400N Gigabit Security Routers contain
three web management interface vulnerabilities:

  * Retrieval of the configuration file
    If an administrator of the device has previously created a backup
    of the configuration, using Administration --> Backup & Restore
    --> Backup, it is possible for a remote unauthenticated user to
    access the backup configuration file. This file contains all
    configuration parameters of the device, including the HTTP
    authentication password and VPN pre-shared-keys (PSKs).

  * Root operating system arbitrary command injection by an
    authenticated attacker
    A user who is authenticated to the device can inject arbitrary
    commands into the underlying operating system with root
    privileges, via the ping test and traceroute test parameters.

  * Retrieval of admin SSL certificate private key
    The admin SSL certificate private and public keys can be
    retrieved (used for Quick VPN) by a remote unauthenticated user.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtn23871 and has
been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs:

  * CVE-2011-1645: Retrieval of the configuration file
  * CVE-2011-1646: Root operating system arbitrary command injection
    by an authenticated attacker
  * CVE-2011-1647: Retrieval of admin SSL certificate private key

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may result in
execution of arbitrary commands on the device by an authenticated
user or retrieval of configuration files and private keys by an
unauthenticated user.

The configuration files contain sensitive information in text, such
as the HTTP passwords and PSKs. The retrieval of the certificates may
aid in further attacks.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to determine
exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Small Business Support Center or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

These vulnerabilities have been fixed in the following firmware

Workarounds
===========

The following mitigations help limit the exposure to these
vulnerabilities.

  * Disable remote management
    Caution: Do not disable remote management if you manage the
    device via the WAN connection. Doing so will result in loss of
    management connectivity to the device.

    Remote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled,
    administrators can disable it using the Firewall > Basic Settings
    screen. Change the setting for the field "Remote Management" to
    "Disabled".

    Disabling remote management limits the exposure of the
    vulnerabilities to those on the local LAN.

  * Limit remote management access to specific IP addresses
    If remote management is required, harden the device so that it
    can be accessed only by certain IP addresses, rather than the
    default setting of "any". By entering the configuration screen at
    Firewall --> Basic Settings, an administrator can change the
    "Remote IP address" field to ensure only devices with the specified
    IP addresses can access the device.

The following mitigation can help limit the exposure to the
vulnerability "Retrieval of the configuration file".

  * Remove all backup configuration files from the device
    Rebooting the device after performing a configuration backup,
    will remove the configuration file from the system so that it can
    not be retrieved by an unauthenticated user.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.
