Package        : cyrus-imapd-2.2
Vulnerability  : implementation error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-1926 
Debian Bug     : 627081

It was discovered that the STARTTLS implementation of the Cyrus IMAP 
server does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows 
man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted IMAP, 
LMTP, NNTP and POP3 sessions by sending a cleartext command that is 
processed after TLS is in place.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-14+lenny4.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-19+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13p1-11 for cyrus-imapd-2.2 and in version 2.4.7-1
for cyrus-imapd-2.4.

We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.
