TeamSHATTER Security Advisory

April 21, 2011

Risk Level:
High

Affected versions:
Oracle Enterprise Manager 10g Release 1 and Release 2


Remote exploitable:
Yes

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martinez Fayo of Application Security Inc.

Details:
Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities occur when an attacker tricks a legitimate web application into sending malicious code, generally in the form of a script, to an unsuspecting end user. The attack usually involves crafting a hyperlink with malicious script code embedded within it. A valid user is likely to click this link since it points to a resource on a trusted domain. The link can be posted on a web page, or sent in an instant message, or email. Clicking on the link executes the attacker-injected code in the context of the trusted web application. Typically, the code steals session cookies, which can then be used to impersonate a valid user.
The 'locale' parameter used in web page help/topics/iastop_cs/iastop_cs_farm_page.html (part of Oracle Help component) is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. User supplied input to this parameter is returned without proper sanitization, allowing a malicious attacker to inject arbitrary scripting code.

Impact:
Attackers might steal administrator's session cookies, thereby allowing the attacker to impersonate the valid user.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this vulnerability.

Fix:
Upgrade to a supported version.  All supported Releases and Patchsets are not vulnerable.
