Package        : unbound
Vulnerability  : design flaw
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-4008

It was discovered that Unbound, a caching DNS resolver, ceases to
provide answers for zones signed using DNSSEC after it has processed a
crafted query.  (CVE-2009-4008)

In addition, this update improves the level of DNSSEC support in the
lenny version of Unbound so that it is possible for system
administrators to configure the trust anchor for the root zone.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.6-1~lenny1.

For the other distributions (squeeze, wheezy, sid), this problem has
been fixed in version 1.4.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your unbound packages.
