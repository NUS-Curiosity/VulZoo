Subject: CISS Research Team Advisory: CVE-2011-0222

I. BACKGROUND

WebKit is an open source web browser engine. It is currently used by
Apple Inc.'s Safari browser, as well as by Google's Chrome browser. For
more information, see the vendor's site at the following link.

http://webkit.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in WebKit, as
included with multiple vendors' browsers, could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML based file format used to
describe two dimensional vector graphics. It defines both a markup
language, and a JavaScript interface.

When processing DOM queries to SVG tags, Safari fails to handle
exceptional conditions.
It is possible to trigger a use after free vulnerability by query some
properties of SVG tags. This leaves a C++ object pointer
in an inconsistent state, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious webpage
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted sites.
After the user visits the malicious web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

IV. DETECTION

Safari versions prior to 5.1 and 5.0.6 are vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling JavaScript is an effective workaround for this vulnerability.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Apple Inc. has released patches which addresses this issue. For more
