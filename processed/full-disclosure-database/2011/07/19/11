It was discovered that libvirt, a library for interfacing with different
virtualization systems, is prone to an integer overflow (CVE-2011-2511).
Additionally, the stable version is prone to a denial of service,
because its error reporting is not thread-safe (CVE-2011-1486).

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.3-5+squeeze2.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.6-10+lenny2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.2-7).                                                                                                                                                          
               
                                                                                                                                                                     
We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.
