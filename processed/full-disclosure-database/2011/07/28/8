Package        : libpng

Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2501 CVE-2011-2690 CVE-2011-2691 CVE-2011-2692 
Debian Bug     : #632786 #633871

The PNG library libpng has been affected by several vulnerabilities. The
most critical one is the identified as CVE-2011-2690. Using this 
vulnerability, an  attacker is able to overwrite memory with an
arbitrary amount of data controlled by her via a crafted PNG image.

The other vulnerabilities are less critical and allow an attacker to 
cause a  crash in the program (denial of service) via a crafted PNG 
image.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny5. Due to a technical limitation in the Debian
archive processing scripts, the updated packages cannot be released
in paralell with the packages for Squeeze. They will appear shortly.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.44-1+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.46-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.
