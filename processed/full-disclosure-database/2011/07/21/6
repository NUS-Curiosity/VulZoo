-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Oracle Secure Backup. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability. 

The specific flaw exists within the validate_login function defined
within /apache/htdocts/php/common.php. The username parameter is passed
with limited sanitization to an exec_qr call which can be abused to
inject commands. The sanitation that does occur can limit the
exploitation of this issue, however code execution can likely still be
achieved. Successful attempts will yield remote code execution under the
context of the apache server.

-- Vendor Response:
Oracle has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
