CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-2703 CVE-2011-2704

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mapserver, a CGI-based
web framework to publish spatial data and interactive mapping applications.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2011-2703

  Several instances of insufficient escaping of user input, leading to
  SQL injection attacks via OGC filter encoding (in WMS, WFS, and SOS
  filters).

CVE-2011-2704

  Missing length checks in the processing of OGC filter encoding that can
  lead to stack-based buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary code.


For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.3-3+lenny7.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.5-2+squeeze2.

For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.


We recommend that you upgrade your mapserver packages.
