Subject: [Tool] DoS for OpenSLP (and others)

Hello !

SLP (Service Location Protocol) is defined by RFC 2165 and RFC 2608.
OpenSLP (the reference implementation) and others SLP softwares (like
mSLP) are vulnerable to a denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2010-3609
aka CERT VU#393783). The affected softwares include VMware ESX and ESXi,
Novell eDirectory, several SAN manufacturers, some Linux
distributions, ...

Here's a PoC triggering this vulnerability via either unicast (TCP or
UDP), broadcast and multicast : http://www.agarri.fr/docs/SLPick.py

More details (in French) on my blog : http://goo.gl/s0zHq
