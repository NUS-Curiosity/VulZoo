Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt 
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade 
solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
release train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the
earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the
anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed
in the "First Fixed Release" column of the table. The "Recommended
Release" column indicates the releases which have fixes for all the
published vulnerability at the time of this Advisory. A device
running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release
in a specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to
be vulnerable. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or
later than the release in the "Recommended Releases" column of the
table.

Workarounds
===========

There are no available workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability
other than applying infrastructure access control lists (iACLs) on
the Cisco 7600 router to block ICMP traffic destined to the IP
address of the Cisco CSG. Administrators can construct an iACL by
explicitly permitting only authorized traffic to enter the network at
ingress access points or permitting authorized traffic to transit the
network in accordance with existing security policies and
configurations. An iACL workaround cannot provide complete protection
against these vulnerabilities when the attack originates from a
trusted source address.

The iACL policy denies unauthorized ICMP packet types, including echo
request, echo-reply, host-unreachable, traceroute, packet-too-big,
time-exceeded, and unreachable, that are sent to affected devices. In
the following example, 192.168.60.0/24 is the IP address space that
is used by the affected devices, and the host at 192.168.100.1 is
considered a trusted source that requires access to the affected
devices. Care should be taken to allow required traffic for routing
and administrative access prior to denying all unauthorized traffic.
Whenever possible, infrastructure address space should be distinct
from the address space used for user and services segments. Using
this addressing methodology will assist with the construction and
deployment of iACLs.

Additional information about iACLs is in Protecting Your Core:
Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists.
