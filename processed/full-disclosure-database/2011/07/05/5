Package        : bind9
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2464

It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, does not correctly process
certain UPDATE requests, resulting in a server crash and a denial of
service.  This vulnerability affects BIND installations even if they
do not actually use dynamic DNS updates.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.6.ESV.R4+dfsg-0+lenny3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze3.

The testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid)
will be fixed later.

We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.
