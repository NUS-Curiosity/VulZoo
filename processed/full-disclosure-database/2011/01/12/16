January 12, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2010-0115

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Symantec

-- Affected Products:
Symantec Web Gateway

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Symantec Web Gateway. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the management interface which listens
by default on TCP port 443. While parsing requests sent to the login.php
page, the process does not properly sanitize the USERNAME POST
parameter. By sending a specially crafted string, a remote attacker can
leverage this vulnerability to inject arbitrary SQL into the backend
database on the server.

-- Vendor Response:
Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
