ZDI-11-015: HP Mercury Loadrunner Agent Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-015

January 12, 2011

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0272

-- CVSS:
10, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)

-- Affected Vendors:
Hewlett-Packard

-- Affected Products:
Hewlett-Packard LoadRunner

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of HP LoadRunner. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the magentproc.exe process which binds
by default on TCP ports 5001, 5002, 5003, 50500, and 54345. The process
blindly trusts a user supplied 32-bit value as an allocation size. It
then copies data directly from a request packet into the statically
allocated heap buffer. This can be abused by attackers to execute remote
code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
