Package        : dbus
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : none
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-4352

RÃ©mi Denis-Courmont discovered that dbus, a message bus application,
is not properly limiting the nesting level when examining messages with
extensive nested variants.  This allows an attacker to crash the dbus system
daemon due to a call stack overflow via crafted messages.


For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-5+lenny2.

For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.24-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.24-4.


We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.
