TeamSHATTER Security Advisory

January 20, 2011

Risk Level:
Medium

Affected versions:
Oracle Database Server version 10gR2, 11gR1 and 11gR2

Remote exploitable:
Yes

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Esteban Martínez Fayó of Application Security Inc.

Details:
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF)-also known as one-click attack, sidejacking, or session riding-is a type of malicious website exploit. Although this attack type has similarities to cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site scripting requires the attacker to inject unauthorized code into a website, while cross-site request forgery merely transmits unauthorized commands from a user the website trusts. A user that is authenticated by a cookie saved in their web browser could unknowingly send an HTTP request to a site that trusts him and thereby cause an unwanted action.

Oracle Database Vault Administrator web console lacks protection to this kind of attacks.

Impact:
It is possible for an attacker hosting a malicious web site to perform operations on a victim's behalf. The victim must have a valid session in Oracle Database Vault Administrator web console and visit the malicious web site.

Vendor Status:
Vendor was contacted and a patch was released.

Workaround:
There is no workaround for this vulnerability.  To narrow the time window when this vulnerability can be exploited you should Log off from Oracle Database Vault Administrator web console as soon as you finished using it and do not keep the session opened until it expires.

Fix:
Apply Oracle Critical Patch Update January 2011 available at Oracle Metalink.

CVE:
CVE-2010-4421
