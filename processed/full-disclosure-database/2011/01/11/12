-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. This
vulnerability was submitted to the ZDI via at the annual Pwn2Own
competition at CanSecWest. User interaction is required to exploit this
vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a
malicious file.

The flaw exists within the MSADO component. When handling the a user
specified CacheSize property the process uses this value to calculate
the 'real' cache size. This value is used without proper validation. A
remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code
under the context of the browser.
