Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leak.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2010-0435

    Gleb Napatov reported an issue in the KVM subsystem that allows virtual
    machines to cause a denial of service of the host machine by executing mov
    to/from DR instructions.

CVE-2010-3699

    Keir Fraser provided a fix for an issue in the Xen subsystem. A guest can
    cause a denial of service on the host by retaining a leaked reference to a
    device. This can result in a zombie domain, xenwatch process hangs, and xm
    command failures.

CVE-2010-4158

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the socket filters subsystem, allowing
    local unprivileged users to obtain the contents of sensitive kernel memory.

CVE-2010-4162

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an overflow issue in the block I/O subsystem that
    allows local users to map large numbers of pages, resulting in a denial of
    service due to invocation of the out of memory killer.

CVE-2010-4163

    Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the block I/O subsystem. Due to
    improper validation of iov segments, local users can trigger a kernel panic
    resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2010-4242

    Alan Cox reported an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem. Local users with
    sufficient permission to access HCI UART devices can cause a denial of
    service (NULL pointer dereference) due to a missing check for an existing
    tty write operation.

CVE-2010-4243

    Brad Spengler reported a denial-of-service issue in the kernel memory
    accounting system. By passing large argv/envp values to exec, local users
    can cause the out of memory killer to kill processes owned by other users.

CVE-2010-4248

    Oleg Nesterov reported an issue in the POSIX CPU timers subsystem. Local
    users can cause a denial of service (Oops) due to incorrect assumptions
    about thread group leader behavior.

CVE-2010-4249

    Vegard Nossum reported an issue with the UNIX socket garbage collector.
    Local users can consume all of LOWMEM and decrease system performance by
    overloading the system with inflight sockets.

CVE-2010-4258

    Nelson Elhage reported an issue in Linux oops handling. Local users may be
    able to obtain elevated privileges if they are able to trigger an oops with
    a process' fs set to KERNEL_DS.

CVE-2010-4342

    Nelson Elhage reported an issue in the econet protocol. Remote attackers can
    cause a denial of service by sending an Acorn Universal Networking packet
    over UDP.

CVE-2010-4346

    Tavis Ormandy discovered an issue in the install_special_mapping routine
    which allows local users to bypass the mmap_min_addr security restriction.
    Combined with an otherwise low severity local denial of service
    vulnerability (NULL pointer dereference), a local user could obtain elevated
    privileges.

CVE-2010-4526

    Eugene Teo reported a race condition in the Linux SCTP implementation.
    Remote users can cause a denial of service (kernel memory corruption) by
    transmitting an ICMP unreachable message to a locked socket.

CVE-2010-4527

    Dan Rosenberg reported two issues in the OSS soundcard driver. Local users
    with access to the device (members of group 'audio' on default Debian
    installations) may contain access to sensitive kernel memory or cause a
    buffer overflow, potentially leading to an escalation of privileges.

CVE-2010-4529

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the Linux kernel IrDA socket
    implementation on non-x86 architectures. Local users may be able to gain
    access to sensitive kernel memory via a specially crafted IRLMP_ENUMDEVICES
    getsockopt call.

CVE-2010-4565

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the Linux CAN protocol implementation.
    Local users can obtain the address of a kernel heap object which might help
    facilitate system exploitation.

CVE-2010-4649

    Dan Carpenter reported an issue in the uverb handling of the InfiniBand
    subsystem. A potential buffer overflow may allow local users to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption) by passing in a large cmd.ne value.

CVE-2010-4656

    Kees Cook reported an issue in the driver for I/O-Warrior USB devices.
    Local users with access to these devices maybe able to overrun kernel
    buffers, resulting in a denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2010-4668

    Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the block subsystem. A local user can
    cause a denial of service (kernel panic) by submitting certain 0-length I/O
    requests.

CVE-2011-0521

    Dan Carpenter reported an issue in the DVB driver for AV7110 cards.  Local
    users can pass a negative info->num value, corrupting kernel memory and
    causing a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-26lenny2.

The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:

                                             Debian 5.0 (lenny)
     user-mode-linux                         2.6.26-1um-2+26lenny2

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.

Note that these updates will not become active until after your system is
rebooted.
