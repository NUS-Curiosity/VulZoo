-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell GroupWise. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the gwwww1.dll module responsible for
parsing VCALENDAR data within e-mail messages. When the code encounters
a TZID variable it allocates up to 0xFFFF bytes for the variable's
value. It then proceeds to copy the value into the fixed-length buffer
without checking if it will fit. By specifying a large enough string in
the e-mail, an attacker can overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary
code under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
