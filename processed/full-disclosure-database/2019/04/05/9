Subject: [FD] Uniqkey Password Manager 1.14 - Remote Denial Of Service
 [CVE-2019-10845]


An issue was discovered in Uniqkey Password Manager 1.14.
When entering new credentials to a site that isn't registered within
this product, a pop-up window will appear asking the user if
they want to save these new credentials. The code of the pop-up window
can be read and, to some extent, manipulated by remote servers. This
pop-up window will stay on any page the user visits within the browser
until a decision is made. A malicious web server can forcefully
manipulate the pop-up and cause it not to appear, stopping users from
securing their credentials. This vulnerability is related to
id="uniqkey-password-popup" and password-popup/popup.html, but is a
different vulnerability than CVE-2019-10676.
