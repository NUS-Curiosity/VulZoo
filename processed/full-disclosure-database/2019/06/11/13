Due to unencrypted and unauthenticated data communication, the wireless
presenter Inateck WP2002 is prone to keystroke injection attacks.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that the wireless presenter Inateck WP2002 is
vulnerable to keystroke injection attacks.

An attacker can analyze the unencrypted and unauthenticated data
packets of the 2.4 GHz radio communication sent by the wireless
presenter to the receiver (USB dongle) in order to learn the used
protocol. By knowing the used data protocol, it is possible to inject
packets in the data communication that are actually interpreted as
keystrokes by the receiver on the target system.

Thus, an attacker is able to send arbitrary keystrokes to a victim's
computer system, for example in order to install malware when the target
system is unattended. In this way, an attacker can remotely take control
over the victim's computer that is operated with an affected receiver of
an Inateck WP2002 wireless presenter.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS GmbH could successfully perform keystroke injection attacks against
the wireless presenter Inateck WP2002 using the open-source software
tool Universal Radio Hacker [2] in combination with the software-defined
radio HackRF One [3].
