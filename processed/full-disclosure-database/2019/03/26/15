ESA-2017-123: EMC Networker Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

EMC Identifier: ESA-2017-123

CVE Identifier: CVE-2017-8023

Severity Rating: CVSSv3 Base Score: 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Affected products:
EMC NetWorker versions 8.2.x
EMC NetWorker versions 9.0.x
EMC NetWorker versions prior to 9.1.1.5
EMC NetWorker versions prior to 9.2.1


Summary:
EMC NetWorker includes an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability that may potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system.

Details:
EMC NetWorker may potentially be vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the Networker Client execution service (nsrexecd) when oldauth authentication method is used. An unauthenticated remote attacker could send arbitrary commands via RPC service to be executed on the host system with the privileges of the nsrexecd service, which runs with administrative privileges.

Resolution:
               The following EMC NetWorker releases address this vulnerability:
EMC NetWorker 9.1.1.5
EMC NetWorker 9.2.1
EMC NetWorker 8.2.4.11

The two options below can be used as a workaround:

1. Use nsrauth exclusively and do not allow a fallback to oldauth.
2. For customers who must use oldauth, ensure all 'servers' files are properly configured and review the "Restricting remote program executions and client-tasking rights" section in the EMC NetWorker Security Configuration Guide for how to update the servers file.

EMC recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity. Oldauth is an insecure authentication mode and supported for compatibility purposes only. Customers are strongly recommended to use nsrauth exclusively in their environment. See EMC NetWorker Security Configuration Guides listed below for additional information:
