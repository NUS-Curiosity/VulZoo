Cisco Common Service Platform Collector - Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2019-1723)
--
https://www.info-sec.ca/advisories/Cisco-Collector.html

Overview

"The Cisco Common Service Platform Collector (CSPC) is an SNMP-based
tool that discovers and collects information from the Cisco devices
installed on your network. The CSPC software provides an extensive
collection mechanism to gather various aspects of customer device
data. Information gathered by the collector is used by several Cisco
Service offers, such as Smart Net Total Care, Partner Support Service,
and Business Critical Services. The data is used to provide inventory
reports, product alerts, configuration best practices, technical
service coverage, lifecycle information, and many other detailed
reports and analytics for both the hardware and operating system (OS)
software."
