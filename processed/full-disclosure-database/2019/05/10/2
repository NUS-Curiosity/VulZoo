Description:
In the Form Maker plugin before 1.13.3 for WordPress, it's possible to
achieve SQL injection in the function get_labels_parameters in the file
form-maker/admin/models/Submissions_fm.php with a crafted value of the
asc_or_desc parameter.

PoC:
* Go in to Form-Maker menu and select Submissions.
* Open menu "Select a form" and select an any item for example "Contact Us".
* Go in to url bar and insert in asc_or_desc parameter a payload such as:

With this payload the server will sleep for 5 second.
