Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the vulnerability documented in this advisory an unauthorized
attacker can access an administrative resource that may contain plain text
credentials to a 3rd party system.

The vendor provides a patch which should be installed on affected systems.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The authorization mechanism provided by the platform is prone to an authorization
bypass vulnerability, which can be easily exploited by authenticated (but low
privileged) remote attackers for gaining access to administrative information
including plaintext passwords.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
A logged-in low privileged user (e.g. with role Analyst) is able to access
an administrative resource by calling the following URL:

https://[host]/admin/system/whois/properties

After the above URL is accessed, the server returns the following HTTP response
that contains sensitive information to a 3rd party whois service including
plaintext passwords:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: [snip]
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
