Subject: Re: [FD] local privilege escalation via CDE dtprintinfo

Hi,

Just a quick follow-up to my original advisory. The CVE name CVE-2019-2832 has been assigned to the vulnerability and Oracle has released a patch in its July 2019 CPU. Further information is available at:

https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html#AppendixSUNS 
https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocContentDisplay?id=2560938.1 

Once again, I would like to thank Jon Trulson (maintainer of the open source CDE project), Alan Coopersmith, and Ritwik Ghoshal (Oracle Security team) for their smooth and professional handling of my vulnerability report, especially given the unusual circumstances.

    Dear Full Disclosure,
    
    Please find attached an advisory for the following vulnerability:
    
    A buffer overflow in the DtPrinterAction::PrintActionExists() function in the
    Common Desktop Environment 2.3.0 and earlier, as used in Oracle Solaris 10 1/13
    (Update 11) and earlier, allows local users to gain root privileges via a long
    printer name passed to dtprintinfo by a malicious lpstat program.
    
    Note that Oracle Solaris CDE is based on the original CDE 1.x train, which is
    different from the CDE 2.x codebase that was later open sourced. Most notably,
    the vulnerable buffer in the Oracle Solaris CDE is stack-based, while in the
    open source version it is heap-based.
    
    This is a 0day vulnerability demonstrated at #INFILTRATE19 on May 2nd, 2019 in
    the talk "A bug's life: story of a Solaris 0day".
