Subject: [FD] BMC Remedy + ITAM - multiple security issues.

Hejkum kejkum,

Intro:
Multiple security related issues were identified in the BMC Remedy +
ITAM, versions 7.1.00 and 9.1.02.003 were confirmed to be vulnerable.

Issues:
1. Authenticated users can access ITAM forms using forceful browsing,
i.e. the forms are not accessible in the ITAM web user interface.
The list of available forms in the given ITAM deployment can be found
using the following URL:

https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/AR+System+Mid+Tier+Object+List/Default+Admin+View/

2. Authenticated users can obtain the list of existing ITAM usernames
in order to perform password-based attacks against these accounts.
The list of forms disclosing usernames can be found at, e.g.:

https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/User/Default+Admin+View1/
https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CMF%3AUsers/CreateUsersView/
https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CMF%3AUserViewForm/Default+Administrator+View/
https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CTM%3APeople/Default+User+View/

3. Authenticated users are able to obtain plain-text credentials of
other ITAM accounts.
It is possible to change the input type of the password field in order
to reveal its plain-text value.
The ITAM forms affected by this issue can be found at, e.g.:

https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/TLS%3APLR-Configuration+Details/Default+Admin+View/
https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CMF%3APluginConfiguration/Default+Administrator+View/

Possibly, other ITAM forms suffer from the same issue, however, it has
not been confirmed, e.g.:

https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CAI%3AAppRegistry/Default+Admin+View/
https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CMF%3ACloudServicesFulfillment/Administrator/
https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CMF%3AOpenStack_UserCredentials/Default+Administrator+View/
https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CSM%3AVCM%3AVMwareCredentialStore/Default+Administrator+View/
https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/CMA%3AConfiguration/Default+Administrator+View/
https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/AST%3AARServerConnection/Default+Admin+View/

4. Authenticated users can traverse the filesystem and browse files in
the underlying operating system running BMC Remedy + ITAM.
Access to the files users are able to view this way is restricted by
the privileges of the user which was used to start the ITAM process.
The ITAM form affected by this issue can be found at:

https://${MIDTIERSERVER}/arsys/forms/${ARSERVER}/AR+System+Administration%3A+Server+Information/Default+Admin+View/

The above issues can be chained together to escalate privileges
(horizontally and vertically) in the ITAM application.
In some circumstances it is also possible to execute commands in the
underlying operating system (e.g.
https://communities.bmc.com/thread/61257).

Contact vendor directly for remediation guidance.
