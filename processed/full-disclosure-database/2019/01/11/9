# [CVE-2018-10091] Stored XSS vulnerabilities in AudioCode IP phones

## Description

The AudioCodes 400HD series of IP phones is a range of easy-to-use,
feature-rich desktop devices for the service provider hosted services,
enterprise IP telephony and contact center markets.

Most of user inputs in the CGI interface are not protected against XSS
injections.

Theses vulnerabilities have only been tested on the 420HD phone.

## Vulnerability records

**CVE ID**: CVE-2018-10091

**Access Vector**: remote

**Security Risk**: medium

**Vulnerability**: CWE-79

**CVSS Base Score**: 5.5

**CVSS Vector String**:
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:H/RC:C


## Details

The script `mainform.cgi` is vulnerable to multiple stored XSS
vulnerabilities.

For example, it is possible to add the following string :

```html
<script>alert("XSS")</script>
```

within any field (`Name`, `Office`, `Home` or `Mobile`) on the
`Directory` page (used to add contacts). This will trigger JavaScript
code execution in the browser.

The payload gets stored and remains active in the page.

All forms on the web application, where the user input is printed on the
page, seem to be vulnerable.

Note that the vulnerable page is only available to authenticated users
(in possession of the admin configuration password).
