Description: 
============
An authenticated shell command injection issue has been discovered in  Raisecom ISCOM HT803G-U, HT803G-W, HT803G-1GE, and HT803G GPON products with thefirmware version ISCOMHT803G-U_2.0.0_140521_R4.1.47.002 or below, The values of the newpass and confpass parameters in /bin/WebMGR are used in a system call in the firmware. Because there is no user input validation, this leads to authenticated code execution on the device.

[Additional_information]

The value of newpass and confpass in /bin/WebMGR  parameter is parse to system call in the Firmware  and since their is no user input validation this leads to authenticated code execution on device
