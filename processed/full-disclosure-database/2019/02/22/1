Subject: [FD] CVE-2019-8939: XSS in Tautulli

Tautulli (https://tautulli.com/) is a Python based monitoring and tracking tool for Plex Media Server.

We discovered that an authenticated Plex Media Server user could change their Plex username to include JavaScript and Tautulli would fail to sanitize the username so that when the Plex Media Server administrator viewed certain pages generated by Tautulli, the JavaScript would be executed in the context of the server administrator.

This was disclosed to the project's issue tracker on 19 February 2019 and was marked as fixed in the next release by the developer on 20 February 2019.

Initial Report: https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli-Issues/issues/161
Patch: https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/commit/6a21d7690a40ea4678ad0908a6a1846c289cc943
