Subject: [FD] CVE-2019-3010 - Local privilege escalation on Solaris 11.x via
 xscreensaver

Dear Full Disclosure,

Please find attached an advisory for the following vulnerability, fixed in Oracle's Critical Patch Update (CPU) of October 2019:

"Exploitation of a design error vulnerability in xscreensaver, as distributed with Solaris 11.x, allows local attackers to create (or append to) arbitrary files on the system, by abusing the -log command line switch introduced in version 5.06. This flaw can be leveraged to cause a denial of service condition or to escalate privileges to root."
