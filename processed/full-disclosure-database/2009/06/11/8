Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.11.09: Multiple
 Vendor WebKit Error Handling Use After Free Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.08.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 08, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

WebKit is an open source web browser engine. It is currently used by the
Apple Inc.'s Safari browser, as well as by Google's Chrome browser. For
more information, see the vendor's site at the following link.

http://webkit.org/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in multiple
vendors' WebKit browser engine could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs when JavaScript code is used to set a certain
property of an HTML tag within a web page. When JavaScript code sets
this property, child elements of the tag are freed. However, when an
error in the remaining HTML is encountered, these previously freed tag
values are referenced. The freed memory is then treated as a C++
object, which can lead to attacker controlled values being used as
function pointers.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious web page
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted
sites. After the user visits the malicious web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

WebKit is used by multiple applications, including Google Chrome and
Apple Safari (including Safari on the iPhone). Affected versions are
listed in the Detection field of this report.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in
WebKit-r42162. Previous versions may also be affected. Additionally,
the following applications that use WebKit have been determined to be
vulnerable:

  Google Chrome 1.0.154.53
  Safari 3.2.1 (5525.27.1)
  Safari 3.1.1 running on iPhone 2.2.1 (5525.27.1)

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling JavaScript will prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
