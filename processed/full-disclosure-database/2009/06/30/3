Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark which allow
for Denial of Service (application crash) or remote code execution.

Background
==========

Wireshark is a versatile network protocol analyzer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                 /  Vulnerable  /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/wireshark       < 1.0.8                     >= 1.0.8

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Wireshark:

* David Maciejak discovered a vulnerability in packet-usb.c in the
  USB dissector via a malformed USB Request Block (URB)
  (CVE-2008-4680).

* Florent Drouin and David Maciejak reported an unspecified
  vulnerability in the Bluetooth RFCOMM dissector (CVE-2008-4681).

* A malformed Tamos CommView capture file (aka .ncf file) with an
  "unknown/unexpected packet type" triggers a failed assertion in
  wtap.c (CVE-2008-4682).

* An unchecked packet length parameter in the dissect_btacl()
  function in packet-bthci_acl.c in the Bluetooth ACL dissector causes
  an erroneous tvb_memcpy() call (CVE-2008-4683).

* A vulnerability where packet-frame does not properly handle
  exceptions thrown by post dissectors caused by a certain series of
  packets (CVE-2008-4684).

* Mike Davies reported a use-after-free vulnerability in the
  dissect_q931_cause_ie() function in packet-q931.c in the Q.931
  dissector via certain packets that trigger an exception
  (CVE-2008-4685).

* The Security Vulnerability Research Team of Bkis reported that the
  SMTP dissector could consume excessive amounts of CPU and memory
  (CVE-2008-5285).

* The vendor reported that the WLCCP dissector could go into an
  infinite loop (CVE-2008-6472).

* babi discovered a buffer overflow in wiretap/netscreen.c via a
  malformed NetScreen snoop file (CVE-2009-0599).

* A specially crafted Tektronix K12 text capture file can cause an
  application crash (CVE-2009-0600).

* A format string vulnerability via format string specifiers in the
  HOME environment variable (CVE-2009-0601).

* THCX Labs reported a format string vulnerability in the
  PROFINET/DCP (PN-DCP) dissector via a PN-DCP packet with format
  string specifiers in the station name (CVE-2009-1210).

* An unspecified vulnerability with unknown impact and attack vectors
  (CVE-2009-1266).

* Marty Adkins and Chris Maynard discovered a parsing error in the
  dissector for the Check Point High-Availability Protocol (CPHAP)
  (CVE-2009-1268).

* Magnus Homann discovered a parsing error when loading a Tektronix
  .rf5 file (CVE-2009-1269).

* The vendor reported that the PCNFSD dissector could crash
  (CVE-2009-1829).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending
specially crafted packets on a network being monitored by Wireshark or
by enticing a user to read a malformed packet trace file which can
trigger a Denial of Service (application crash or excessive CPU and
memory usage) and possibly allow for the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running Wireshark.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Wireshark users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/wireshark-1.0.8"
