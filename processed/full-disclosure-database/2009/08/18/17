Synopsis
========

An off-by-one error in Compress::Raw::Zlib and Compress::Raw::Bzip2
might lead to a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Compress::Raw::Zlib and Compress::Raw::Bzip2 are Perl low-level
interfaces to the zlib and bzip2 compression libraries.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                       /  Vulnerable  /         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  perl-core/Compress-Raw-Zlib        < 2.020               >= 2.020
  2  perl-core/Compress-Raw-Bzip2       < 2.020               >= 2.020
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Leo Bergolth reported an off-by-one error in the inflate() function in
Zlib.xs of Compress::Raw::Zlib, possibly leading to a heap-based buffer
overflow (CVE-2009-1391).

Paul Marquess discovered a similar vulnerability in the bzinflate()
function in Bzip2.xs of Compress::Raw::Bzip2 (CVE-2009-1884).

Impact
======

A remote attacker might entice a user or automated system (for instance
running SpamAssassin or AMaViS) to process specially crafted files,
possibly resulting in a Denial of Service condition.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Compress::Raw::Zlib users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
    =perl-core/Compress-Raw-Zlib-2.020

All Compress::Raw::Bzip2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
    =perl-core/Compress-Raw-Bzip2-2.020
