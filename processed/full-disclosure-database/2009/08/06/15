 Internet Explorer HTML TIME 'ondatasetcomplete' Use After Free
 Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 07.28.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 28, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

HTML+TIME (HTML Timed Interactive Multimedia Extensions)is a web
standard that was created for Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer (IE)
to allow web page authors to create timed animation content on a web
page. This is accomplished using an XML like markup that makes use of
HTML+TIME properties and elements. Internet Explorer supports this
markup standard, and also exposes a scripting interface for interacting
with the HTML+TIME elements on the page. For more information, please
see the vendor's web page at the following link:

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533099(VS.85).aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a use after free vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Internet Explorer could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs when the 'ondatasetcomplete' event method of a
timeChildren object is referenced. If this occurs when the object is in
an inconsistent state, a heap chunk will be freed, and then reused after
being freed. This results in an uninitialized VTABLE being used, which
can result in the execution of arbitrary code when the pointer is
dereferenced.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious web page
created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted
sites. After the user visits the malicious web page, no further user
interaction is needed.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Internet
Explorer versions 6, 7, and 8. Internet Explorer 5 does not appear to
be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Since this vulnerability is triggered through script code, disabling
Active Scripting will prevent the exploitation of this vulnerability.
