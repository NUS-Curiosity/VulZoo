-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft's Remote Desktop Client.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within mstscax.dll when parsing packets from an
RDP server. A design flaw in the client allows a malicious RDP server to
write to arbitrary memory inside the connecting processes memory space.
By hosting a malicious RDP server, an attacker can execute arbitrary
code on any client that attempts to connect to it. Privileges gained
depend on which user is running the client.
