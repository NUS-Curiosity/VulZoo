hey,

i think i am missing something over here....

i got lotza debian boxes here that run:

 $ uname -a
Linux srvdeb-1 2.6.26-1-686-bigmem #1 SMP Fri Mar 13 18:52:29 UTC 2009
i686 GNU/Linux


when i
 $ aptitude update ; aptitude safe-upgrade
or
 $ apt-get update ; apt-get upgrade

it tells me that im up 2 date. but in this release the bug is still
included,.,.


i had to install "linux-image-2.6.26-2-686-bigmem" via
 $ aptitude install linux-image-2.6.26-2-686-bigmem
by hand.

why is this? and how do i ensure that im not being fooled by aptitude or
apt?


regards,

moe
