Hash: SHA1

iDefense Security Advisory 07.30.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jul 30, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Flash Player is a very popular web browser plugin. It is available
for multiple web browsers and platforms, including Windows, Linux and
MacOS. Flash Player enables web browsers to display rich multimedia
content, such as online videos, and is often a requirement for popular
websites.

For more information, see the vendor's site found at the following link.

http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an invalid Loader object reference vulnerability
in Adobe Systems Inc.'s Flash Player could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user.

During the processing of a Shockwave Flash file, an object can be
created, along with multiple references that point to the object. The
object can be destroyed and its associated references removed. However
a reference can incorrectly remain pointing to the object. The invalid
object resides in uninitialized memory, which the attacker may control
to gain arbitrary execution control.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user viewing the web page. To exploit
this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Shockware
Flash file created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes
this via social engineering or injecting content into a compromised,
trusted site.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in latest
Flash Player version 9.0.124.0. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

A Internet Explorer plugin is available to temporarily block and unblock
Flash content using a single click. Only trusted sites should be
unblocked when using this plugin. More information is available at:

A Firefox plugin is available to temporarily block and unblock Flash
content using a single click. Only trusted sites should be unblocked
when using this plugin. More information is available at:
