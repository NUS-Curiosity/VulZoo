Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities in ModSecurity might lead to a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

ModSecurity is a popular web application firewall for the Apache HTTP
server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                  /  Vulnerable  /              Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apache/mod_security       < 2.5.9                    >= 2.5.9

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ModSecurity:

* Juan Galiana Lara of ISecAuditors discovered a NULL pointer
  dereference when processing multipart requests without a part header
  name (CVE-2009-1902).

* Steve Grubb of Red Hat reported that the "PDF XSS protection"
  feature does not properly handle HTTP requests to a PDF file that do
  not use the GET method (CVE-2009-1903).

Impact
======

A remote attacker might send requests containing specially crafted
multipart data or send certain requests to access a PDF file, possibly
resulting in a Denial of Service (crash) of the Apache HTTP daemon.
NOTE: The PDF XSS protection is not enabled by default.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ModSecurity users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apache/mod_security-2.5.9"
