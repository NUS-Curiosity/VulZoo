Synopsis
========

Multiple integer overflows in Python have an unspecified impact.

Background
==========

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/python     < 2.5.4-r2                        >= 2.5.4-r2
                                                             *>= 2.4.6

Description
===========

Chris Evans reported multiple integer overflows in the expandtabs
method, as implemented by (1) the string_expandtabs function in
Objects/stringobject.c and (2) the unicode_expandtabs function in
Objects/unicodeobject.c.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities in Python
applications or daemons that pass user-controlled input to vulnerable
functions. The security impact is currently unknown but may include the
execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Python 2.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.5.4-r2"

All Python 2.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/python-2.4.6"

==========
