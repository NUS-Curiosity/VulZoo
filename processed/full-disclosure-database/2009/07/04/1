Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library
might enable remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service or disclose
sensitive information.

Background
==========

The Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library (aka apr-util) provides an
interface to functionality such as XML parsing, string matching and
databases connections.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/apr-util       < 1.3.7                          >= 1.3.7

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the APR Utility
Library:

* Matthew Palmer reported a heap-based buffer underflow while
  compiling search patterns in the apr_strmatch_precompile() function
  in strmatch/apr_strmatch.c (CVE-2009-0023).

* kcope reported that the expat XML parser in xml/apr_xml.c does not
  limit the amount of XML entities expanded recursively
  (CVE-2009-1955).

* C. Michael Pilato reported an off-by-one error in the
  apr_brigade_vprintf() function in buckets/apr_brigade.c
  (CVE-2009-1956).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service (crash or memory exhaustion) via an Apache HTTP server
running mod_dav or mod_dav_svn, or using several configuration files.
Additionally, a remote attacker could disclose sensitive information or
cause a Denial of Service by sending a specially crafted input. NOTE:
Only big-endian architectures such as PPC and HPPA are affected by the
latter flaw.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library users should upgrade to the
latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/apr-util-1.3.7"
