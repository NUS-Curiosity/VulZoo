Synopsis
========

Multiple buffer overflows have been discovered in Streamripper,
allowing for user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Streamripper is a tool for extracting and recording mp3 files from a
Shoutcast stream.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  media-sound/streamripper      < 1.64.0                  >= 1.64.0

Description
===========

Stefan Cornelius from Secunia Research reported multiple buffer
overflows in the http_parse_sc_header(), http_get_pls() and
http_get_m3u() functions in lib/http.c when parsing overly long HTTP
headers, or pls and m3u playlists with overly long entries.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious server,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Streamripper users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/streamripper-1.64.0"
