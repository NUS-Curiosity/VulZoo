Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in noip-updater can lead to arbitrary code execution.

Background
==========

noip-updater is a tool used for updating IP addresses of dynamic DNS
records at no-ip.com.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  net-dns/noip-updater       < 2.1.9                       >= 2.1.9

Description
===========

xenomuta found out that the GetNextLine() function in noip2.c misses a
length check, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
code by sending a specially crafted HTTP message to the client. NOTE:
Successful exploitation requires a man in the middle attack, a DNS
spoofing attack or a compromise of no-ip.com servers.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All noip-updater users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/noip-updater-2.1.9"
