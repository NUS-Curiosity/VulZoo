1. Summary

   Updated ESX patches address an issue loading corrupt
   virtual disks and update Service Console packages
   for net-snmp and libxml2.

2. Relevant releases

   VMware ESXi 3.5 without patch ESXe350-200901401-I-SG

   VMware ESX 3.5 without patches  ESX350-200901401-SG,
                                   ESX350-200901409-SG,
                                   ESX350-200901410-SG

   VMware ESX 3.0.3 without patches ESX303-200901405-SG,
                                    ESX303-200901406-SG

   VMware ESX 3.0.2 without patches ESX-1007673, ESX-1007674

   NOTE: Extended support for ESX 3.5 Update 1 ends on 7/25/2009, users
         should plan to upgrade to at least ESX 3.5 Update 2 by that
         time.

         Extended support for ESX 3.0.2 Update 1 ends on 2009-08-08.
         Users should plan to upgrade to ESX 3.0.3 and preferably to
         the newest release available.

3. Problem Description

 a. Loading a corrupt delta disk may cause ESX to crash

    If the VMDK delta disk of a snapshot is corrupt, an ESX host might
    crash when the corrupted disk is loaded.  VMDK delta files exist
    for virtual machines with one or more snapshots. This change ensures
    that a corrupt VMDK delta file cannot be used to crash ESX hosts.

    A corrupt VMDK delta disk, or virtual machine would have to be loaded
    by an administrator.

    VMware would like to thank Craig Marshall for reporting this issue.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-4914 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch

    ESX            2.5.5     ESX      not affected

    * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 b. Updated Service Console package net-snmp

    Net-SNMP is an implementation of the Simple Network Management
    Protocol (SNMP). SNMP is used by network management systems to
    monitor hosts.

    A denial-of-service flaw was found in the way Net-SNMP processes
    SNMP GETBULK requests. A remote attacker who issued a specially-
    crafted request could cause the snmpd server to crash.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-4309 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    VMware         Product   Running  Replace with/
    Product        Version   on       Apply Patch

    ESX            3.0.2     ESX      ESX-1007673
    ESX            2.5.5     ESX      not affected

    * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 c. Updated Service Console package libxml2

    An integer overflow flaw causing a heap-based buffer overflow was
    found in the libxml2 XML parser. If an application linked against
    libxml2 processed untrusted, malformed XML content, it could cause
    the application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org) has
    assigned the name CVE-2008-4226 to this issue.

    A denial of service flaw was discovered in the libxml2 XML parser.
    If an application linked against libxml2 processed untrusted,
    malformed XML content, it could cause the application to enter
    an infinite loop.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-4225 to this issue.
