Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in MPlayer may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

MPlayer is a media player including support for a wide range of audio
and video formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package  /       Vulnerable       /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  mplayer     < 1.0_rc2_p28058-r1             >= 1.0_rc2_p28058-r1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in MPlayer:

* A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the str_read_packet()
  function in libavformat/psxstr.c when processing crafted STR files
  that interleave audio and video sectors (CVE-2008-3162).

* Felipe Andres Manzano reported multiple integer underflows in the
  demux_real_fill_buffer() function in demux_real.c when processing
  crafted Real Media files that cause the stream_read() function to
  read or write arbitrary memory (CVE-2008-3827).

* Tobias Klein reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the
  demux_open_vqf() function in libmpdemux/demux_vqf.c when processing
  malformed TwinVQ files (CVE-2008-5616).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted STR,
Real Media, or TwinVQ file to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial
of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_rc2_p28058-r1 "
