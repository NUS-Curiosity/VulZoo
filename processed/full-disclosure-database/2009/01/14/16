Description:
    In previous versions of the samba package, it may be possible for
    unauthenticated remote attackers to cause a denial of service in
    the smbd daemon, or to access the contents of some of the memory
    of the smbd daemon.  It is not known whether either of these
    vulnerabilities can be exploited in practice; this update fixes
    the bugs which may create these vulnerabilities.
