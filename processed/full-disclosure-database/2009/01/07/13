====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in SAP GUI, which 
can be exploited by malicious people to potentially compromise a 
user's system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error in the included
TabOne ActiveX control (sizerone.ocx) when copying tab captions. This
can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g. adding
multiple tabs via the "AddTab()" method.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to the latest 7.10 PL, which sets the kill-bit for the ActiveX
control.

Users can also set the kill-bit manually by following the procedure 
explained in SAP note 1092631.
