====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in ComponentOne 
SizerOne, which can be exploited by malicious people to potentially 
compromise a user's system.

The vulnerability is caused by a boundary error in the included Tab 
ActiveX control (c1sizer.ocx) when copying tab captions. This can be 
exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by e.g. adding tabs 
with overly long captions via the "AddTab()" method.

Successful exploitation may allow execution of arbitrary code.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Update to version 8.0.20081.142 of the ActiveX control.
