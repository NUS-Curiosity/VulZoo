How to determine if you are affected:

1.  Run the ApplyPTF utility (preferably the latest one from CA) 
    on the machine where SMA/SLM is installed.
2.  Select the option "List PTFs applied on local or remote 
    nodes." and click Next.
3.  Enter the hostname of the machine on which SMA/SLM is 
    installed in the "List PTF(s) on Node:" input box and make 
    sure that "List Node Type" is set to "NT".  In the input box
    "Write Output to File", you may set the complete path to a 
    text file where the output may be written, for example, 
    "C:\ptflist.txt". Click Next. 
4.  Select "UNISLM" in the Product section and click Next.
5.  The list of fixes that have been applied on SMA will be 
    provided in the output section and also written to the file 
    specified in Step 3.
6.  Manually verify if the output contains the following line: 
    a.  If the product version is SMA 11.1x, the line should be 
        "PTF Wizard installed T5LX006".
    b.  If the product version is SLM 3.5, the line should be "PTF 
        Wizard installed T5LX007".
    c.  If the product version is SMA 11.0, the line should be 
        "PTF Wizard installed T5LX008".
7.  If the line is not present, then the product is vulnerable; 
    else, it has been patched.
