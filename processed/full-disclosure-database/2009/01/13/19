Synopsis
========

Adobe Reader is vulnerable to execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Adobe Reader (formerly Adobe Acrobat Reader) is a closed-source PDF
reader.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/acroread       < 8.1.3                          >= 8.1.3

Description
===========

* An unspecified vulnerability can be triggered by a malformed PDF
  document, as demonstrated by 2008-HI2.pdf (CVE-2008-2549).

* Peter Vreugdenhil, Dyon Balding, Will Dormann, Damian Frizza, and
  Greg MacManus reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the
  util.printf JavaScript function that incorrectly handles the format
  string argument (CVE-2008-2992).

* Greg MacManus of iDefense Labs reported an array index error that
  can be leveraged for an out-of-bounds write, related to parsing of
  Type 1 fonts (CVE-2008-4812).

* Javier Vicente Vallejo and Peter Vregdenhil, via Zero Day
  Initiative, reported multiple unspecified memory corruption
  vulnerabilities (CVE-2008-4813).

* Thomas Garnier of SkyRecon Systems reported an unspecified
  vulnerability in a JavaScript method, related to an "input validation
  issue" (CVE-2008-4814).

* Josh Bressers of Red Hat reported an untrusted search path
  vulnerability (CVE-2008-4815).

* Peter Vreugdenhil reported through iDefense that the Download
  Manager can trigger a heap corruption via calls to the AcroJS
  function (CVE-2008-4817).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted PDF
document, and local attackers could entice a user to run acroread from
an untrusted working directory. Both might result in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application,
or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Adobe Reader users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/acroread-8.1.3"
