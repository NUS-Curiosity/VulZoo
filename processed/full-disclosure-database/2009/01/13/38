I. BACKGROUND

Oracle Database Server is a family of database products that range from
personal databases to enterprise solutions. Further information is

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an arbitrary file rewrite vulnerability in Oracle
Corp.'s Oracle Database 10g Release 2 database product allows attackers
to gain elevated privileges.

The vulnerability exists in a function that allows a user with an
authenticated session to create any file or rewrite any files to which
the database account has access.

III. ANALYSIS
