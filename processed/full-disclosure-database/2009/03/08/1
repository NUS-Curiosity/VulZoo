Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in the PDFjam scripts allow for local
privilege escalation.

Background
==========

PDFjam is a small collection of shell scripts to edit PDF documents,
including pdfnup, pdfjoin and pdf90.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-text/pdfjam      < 1.20-r1                         >= 1.20-r1

Description
===========

* Martin Vaeth reported multiple untrusted search path
  vulnerabilities (CVE-2008-5843).

* Marcus Meissner of the SUSE Security Team reported that temporary
  files are created with a predictable name (CVE-2008-5743).

Impact
======

A local attacker could place a specially crafted Python module in the
current working directory or the /var/tmp directory, and entice a user
to run the PDFjam scripts, leading to the execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application. A local
attacker could also leverage symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary
files.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PDFjam users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-text/pdfjam-1.20-r1"
