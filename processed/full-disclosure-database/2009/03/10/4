Synopsis
========

A buffer-overflow in Ganglia's gmetad might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Ganglia is a scalable distributed monitoring system for clusters and
grids.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-cluster/ganglia     < 3.1.1-r2                    >= 3.1.1-r2

Description
===========

Spike Spiegel reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the
process_path() function when processing overly long pathnames in
gmetad/server.c.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request to the gmetad
service leading to the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ganglia users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-cluster/ganglia-3.1.1-r2"
