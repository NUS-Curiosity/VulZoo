Synopsis
========

Insufficient input validation in BlueZ may lead to arbitrary code
execution or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

BlueZ is a set of Bluetooth tools and system daemons for Linux.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-wireless/bluez-utils       < 3.36                     >= 3.36
  2  net-wireless/bluez-libs        < 3.36                     >= 3.36
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     2 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

It has been reported that the Bluetooth packet parser does not validate
string length fields in SDP packets.

Impact
======

A physically proximate attacker using a Bluetooth device with an
already established trust relationship could send specially crafted
requests, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution or a crash.
Exploitation may also be triggered by a local attacker registering a
service record via a UNIX socket or D-Bus interface.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All bluez-utils users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/bluez-utils-3.36"

All bluez-libs users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-wireless/bluez-libs-3.36"

==========
