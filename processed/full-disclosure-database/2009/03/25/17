Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2009 March 25 1600 UTC (GMT)

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco IOS software contains two vulnerabilities within the Cisco IOS
WebVPN or Cisco IOS SSLVPN feature (SSLVPN) that can be remotely
exploited without authentication to cause a denial of service
condition. Both vulnerabilities affect both Cisco IOS WebVPN and
Cisco IOS SSLVPN features:

 1. Crafted HTTPS packet will crash device.
 2. SSLVPN sessions cause a memory leak in the device.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

There are no workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Devices running affected versions of Cisco IOS software are affected
if configured with SSLVPN.

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system
banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by
displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System
Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in
parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release
name. Other Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or
may provide different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router#show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

The following example shows a product that is running Cisco IOS
Software release 12.4(20)T with an image name of
C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M:

    Router#show version
    Cisco IOS Software, 1841 Software (C1841-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(20)T, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)
    Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport

    <output truncated>

Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming
conventions is available in "White Paper: Cisco IOS Reference Guide"
at the following link: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html

To determine that SSLVPN is enabled on your device, log in to the
device and issue the command-line interface (CLI) command "show
running-config | include webvpn". If the device returns any output
this means that SSLVPN is configured on the device and the device may
be vulnerable. Vulnerable configurations vary depending on whether
the device is supporting Cisco IOS WebVPN (introduced in Release 12.3
(14)T) or Cisco IOS SSLVPNs (introduced in Release 12.4(6)T). The
following methods describe how to confirm if the device is
vulnerable:

If the output from "show running-config | include webvpn" contains
"webvpn enable" then the device is configured with the original Cisco
IOS WebVPN. The only way to confirm the device is vulnerable is to
examine the output of "show running-config" to confirm that webvpn is
enabled via the command "webvpn enable" and that a "ssl trustpoint"
has been configured. The following example shows a vulnerable device
configured with Cisco IOS WebVPN:

    webvpn enable
    !
    webvpn
     ssl trustpoint TP-self-signed-29742012

If the output from "show running-config | include webvpn" contains
"webvpn gateway <word>" then the device is supporting the Cisco IOS
SSLVPN feature. A device is vulnerable if it has the "inservice"
command in at least one of the "webvpn gateway" sections. The
following example shows a vulnerable device configured with Cisco IOS
SSLVPN:

    Router# show running | section webvpn
    webvpn gateway Gateway
     ip address 10.1.1.1 port 443
     ssl trustpoint Gateway-TP
     inservice
     !
    Router#

A device that supports the Cisco IOS SSLVPN is not vulnerable if it
has no "webvpn gateways" configured or all the configured "webvpn
gateways" contain the "no inservice" "webvpn gateway" command.

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The following products are not affected by this vulnerability:

  * Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances
  * Cisco IOS XR Software
  * Cisco IOS XE Software

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

The Cisco SSLVPN feature provides remote access to enterprise sites
by users from anywhere on the Internet. The SSLVPN provides users
with secure access to specific enterprise applications, such as
e-mail and web browsing, without requiring them to have VPN client
software installed on their end-user devices.

The WebVPN Enhancements feature (Cisco IOS SSLVPN), released in Cisco
IOS Release 12.4(6)T, obsoletes the commands and configurations
originally put forward in Cisco IOS WebVPN.

Further information about Cisco IOS WebVPN is available in the "Cisco
IOS Software Release 12.3T WebVPN feature guide" at the following
link: 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t14/feature/guide/g_sslvpn.html

Further information about Cisco IOS SSLVPN is available in the "Cisco
IOS Software Release 12.4T SSLVPN feature guide" at the following
link: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_4t/12_4t11/htwebvpn.html

Details regarding these two vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS devices that
are running affected versions of system software are:

Crafted HTTPS packet will crash device
+--------------------------------------

A device configured for SSLVPN may reload or hang when it receives a
specially crafted HTTPS packet. Completion of the 3-way handshake to
the associated TCP port number of the SSLVPN feature is required in
order for the vulnerability to be successfully exploited, however
authentication is "not" required. The default TCP port number for
SSLVPN is 443.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsk62253 
and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier 
CVE-2009-0626 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

SSLVPN sessions cause a memory leak in the device
+------------------------------------------------

A device configured for SSLVPN may leak transmission control blocks
(TCBs) when processing an abnormally disconnected SSL session.
Continued exploitation may result in the device depleting its memory
resources and result in a crash of the device. Authentication is
"not" required to exploit this vulnerability.

The memory leak can be detected by running the command "show tcp
brief", like in the following example:

    Router#show tcp brief
    TCB       Local Address      Foreign Address     (state)
    468BBDC0  192.168.0.22.443   192.168.0.33.19794   CLOSEWAIT

    482901D8  192.168.0.22.443   192.168.0.33.16200   CLOSEWAIT

In the output above, those Transmission Control Blocks (TCBs) in the
state CLOSEWAIT will not go away and represent memory leaks. Please
note that only TCP connections with a local TCP port of 443 (the
well-known port for HTTPS) are relevant.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsw24700 
and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier 
CVE-2009-0628 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

======

Successful exploitation of any of the two vulnerabilities may result
in the device crashing, not accepting any new SSLVPN sessions or a
memory leak. Repeated exploitation may result in an extended denial
of service (DoS) condition.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult 
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to 
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
release train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the
earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the
anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed
in the "First Fixed Release" column of the table. The "Recommended
Release" column indicates the releases which have fixes for all the
published vulnerabilities at the time of this Advisory. A device
running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release
in a specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to
be vulnerable. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or
later than the release in the "Recommended Releases" column of the
table.

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for the vulnerabilities described in this
advisory.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at 
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at 
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.

Refer to http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/687/Directory/DirTAC.shtml
for additional TAC contact information, including localized telephone
numbers, and instructions and e-mail addresses for use in various
languages.
