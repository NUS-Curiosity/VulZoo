Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in OptiPNG might result in user-assisted execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

OptiPNG is a PNG optimizer that recompresses image files to a smaller
size, without losing any information.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/optipng     < 0.6.2-r1                      >= 0.6.2-r1

Description
===========

Roy Tam reported a use-after-free vulnerability in the
GIFReadNextExtension() function in lib/pngxtern/gif/gifread.c leading
to a memory corruption when reading a GIF image.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
GIF image, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OptiPNG users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/optipng-0.6.2-r1"
