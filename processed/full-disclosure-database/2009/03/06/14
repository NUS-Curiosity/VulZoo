TinX CMS is a content management system (CMS) software, usually implemented

---[ Vulnerability Description ]

Positive Technologies Research Team has discovered a SQL Injection 
vulnerability in TinX CMS.

SQL injection is an attack technique that can be used to extract, modify, 
add or delete information from database servers that are used by vulnerable 
web applications. SQL injection vulnerabilities are caused by an unsecured 
programming technique that allows client-supplied data to interfere with the 
syntax of SQL queries. SQL is a programming language that is used by 
applications to communicate with database systems.

User input passed to the "id" parameter is not properly sanitized. This can 
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the "id" 
parameter.

Example:
http://[server]/system/rss.php?id=1'SQL-code


---[ Solution ]

Update to version 3.5.1.
