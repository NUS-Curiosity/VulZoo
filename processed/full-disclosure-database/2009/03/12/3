---[ Software Description ]

SlySoft AnyDVD is capable of removing unwanted movie features, including 
subtitles and prohibition messages such as copyright and FBI warnings. It 
also allows you to launch an external application whenever you insert or 
remove a disc, or prevent 'PC-friendly' software from automatically 
launching when you insert a video DVD.

---[ Vulnerability Description ]

Positive Technologies Research Team has discovered multiple memory 
corruption vulnerabilities in SlySoft products.

The IOCTL handler in ElbyCDIO.sys 6.0.2.0 and earlier, shipped with AnyDVD, 
Virtual CloneDrive, CloneDVD and CloneCD, uses the METHOD_NEITHER 
communication method for IOCTLs and does not properly validate buffer data 
associated with the Irp object, which allows local users to crash the 
system.


---[ Solution ]
AnyDVD:
Update AnyDVD to version 6.5.2.6.
