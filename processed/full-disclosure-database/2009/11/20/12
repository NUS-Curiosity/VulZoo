           your patch deployment history.

 c. Third party library update for ntp.

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
   time with a referenced time source.

   ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0 have a ntp client that is affected by the
   following security issue. Note that the same security issue is
   present in the ESX Service Console as described in section d. of
   this advisory.

   A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
   authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
   cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
   use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
   crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
   privileges of the "ntp" user.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
   has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.

   The NTP security issue identified by CVE-2009-0159 is not relevant
   for ESXi 3.5 and ESXi 4.0.

   The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
   in this component (column 4) if a solution is available.

 d. Service Console update for ntp

   Service Console package ntp updated to version ntp-4.2.2pl-9.el5_3.2

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
   time with a referenced time source.

   The Service Console present in ESX is affected by the following
   security issues.

   A buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the ntpd daemon's NTPv4
   authentication code. If ntpd was configured to use public key
   cryptography for NTP packet authentication, a remote attacker could
   use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request packet that could
   crash ntpd or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
   privileges of the "ntp" user.

   NTP authentication is not enabled by default on the Service Console.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
   has assigned the name CVE-2009-1252 to this issue.

   A buffer overflow flaw was found in the ntpq diagnostic command. A
   malicious, remote server could send a specially-crafted reply to an
   ntpq request that could crash ntpq or, potentially, execute
   arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ntpq
   command.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
   has assigned the name CVE-2009-0159 to this issue.

   The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability

 f. Updated Service Console package python

    Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.

    When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization
    flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that
    led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values
    meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than
    expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the
    Python interpreter's privileges.

    Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python
    Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string
    object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
    a denial of service.

    Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop
    module. If a Python application used the imageop module to
    process untrusted images, it could cause the application to
    disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute
    arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.

    Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the
    Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use
    these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).

    Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python
    modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of
    service.

    An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was
    found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application
    requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression
    stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,
    execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.

    A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python
    locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly
    NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data
    stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721
    CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143

 g. Updated Service Console package bind

    Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5

    The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the
    Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server
    (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when
    interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server
    is operating correctly.

    A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message
    packets containing the "ANY" record type. A remote attacker could
    use this flaw to send a specially-crafted dynamic update packet
    that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    vMA            4.0       RHEL5    Patch 2

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 h. Updated Service Console package libxml2

    Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.

    libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A
    Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also
    which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML
    files.

    A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the
    root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker
    could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
    local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

    Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses
    the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker
    could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened by a
    local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these
    issues.

    vMA            4.0       RHEL5    Patch 2

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 i. Updated Service Console package curl

    Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5_3.5

    A cURL is affected by the previously published "null prefix attack",
    caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509
    certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted
    certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker
    could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and
    potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-2417 to this issue

  * hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion.

 j. Updated Service Console package gnutls

    Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5_3.5

    A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in
    certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get
    a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority
    trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the
    certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially
    confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-2730 to this issue
