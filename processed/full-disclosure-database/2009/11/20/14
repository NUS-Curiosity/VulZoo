http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-09-085
November 20, 2009

CVE-2009-3843

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Operations Manager.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists due to a hidden account present within the
Tomcat users XML file. Using this account a malicious user can access
the org.apache.catalina.manager.HTMLManagerServlet class. This is
defined within the catalina-manager.jar file installed with the product.
This servlet allows a remote user to upload a file via a POST request to
/manager/html/upload. If an attacker uploads malicious content it can
then be accessed and executed on the server which leads to arbitrary
code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
