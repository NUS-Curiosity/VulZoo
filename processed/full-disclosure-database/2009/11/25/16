Synopsis
========

An untrusted search path vulnerability in the dstat might result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

dstat is a versatile system resource monitor written in Python.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-apps/dstat     < 0.6.9-r1                         >= 0.6.9-r1

Description
===========

Robert Buchholz of the Gentoo Security Team reported that dstat
includes the current working directory and subdirectories in the Python
module search path (sys.path) before calling "import".

Impact
======

A local attacker could entice a user to run "dstat" from a directory
containing a specially crafted Python module, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

Do not run "dstat" from untrusted working directories.

Resolution
==========

All dstat users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/dstat-0.6.9-r1"
