 System Center Alert Management System Console Arbitrary Program Execution
 Design Error Vulnerability

Hash: SHA1

iDefense Security Advisory 04.28.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 28, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Symantec System Center is an MMC (Microsoft Management Console) snap-in
that allows an administrator to remotely manage Symantec products. The
Symantec System Center comes bundled with several Symantec products,
including Symantec Client Security and Symantec AntiVirus. It contains
an optional component called the Alert Management System Console. This
component starts a service (Intel File Transfer) that listens on TCP
port 12174.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a design error vulnerability in Symantec Corp.'s
Symantec System Center may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
with SYSTEM privileges.

The vulnerability exists within the 'Intel File Transfer' service, which
runs the xfr.exe application. When sent a properly formatted request,
this service will extract a string from the request, and use it as the
path of a program to execute as a new Process. The process will be
started with SYSTEM privileges.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. In order to exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker must be able to establish a TCP session on
port 12174 with the vulnerable host.

The vulnerable service is actually part of LANDesk Management Suite. It
is not clear whether the behavior described is part of the intended
functionality of the program. However, the manner in which the service
is being used by the Symantec System Center is unsafe.

In a default client type installation, the Symantec System Center is not
installed. The System Center would normally be found on the network
administrator's system. In addition, the Alert Management System
Console is not a default option in the installation of the System
Center.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Symantec
Client Security version 3.1. Previous versions may also be affected.

Symantec has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the
following products:

Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition Version 9.0 MR6 and earlier

Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition Version 10.0 all versions

Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition Version 10.1 MR7 and earlier

Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition Version 10.2 MR1 and earlier

Symantec Client Security Version 2.0 MR6 and earlier

Symantec Client Security Version 3.0 all versions

Symantec Client Security Version 3.1 MR7 and earlier

Symantec Endpoint Protection Version 11.0 MR2 and earlier

V. WORKAROUND

The 'Intel File Transfer' service (which launches xfr.exe) can be
disabled via the Service Manager. However, this may impair the
operation of the Alert Management Service (AMS).

Symantec recommends users of the AMS switch to 'Reporting' to manage
alerts in their environments, and disable or uninstall AMS as a
temporary mitigation.
