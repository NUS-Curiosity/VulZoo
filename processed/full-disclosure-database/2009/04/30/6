Title: CA20090429-01: CA ARCserve Backup Apache HTTP Server 
Multiple Vulnerabilities


CA Advisory Reference: CA20090429-01


CA Advisory Date: 2009-04-29


Reported By:
Apache Software Foundation
David Endler of iDefense
Ulf Harnhammar for SITIC, Swedish IT Incident Centre


Impact: A remote attacker can exploit a buffer overflow to gain 
apache privileges, or cause a denial of service.


Summary: CA ARCserve Backup on Solaris, Tru64, HP-UX, and AIX 
contains multiple vulnerabilities in the Apache HTTP Server 
version as shipped with ARCserve Backup. CA has issued updates 
that contain version 2.0.63 of the Apache HTTP Server to address 
the vulnerabilities. Refer to the References section for a list of 
resolved issues by CVE identifier.


Mitigating Factors: None


Severity: CA has given these vulnerabilities a Medium risk rating.


Affected Products:
CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 Solaris
CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 Tru64
CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 HP-UX
CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 AIX


Non-Affected Products:
CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 Windows
CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 Linux


Affected Platforms:
Solaris
Tru64
HP-UX
AIX


Status and Recommendation:
CA has issued the following patches to address the 
vulnerabilities.

CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 Solaris:
RO06786

CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 Tru64:
RO06788

CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 HP-UX:
RO06789

CA ARCserve Backup r11.5 AIX:
RO06791


How to determine if you are affected:

1. From the command line, run the following to print the version 
   of the Apache HTTP Server included with ARCserve Backup:

      $BAB_HOME/httpd/httpd -v

      Note: On HP-UX the shared library path needs to be modified 
            prior to running the httpd command:

      SHLIB_PATH=$SHLIB_PATH:$BAB_HOME/httpd/lib
      export SHLIB_PATH

2. If the displayed version is less than 2.0.63, then the 
   installation may be vulnerable.


Workaround: 
As a workaround solution, disable the Apache HTTP Server with the 
"stopgui" command. To re-enable the server, run "startgui".

Stopping the Apache HTTP Server will prevent the ARCserve user 
from performing GUI operations. Most of the operations provided by 
the GUI can be accomplished via the command line.

Alternatively, restrict remote network access to reduce exposure.
