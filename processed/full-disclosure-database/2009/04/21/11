HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability in Sun Delegated Administrator



1. *Advisory Information*

Title: HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability in Sun Delegated Administrator
Advisory ID: CORE-2009-0114
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/content/sun-delegated-administrator
Date published: 2009-04-21
Date of last update: 2009-04-21
Vendors contacted: Sun Microsystems
Release mode: Coordinated release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: HTTP response splitting
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Bugtraq ID: 34643
CVE Name: CVE-2009-1357


3. *Vulnerability Description*

An HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability [1][2] has been discovered in
Sun Java System Delegated Administrator. HTTP Response Splitting occurs
when an attacker has the possibility of injecting a carriage return
(0x0D) or a line feed (0x0A) character sequence into the HTTP headers of
the web server's response. This allows proxy cache-poisoning attacks
that affect the proxy users base when requesting a web page that belongs
to the affected domain, redirection attacks or other kind of Cross-Site
Scripting attacks.
