Synopsis
========

Multiple errors in CUPS might allow for the remote execution of
arbitrary code or DNS rebinding attacks.

Background
==========

CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System, is a full-featured print server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-print/cups      < 1.3.10                            >= 1.3.10

Description
===========

The following issues were reported in CUPS:

* iDefense reported an integer overflow in the _cupsImageReadTIFF()
  function in the "imagetops" filter, leading to a heap-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2009-0163).

* Aaron Siegel of Apple Product Security reported that the CUPS web
  interface does not verify the content of the "Host" HTTP header
  properly (CVE-2009-0164).

* Braden Thomas and Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported that
  CUPS is vulnerable to CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147 and CVE-2009-0166,
  found earlier in xpdf and poppler.

Impact
======

A remote attacker might send or entice a user to send a specially
crafted print job to CUPS, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the configured CUPS user -- by
default this is "lp", or a Denial of Service. Furthermore, the web
interface could be used to conduct DNS rebinding attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.3.10"
