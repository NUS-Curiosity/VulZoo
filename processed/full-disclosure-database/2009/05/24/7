Synopsis
========

Multiple errors in the IPSec Tools racoon daemon might allow remote
attackers to cause a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

The IPSec Tools are a port of KAME's IPsec utilities to the Linux-2.6
IPsec implementation. They include racoon, an Internet Key Exchange
daemon for automatically keying IPsec connections.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-firewall/ipsec-tools       < 0.7.2                   >= 0.7.2

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities have been found in the racoon daemon as
shipped with IPSec Tools:

* Neil Kettle reported that racoon/isakmp_frag.c is prone to a
  null-pointer dereference (CVE-2009-1574).

* Multiple memory leaks exist in (1) the eay_check_x509sign()
  function in racoon/crypto_openssl.c and (2) racoon/nattraversal.c
  (CVE-2009-1632).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted fragmented ISAKMP
packets without a payload or exploit vectors related to X.509
certificate authentication and NAT traversal, possibly resulting in a
crash of the racoon daemon.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All IPSec Tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-firewall/ipsec-tools-0.7.2"

==========
