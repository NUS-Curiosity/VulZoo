-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office's PowerPoint. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must open up a malicious file.

The vulnerability exists within the parsing of certain structures inside
a Notes container. During population of a C++ object when reading the
Notes container, Powerpoint incorrectly reads more data than was
allocated for overwriting a function pointer for the object which is
later used in a call from mso.dll. Successful exploitation can lead to
remote code execution under the credentials of the currently logged in
user.

Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
