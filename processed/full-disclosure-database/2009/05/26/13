Synopsis
========

Multiple errors in the NTP client and server programs might allow for
the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

NTP contains the client and daemon implementations for the Network Time
Protocol.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/ntp     < 4.2.4_p7                           >= 4.2.4_p7

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the programs included in
the NTP package:

* Apple Product Security reported a boundary error in the
  cookedprint() function in ntpq/ntpq.c, possibly leading to a
  stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-0159).

* Chris Ries of CMU reported a boundary error within the
  crypto_recv() function in ntpd/ntp_crypto.c, possibly leading to a
  stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-1252).

Impact
======

A remote attacker might send a specially crafted package to a machine
running ntpd, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the daemon, or a Denial of
Service. NOTE: Successful exploitation requires the "autokey" feature
to be enabled. This feature is only available if NTP was built with the
'ssl' USE flag.

Furthermore, a remote attacker could entice a user into connecting to a
malicious server using ntpq, possibly resulting in the remote execution
of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application, or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

You can protect against CVE-2009-1252 by disabling the 'ssl' USE flag
and recompiling NTP.

Resolution
==========

All NTP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/ntp-4.2.4_p7"
