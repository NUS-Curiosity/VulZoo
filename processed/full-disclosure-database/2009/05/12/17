 PowerPoint Build List Memory Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 05.12.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
May 12, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

Microsoft PowerPoint is an application used for constructing
presentations, and comes with the Microsoft Office suite. For more
information, see the vendor's site found at the following link.

http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint/default.aspx

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s PowerPoint could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the current user.

The vulnerability occurs during the parsing of the BuildList record.
This record is a container for other records that describe charts and
diagrams in the PowerPoint file. By inserting multiple BuildList
records with ChartBuild containers inside of them, it is possible to
trigger a memory corruption vulnerability during the parsing of the
ChartBuild container's contents. This allows an attacker to control an
object pointer, which can lead to attacker supplied function pointers
being dereferenced.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user opening the file. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious
file. If the targeted user is running PowerPoint 2000, and the "Office
Document Open Confirmation Tool" is not installed, then it is possible
to exploit this vulnerability directly through the browser.

Due to the nature of the vulnerability, relatively precise control of
the process memory layout is needed to successfully exploit this
vulnerability. iDefense Labs has developed exploit code that
successfully exploits this vulnerability.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the
following versions of PowerPoint:

PowerPoint 2000 SP3

PowerPoint 2002 (XP) SP3

PowerPoint 2003 SP2
