Synopsis
========

Multiple heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in libsndfile might
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing
sampled sound.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/libsndfile      < 1.0.20                     >= 1.0.20

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities have been found in libsndfile:

* Tobias Klein reported that the header_read() function in
  src/common.c uses user input for calculating a buffer size, possibly
  leading to a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-1788).

* The vendor reported a boundary error in the aiff_read_header()
  function in src/aiff.c, possibly leading to a heap-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2009-1791).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted AIFF
or VOC file in a program using libsndfile, possibly resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libsndfile users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libsndfile-1.0.20"
