3. Problem Description

 a. VMware Descheduled Time Accounting driver vulnerability may cause a
    denial of service in Windows based virtual machines.

    The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is an optional,
    experimental service that provides improved guest operating system
    accounting.

    This patch fixes a denial of service vulnerability that could be
    triggered in a virtual machine by an unprivileged, locally
    logged-on user in the virtual machine.

    Virtual machines are affected under the following conditions:

    - The virtual machine is running a Windows operating system.

    - The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting driver is installed
      in the virtual machine. Note that this is an optional (non-
      default) part of the VMware Tools installation.

    - The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is not running
      in the virtual machine

    The VMware Descheduled Time Accounting Service is no longer provided
    in newer versions of VMware Tools, starting with the versions
    released in Fusion 2.0.2 and ESX 4.0.

    However, virtual machines migrated from vulnerable releases will
    still be vulnerable if the three conditions listed above are met,
    until their tools are upgraded.

    Steps needed to remediate this vulnerability:

    Guest systems on VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Server, Fusion
     - Install the new version of Workstation, Player, ACE, Server,
       Fusion (see below for version information)
     - Upgrade tools in the virtual machine (virtual machine users
       will be prompted to upgrade).

    Guest systems on ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5, ESX 3.0.2, ESX 3.0.3
     - Install the relevant patches (see below for patch identifiers)
     - Manually upgrade tools in the virtual machine (virtual machine
       users will not be prompted to upgrade).  Note the VI Client will
       not show the VMware tools is out of date in the summary tab.
       Please see http://tinyurl.com/27mpjo page 80 for details.

    Guests systems on ESX 4.0 and ESXi 4.0 that have been migrated from
    ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5, and ESX 3.0.x
     - Install/upgrade the new tools in the virtual machine (virtual
       machine users will be prompted to upgrade).

    If the Descheduled Time Accounting driver was installed, the tools
    upgrade will result in an updated driver for Workstation, Player,
    ACE, Server, ESX 3.0.2, ESX 3.0.3, ESX 3.5, ESXi 3.5. For Fusion,
    ESX 4.0, and ESXi 4.0 the tools upgrade will result in the removal
    of the driver.

    VMware would like to thank Nikita Tarakanov for reporting this
    issue to us.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2009-1805 to this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available. See above for remediation
    details.

 b. Updated libpng package for the ESX 2.5.5 Service Console

    The libpng packages contain a library of functions for creating and
    manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.

    A flaw was discovered in libpng that could result in libpng trying
    to free() random memory if certain, unlikely error conditions
    occurred. If a carefully-crafted PNG file was loaded by an
    application linked against libpng, it could cause the application
    to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
    privileges of the user running the application.

    A flaw was discovered in the way libpng handled PNG images
    containing "unknown" chunks. If an application linked against libpng
    attempted to process a malformed, unknown chunk in a malicious PNG
    image, it could cause the application to crash.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the names CVE-2009-0040 and CVE-2008-1382 to these
    issues.

    The VMware version number of libpng after applying the update is
    libpng-1.0.14-12.i386.rpm.
