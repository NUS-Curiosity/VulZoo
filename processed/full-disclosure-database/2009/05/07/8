4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Garmin Communicator
Plug-In, which can be exploited by malicious people to bypass certain
security restrictions.

The vulnerability is caused due to a synchronisation error in the 
GARMINAXCONTROL.GarminAxControl_t.1 ActiveX control (npGarmin.dll).
This can be exploited to bypass the domain locking and dialog box 
presented to the user asking for confirmation that the untrusted site
may access private data.

Successful exploitation allows full access (such as deleting data,
retrieving personal information, or installing firmware updates) to 
any Garmin GPS products connected to the user's system.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Set the kill-bit for the affected ActiveX control.
