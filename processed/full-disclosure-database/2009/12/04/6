 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2009:313-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : bind
 Date    : December 3, 2009
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Some vulnerabilities were discovered and corrected in bind:
 
 Unspecified vulnerability in ISC BIND 9.4 before 9.4.3-P4, 9.5
 before 9.5.2-P1, 9.6 before 9.6.1-P2, 9.7 beta before 9.7.0b3,
 and 9.0.x through 9.3.x with DNSSEC validation enabled and checking
 disabled (CD), allows remote attackers to conduct DNS cache poisoning
 attacks via additional sections in a response sent for resolution
 of a recursive client query, which is not properly handled when the
 response is processed at the same time as requesting DNSSEC records
 (DO). (CVE-2009-4022).
 
 Additionally BIND has been upgraded to the latest point release or
 closest supported version by ISC.

 Update:

 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
