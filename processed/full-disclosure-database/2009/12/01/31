Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in OpenSSL might allow remote attackers to
conduct multiple attacks, including the injection of arbitrary data
into encrypted byte streams.

Background
==========

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/openssl      < 0.9.8l-r2                    >= 0.9.8l-r2

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL:

* Marsh Ray of PhoneFactor and Martin Rex of SAP independently
  reported that the TLS protocol does not properly handle session
  renegotiation requests (CVE-2009-3555).

* The MD2 hash algorithm is no longer considered to be
  cryptographically strong, as demonstrated by Dan Kaminsky.
  Certificates using this algorithm are no longer accepted
  (CVE-2009-2409).

* Daniel Mentz and Robin Seggelmann reported the following
  vulnerabilities related to DTLS: A use-after-free flaw
  (CVE-2009-1379) and a NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2009-1387) in the
  dtls1_retrieve_buffered_fragment() function in src/d1_both.c,
  multiple memory leaks in the dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message()
  function in src/d1_both.c (CVE-2009-1378), and a processing error
  related to a large amount of DTLS records with a future epoch in the
  dtls1_buffer_record() function in ssl/d1_pkt.c (CVE-2009-1377).

Impact
======

A remote unauthenticated attacker, acting as a Man in the Middle, could
inject arbitrary plain text into a TLS session, possibly leading to the
ability to send requests as if authenticated as the victim. A remote
attacker could furthermore send specially crafted DTLS packages to a
service using OpenSSL for DTLS support, possibly resulting in a Denial
of Service. Also, a remote attacker might be able to create rouge
certificates, facilitated by a MD2 collision. NOTE: The amount of
computation needed for this attack is still very large.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenSSL users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8l-r2"
