 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2009:308
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : gnutls
 Date    : December 3, 2009
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in gnutls:
 
 gnutls-cli in GnuTLS before 2.6.6 does not verify the activation
 and expiration times of X.509 certificates, which allows remote
 attackers to successfully present a certificate that is (1) not yet
 valid or (2) no longer valid, related to lack of time checks in the
 _gnutls_x509_verify_certificate function in lib/x509/verify.c in
 libgnutls_x509, as used by (a) Exim, (b) OpenLDAP, and (c) libsoup
 (CVE-2009-1417).
 
 A vulnerability have been discovered and corrected in GnuTLS
 before 2.8.2, which could allow man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
 arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
 Certification Authority (CVE-2009-2730).
 
 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
 
 This update fixes this vulnerability.
