 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2009:310
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : openssl
 Date    : December 3, 2009
 Affected: 2008.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple security vulnerabilities has been identified and fixed
 in OpenSSL:
 
 The dtls1_buffer_record function in ssl/d1_pkt.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8k
 and earlier 0.9.8 versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (memory consumption) via a large series of future epoch
 DTLS records that are buffered in a queue, aka DTLS record buffer
 limitation bug. (CVE-2009-1377)
 
 Multiple memory leaks in the dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message function
 in ssl/d1_both.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8k and earlier 0.9.8 versions allow
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption)
 via DTLS records that (1) are duplicates or (2) have sequence numbers
 much greater than current sequence numbers, aka DTLS fragment handling
 memory leak. (CVE-2009-1378)
 
 Use-after-free vulnerability in the dtls1_retrieve_buffered_fragment
 function in ssl/d1_both.c in OpenSSL 1.0.0 Beta 2 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (openssl s_client crash)
 and possibly have unspecified other impact via a DTLS packet, as
 demonstrated by a packet from a server that uses a crafted server
 certificate (CVE-2009-1379).
 
 ssl/s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8i allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash)
 via a DTLS ChangeCipherSpec packet that occurs before ClientHello
 (CVE-2009-1386).
 
 The dtls1_retrieve_buffered_fragment function in ssl/d1_both.c
 in OpenSSL before 1.0.0 Beta 2 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via
 an out-of-sequence DTLS handshake message, related to a fragment
 bug. (CVE-2009-1387)
 
 The NSS library library before 3.12.3, as used in Firefox; GnuTLS
 before 2.6.4 and 2.7.4; OpenSSL 0.9.8 through 0.9.8k; and other
 products support MD2 with X.509 certificates, which might allow
 remote attackers to spooof certificates by using MD2 design flaws
 to generate a hash collision in less than brute-force time.  NOTE:
 the scope of this issue is currently limited because the amount of
 computation required is still large (CVE-2009-2409).
 
 A regression was found with the self signed certificate signatures
 checking after applying the fix for CVE-2009-2409. An upstream patch
 has been applied to address this issue.
 
 Packages for 2008.0 are being provided due to extended support for
 Corporate products.
 
 The updated packages have been patched to prevent this.
