 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2009:281
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : cups
 Date    : October 19, 2009
 Affected: Corporate 4.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple integer overflows in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2
 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, and other products allow
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
 crafted PDF file, related to (1) JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg, (2)
 JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg, and (3) JBIG2Stream::readGenericBitmap
 (CVE-2009-0146, CVE-2009-0147).
 
 Integer overflow in the TIFF image decoding routines in CUPS 1.3.9 and
 earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
 crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image,
 which is not properly handled by the (1) _cupsImageReadTIFF function
 in the imagetops filter and (2) imagetoraster filter, leading to a
 heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2009-0163).
 
 Integer overflow in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier,
 as used in Poppler and other products, when running on Mac OS X,
 has unspecified impact, related to g*allocn (CVE-2009-0165).
 
 The JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier,
 and other products allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) via a crafted PDF file that triggers a free of uninitialized
 memory (CVE-2009-0166).
 
 Multiple integer overflows in the pdftops filter in CUPS 1.1.17,
 1.1.22, and 1.3.7 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
 PDF file that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, possibly
 related to (1) Decrypt.cxx, (2) FoFiTrueType.cxx, (3) gmem.c,
 (4) JBIG2Stream.cxx, and (5) PSOutputDev.cxx in pdftops/. NOTE:
 the JBIG2Stream.cxx vector may overlap CVE-2009-1179 (CVE-2009-0791).
 
 The ippReadIO function in cups/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 1.3.10
 does not properly initialize memory for IPP request packets, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
 dereference and daemon crash) via a scheduler request with two
 consecutive IPP_TAG_UNSUPPORTED tags (CVE-2009-0949).
 
 Two integer overflow flaws were found in the CUPS pdftops filter. An
 attacker could create a malicious PDF file that would cause pdftops
 to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code as the lp user if
 the file was printed. (CVE-2009-3608, CVE-2009-3609)
 
 This update corrects the problems.
