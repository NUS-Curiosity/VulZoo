Cisco Security Advisory: Cisco Unified Presence Denial of Service
Vulnerabilities

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20091014-cup

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2009 October 14 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Cisco Unified Presence contains two denial of service (DoS)
vulnerabilities that may cause an interruption to presence services.
These vulnerabilities were discovered internally by Cisco, and there
are no workarounds.

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20091014-cup.shtml

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following products are affected:

  * Cisco Unified Presence 1.x versions
  * Cisco Unified Presence 6.x versions prior to 6.0(6)
  * Cisco Unified Presence 7.x versions prior to 7.0(4)

Administrators of systems running Cisco Unified Presence can
determine the software version by viewing the main page of the Cisco
Unified Presence Administration interface. The software version can
be determined by running the command "show version active" via the
Command Line Interface (CLI).

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Network Flooding Vulnerability
+-----------------------------

Cisco Unified Presence contains a denial of service (DoS)
vulnerability that may cause the TimesTenD process to fail when TCP
ports 16200 or 22794 are flooded with connections. TCP 3-way
handshakes must be completed for the attack to be successful. The
TimesTenD process will be automatically restarted upon failure. This
vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsy17662 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2009-2874.

Network Connection Tracking Vulnerability
+----------------------------------------

Cisco Unified Presence contains a DoS vulnerability that involves the
tracking of network connections by the embedded firewall. An attacker
can overwhelm the table that is used to track network connections and
prevent new connections from being established to system services by
establishing many TCP connections with a vulnerable system. Any
service that listens to a TCP port on a vulnerable system could be
affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability is documented in
Cisco Bug ID CSCsw52371 and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2009-2052.

Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================

Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.

CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.

Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.

Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:

http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html

Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:

http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of any of the vulnerabilities may result in
the interruption of presence services.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
