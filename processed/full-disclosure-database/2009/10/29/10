> Oct 28, 2009
>
> I. BACKGROUND
>
> Firefox is the Mozilla Foundation's open source internet web browser.
> Among the browser's capabilities is the display of GIF images. GIF is a
> widely used image format with features such as loss-less compression,
> animation and color palettes. For more information, visit the URLs
> shown below.
>
> http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/
>
> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format
>
> II. DESCRIPTION
>
> Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow in the Mozilla Foundation's
> libpr0n image processing library allows attackers to execute arbitrary
> code.
>
> The libpr0n GIF parser was designed using a state machine which is
> represented as a series of switch/case statements. One particularly
> interesting state, 'gif_image_header', is responsible for interpreting
> a single image/frame description record. A single GIF file may contain
> many images, each with a different color map associated.
>
> The problem lies in the handling of changes to the color map of
> subsequent images in a multiple-image GIF file. Memory reallocation is
> not managed correctly and can result in an exploitable heap overflow
> condition.
>
> III. ANALYSIS
>
> Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
> code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
> To exploit this vulnerability, a targeted user must load a malicious Web
> page created by an attacker. An attacker typically accomplishes this via
> social engineering or injecting content into compromised, trusted sites.
>
> IV. DETECTION
>
> iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability using Mozilla
> Firefox versions 3.0.13 and 3.5.2 on 32-bit Windows XP SP3. Other
> versions, and potentially other applications using libpr0n, are
> suspected to be vulnerable.
>
> V. WORKAROUND
>
> Although it is not widely viewed as a viable workaround, disabling
> automatic image loading can prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.
> The following steps explains how to disable this setting on Firefox
> 3.0.x.
>
>   1. From the "Tools" menu, select "Options"
>   2. Navigate to the "Content" settings.
>   3. Ensure that "Load images automatically" is not checked.
>
> VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
>
> Mozilla has released a patch which fixes this issue in Firefox 3.5.4,
> Firefox 3.0.15, and SeaMonkey 2.0. Information about downloadable
> vendor updates can be found by clicking on the URL shown.
>
> http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ie.html
>
> VII. CVE INFORMATION
>
> The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
> name CVE-2009-3373 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
> the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
> security problems.
