I. Background
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quote: 
"CA is one of the world's largest IT management software providers.
We serve more than 99% of Fortune 1000 companies, as well as government 
entities, educational institutions and thousands of other companies 
in diverse industries worldwide" 

"CA Anti-Virus for the Enterprise is the next generation in comprehensive 
anti-virus security for business PCs, servers and PDAs. It combines 
proactive protection against malware with new, powerful management 
features that stop and remove malicious code before it enters your 
network, reducing system downtime"


II. Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Improper handling of a specially crafted RAR archive file by the CA 
Anti-Virus engine arclib component leads to heap corruption and 
allows the attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly 
further compromise the system.

Attacker has control over EBX :

Basic Block:
    6e4305b0 mov cl,byte ptr [ebx]
       Tainted Input Operands: ebx
    6e4305b2 add edi,28h
    6e4305b5 push edi
    6e4305b6 lea edx,[esp+14h]
    6e4305ba mov byte ptr [esp+14h],cl
       Tainted Input Operands: cl
    6e4305be inc ebx
       Tainted Input Operands: ebx
    6e4305bf push edx
    6e4305c0 mov ecx,esi
    6e4305c2 mov dword ptr [esp+1ch],ebx
       Tainted Input Operands: ebx
    6e4305c6 call arclib!arctkopenarchive+0x283a0 (6e42f9f0)
        
        

III. Impact
~~~~~~~~~~~
The impact ranges from Denial of Service to potential remote arbitrary code execution.
Due to the nature of Anti-virus products, the attack vectors can be near endless. An attack
could be done over the way of an E-mail message carrying an RAR attachment (of a file
recognised as being RAR), USB, CD, Network data etc.

Please note that this is a general problem and not exclusive to Computer Associates.
