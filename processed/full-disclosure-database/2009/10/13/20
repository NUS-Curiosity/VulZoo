-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader. User
interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target
must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists when the application parses a PDF file
containing a malformed Compact Font Format stream. While decoding the
font embedded in this stream, the application will explicitly trust a
16-bit value used to index into an array of elements. Usage of the
object later will cause heap corruption which can be leveraged to
achieve code execution under the context of the current user.

-- Vendor Response:
Adobe has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
