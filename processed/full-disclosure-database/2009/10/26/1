Advisory
--------

Date		2009-10-26
Program		squidGuard
URL		http://squidguard.org/
Found by	Matthieu BOUTHORS

Application description

SquidGuard is a URL redirector used to use blacklists with the proxysoftware
Squid. There are two big advantages to squidguard: it is fast and it is free.
SquidGuard is published under GNU Public License.

Vulnerability description
-------------------------

Multiple buffer overflow can lead to filtering policy bypass and DoS.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2009-3700 to this issue. This is a candidate for
inclusion in the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org), which standardizes
names for security problems.

Vulnerability details
----------------------

The vulnerability is due to insecure buffer handling.

For instance in sgLog.c :

 if(vsprintf(msg, format, ap) > (MAX_BUF - 1))

This piece of code may cause a buffer overflow and detects when it's too late.
squidGuard only logs URL with patched bypass attempts (for instance, trailing
dot or double dash, see http://www.squidguard.org/Doc/advisories.html).

MAX_BUF is 4096, squid does not allow URL greater than 4096 characters.
So in order to cause a buffer overflow, the attacker has to use an URL close to
4096 characters. A succesfull attackers would put squidGuard in emergency mode,
in this mode squidGuard approve each requests. A less succesfull attacker can
freeze the squidGuard instance, reproduct this attack can lead to a DoS.

Systems affected
----------------

squidGuard 1.3
squidGuard 1.4

Solution
--------

Two patches has been released by the squidGuard team : Patch-20091015 and
Patch-20091019.
