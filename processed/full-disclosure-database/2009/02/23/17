Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities in the web interface plugin in KTorrent allow for
remote execution of code and arbitrary torrent uploads.

Background
==========

KTorrent is a BitTorrent program for KDE.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-p2p/ktorrent       < 2.2.8                           >= 2.2.8

Description
===========

The web interface plugin does not restrict access to the torrent upload
functionality (CVE-2008-5905) and does not sanitize request parameters
properly (CVE-2008-5906) .

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted parameters to the web
interface that would allow for arbitrary torrent uploads and remote
code execution with the privileges of the KTorrent process.

Workaround
==========

Disabling the web interface plugin will prevent exploitation of both
issues. Click "Plugins" in the configuration menu and uncheck the
checkbox left of "WebInterface", then apply the changes.

Resolution
==========

All KTorrent users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-p2p/ktorrent-2.2.8"
