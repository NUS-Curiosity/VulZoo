Details.
Libero is a library management system. During an application penetration test Sense of Security identified a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search feature of the Libero web application. This occurred as a result of the application not properly filtering HTML tags which allowed malicious Javascript to be embedded. When input is incorrectly validated and not properly sanitised and then displayed in a web page, attackers can trick users into viewing the web page and causing malicious code to be executed. 
 
Proof of Concept.
You can test the susceptibility of your system to this issue by entering the following string into the search term form field and clicking 'search'.

A fix will not be made available for previous versions.
