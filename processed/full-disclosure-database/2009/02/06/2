RealNetworks RealPlayer IVR File Processing Multiple Code Execute Vulnerabilities
2009.February.05 

Fortinet's FortiGuard Global Security Research Team Discovers Two Vulnerabilities in RealNetworks RealPlayer.

Summary:
========

Two code execute vulnerabilities exist in RealNetworks RealPlayer 11 through malformed IVR files. 

Impact:
=======

Remote Code Execution.

Risk:
=====

Critical

Affected Software:
==================

RealNetworks RealPlayer 11

Additional Information:
=======================

Internet Video Recording (IVR) files contain media content that is played and recorded by RealPlayer. A remote attacker could craft a malicious IVR file, that when sent to an unsuspecting user, may allow the execution of arbitrary code when viewed, using one of two vulnerabilities during RealPlayer's IVR processing routine:

    * A heap corruption vulnerability that occurs when altering a field that determines the length of a structure
    * A vulnerability that allows an attacker to write one null byte to an arbitrary memory address by using an overly long file name length value

It should be noted that the victim does not necessarily have to open the malicious file for exploitation to occur: the vulnerabilities lie in a DLL that is also used as a plugin for the Windows Explorer shell. A successful attack could take place by merely previewing the IVR file through Windows Explorer.

Solutions:
==========

The FortiGuard Global Security Research Team released the signature "RealNetworks.RealPlayer.IVR.File.Processing.Code.Execution"

Fortinet customers who subscribe to Fortinet’s intrusion prevention (IPS) service should be protected against these code execute vulnerabilities. Fortinet’s IPS service is one component of FortiGuard Subscription Services, which also offer comprehensive solutions such as antivirus, Web content filtering and antispam capabilities.
