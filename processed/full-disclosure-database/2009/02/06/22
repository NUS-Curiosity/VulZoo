 Node Manager ovlaunch CGI BSS Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.06.09
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 06, 2009

I. BACKGROUND

HP Network Node Manager (NNM) is an application suite that is used to
map out and manage network topography. NNM runs on a variety of
platforms, including Linux and multiple versions of Windows. For more
information, see the vendor's site found at the following link.

http://www.openview.hp.com/products/nnm/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a BSS based buffer overflow vulnerability in
Hewlett-Packard Development Co. LP (HP)'s Network Node Manager could
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
affected service.

The vulnerability exists within the 'ovlaunch' CGI application, which is
used to launch the remote user interface. By sending a specially crafted
request, it is possible to trigger a buffer overflow. The vulnerability
results from an unchecked function call. The buffer that is overflowed
makes it possible to overwrite various pointers that are located after
the buffer in memory.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the affected service. IIS runs CGI
applications with reduced privileges, so a full system compromise is
not possible using only this vulnerability.

In iDefense Labs testing, it was possible to overwrite various pointers
stored after the overflowed buffer. Given this, code execution is
likely to be possible.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Network
Node Manager version 7.53 for Windows. Previous versions may also be
affected.

The Linux version of 'ovlaunch' contains the vulnerable code, but it is
not triggered. The actual hostname is used instead of the attacker
supplied 'Host' parameter.

V. WORKAROUND

Requiring authentication by modifying the session.conf file is not a
valid workaround for this vulnerability. The vulnerability occurs
during the parsing of requests, before any authentication checks.

However, it is possible to use the IIS configuration manager to require
authentication in order to execute the ovlaunch CGI. Additionally, the
IIS configuration manager can be used to limit connections by IP
address.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Hewlett-Packard Development Co. LP (HP) has released a patch which
addresses this issue. For more information, consult their advisory at
