Synopsis
========

A directory traversal was found in ZNC, allowing for overwriting of
arbitrary files.

Background
==========

ZNC is an advanced IRC bouncer.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package      /  Vulnerable  /                          Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-irc/znc       < 0.074                                >= 0.074

Description
===========

The vendor reported a directory traversal vulnerability when processing
DCC SEND requests.

Impact
======

A remote, authenticated user could send a specially crafted DCC SEND
request to overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user
running ZNC, and possibly cause the execution of arbitrary code e.g. by
uploading a malicious ZNC module.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All ZNC users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =net-irc/znc-0.074
