Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Horde and two modules,
allowing for the execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure,
or Cross-Site Scripting.

Background
==========

Horde is a web application framework written in PHP. Horde IMP, the
"Internet Messaging Program", is a Webmail module and Horde Passwd is a
password changing module for Horde.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/horde              < 3.3.4                      >= 3.3.4
  2  www-apps/horde-imp          < 4.3.4                      >= 4.3.4
  3  www-apps/horde-passwd       < 3.1.1                      >= 3.1.1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     3 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Horde:

* Gunnar Wrobel reported an input sanitation and directory traversal
  flaw in framework/Image/Image.php, related to the "Horde_Image driver
  name" (CVE-2009-0932).

* Gunnar Wrobel reported that data sent to
  horde/services/portal/cloud_search.php is not properly sanitized
  before used in the output (CVE-2009-0931).

* It was reported that data sent to
  framework/Text_Filter/Filter/xss.php is not properly sanitized before
  used in the output (CVE-2008-5917).

Horde Passwd: David Wharton reported that data sent via the "backend"
parameter to passwd/main.php is not properly sanitized before used in
the output (CVE-2009-2360).

Horde IMP: Gunnar Wrobel reported that data sent to smime.php, pgp.php,
and message.php is not properly sanitized before used in the output
(CVE-2009-0930).

Impact
======

A remote authenticated attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to
execute arbitrary PHP files on the server, or disclose the content of
arbitrary files, both only if the file is readable to the web server. A
remote authenticated attacker could conduct Cross-Site Scripting
attacks. NOTE: Some Cross-Site Scripting vectors are limited to the
usage of Microsoft Internet Explorer.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Horde users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =www-apps/horde-3.3.4

All Horde IMP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =www-apps/horde-imp-4.3.4

All Horde Passwd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =www-apps/horde-passwd-3.1.1
