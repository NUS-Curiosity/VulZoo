Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

Any Cisco device configured with ACLs using the object group feature
and running an affected Cisco IOS software version is affected by
this vulnerability.

Note: The Object Groups for ACLs feature was introduced in Cisco IOS
software version 12.4(20)T.

To verify whether object groups are configured in a Cisco IOS device,
use the "show object-group" command in user EXEC or privileged EXEC
mode. The following example displays a sample output from the "show
object-group" command when object groups are configured:

    Router# show object-group
    Network object group my_host_group
     host 172.18.104.123
    
    Service object group my_allowed_services
     tcp eq www
     tcp eq 443

Alternatively, administrators can also use the "show running config |
include ^ (permit|deny) .*object-group" command to verify whether
object groups are configured, as shown in the following example:

    Router#show running-config | include ^ (permit|deny) .*object-group
     permit object-group my_allowed_services host 10.10.1.1 host 10.20.1.1
     permit tcp any object-group my_host_group eq 22

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router#show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco devices that are not configured with object groups are not
vulnerable.

Cisco IOS XE Software and Cisco IOS XR Software are not affected by
this vulnerability.

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

In Cisco IOS Software an object group can contain a single object
(such as a single IP address, network, or subnet) or multiple objects
(such as a combination of multiple IP addresses, networks, or
subnets). In an ACL that is based on an object group, administrators
can create a single access control entry (ACE) that uses an object
group name instead of creating many ACEs, which each would require a
different IP address. A similar object group, such as a protocol port
group, can be extended to limit access to a set of applications for a
user group to a server group.

A vulnerability exists in Cisco IOS Software that could allow an
unauthenticated attacker to bypass access control policies when the
Object Groups for ACLs feature is used.

Note: The Object Groups for ACLs feature was introduced in Cisco IOS
software version 12.4(20)T.

This vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco Bug IDs:

  * CSCsx07114
  * CSCsu70214
  * CSCsw47076
  * CSCsv48603

and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete
upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
release train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the
earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the
anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed
in the "First Fixed Release" column of the table. The "Recommended
Release" column indicates the releases which have fixes for all the
published vulnerabilities at the time of this Advisory. A device
running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release
in a specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to
be vulnerable. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or
later than the release in the "Recommended Releases" column of the
table.

customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
