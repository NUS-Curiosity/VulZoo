Affected Products
=================

The vulnerability described in this document applies to the Cisco
Unified Communications Manager.

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions are
affected:

  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager 5.x versions prior to 5.1(3g)
  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager 6.x versions prior to 6.1(4)
  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.0.x versions prior to 7.0(2a)su1
  * Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1.x versions prior to 7.1(2)

Cisco Unified CallManager versions 4.x are not affected by this
vulnerability. Administrators of systems that are running Cisco
Unified Communications Manager versions 5.x, 6.x and 7.x can
determine the software version by viewing the main page of the Cisco
Unified Communications Manager Administration interface. The software
version can also be determined by running the "show version active"
command via the command-line interface.

A SIP trunk must be configured for the Cisco Unified CallManager
server to begin listening for SIP messages on TCP and UDP port 5060
and TCP/5061. However, in Cisco Unified Communications Manager
versions 5.x and later, the use of SIP as a call signaling protocol
is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

Cisco IOS Software is also affected by this vulnerability, but it is
associated with different Cisco bug IDs. A companion security
advisory for Cisco IOS Software is available at:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20090923-sip.shtml

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

Cisco Unified CallManager versions 4.x are not affected by this
vulnerability. With the exception of Cisco IOS software, no other
Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this
vulnerability.

Details
=======

Cisco Unified Communications Manager is the call processing component
of the Cisco IP Telephony solution that extends enterprise telephony
features and functions to packet telephony network devices, such as
IP phones, media processing devices, voice-over-IP gateways, and
multimedia applications.

SIP is a popular signaling protocol that manages voice and video
calls across IP networks such as the Internet. SIP is responsible for
handling all aspects of call setup and termination. Voice and video
are the most popular types of sessions that SIP handles, but the
protocol is flexible enough to accommodate other applications that
require call setup and termination. SIP call signaling can use UDP
(port 5060), TCP (port 5060), or Transport Layer Security (TLS; TCP
port 5061) as the underlying transport protocol.

A DoS vulnerability exists in the SIP implementation of the Cisco
Unified Communications Manager. This vulnerability could be triggered
when Cisco Unified Communications Manager processes crafted SIP
messages. An exploit could lead to a reload of the main Cisco Unified
Communications Manager process.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCsz95423 and has been
assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2009-2864.

and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete
upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

The following table contains the first fixed software release for
this vulnerability. A device running a version of the given release
in a specific row (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be
vulnerable.

+---------------------------------------+

Workarounds
===========

There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.

It is possible to mitigate this vulnerability by implementing
filtering on screening devices and permitting TCP/UDP access to ports
5060 and TCP/5061 only from networks that require SIP access to Cisco
Unified Communications Manager servers.

If Cisco Unified Communications Manager does not need to provide SIP
services, administrators can configure the Cisco Unified
Communications Manager to listen for SIP messages on non standard
ports. Use the following instructions to change the ports from their
default values:

Step 1 Log into the Cisco Unified CallManager Administration web
interface.

Step 2 Navigate to System > Cisco Unified CM and locate the
appropriate Cisco Unified Communications Manager.

Step 3 Change the fields SIP Phone Port and SIP Phone Secure Port
fields to a non standard port and click Save.

SIP Phone Port, which is 5060 by default, refers to the TCP and UDP
ports where the Cisco Unified Communications Manager listens for
normal SIP messages, and SIP Phone Secure Port, by default 5061,
refers to the TCP port where the Cisco Unified Communications Manager
listens for SIP over TLS messages. For additional information about
this procedure, refer to the "Updating a Cisco Unified Communications
Manager" section of the "Cisco Unified Communications Manager
Administration Guide" at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucmbe/admin/7_0_1/ccmcfg/b02ccm.html#wp1057513

Note: For a SIP port change to take effect, the Cisco CallManager
Service must be restarted. For information on how to restart the
service, refer to the "Restarting the Cisco CallManager Service"
section of the document at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucmbe/admin/7_0_1/ccmcfg/b03dpi.html#wp1075124

Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in the
network are available in the companion document "Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the
Denial of Service Vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications
Manager and Cisco IOS Software", which is available at the following
