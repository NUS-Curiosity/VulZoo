Synopsis
========

An insecure temporary file usage has been reported in Screenie,
allowing for symlink attacks.

Background

Screenie is a small screen frontend that is designed to be a session
handler.

Affected packages

Description
===========

Dmitry E. Oboukhov reported that Screenie does not handle
"/tmp/.screenie.#####" temporary files securely.

Impact

A local attacker could perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary
files with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

All Screenie users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =app-misc/screenie-1.30.0-r1
