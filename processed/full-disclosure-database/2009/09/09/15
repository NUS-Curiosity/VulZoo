Synopsis
========

An insecure temporary file usage has been reported in the C* music
player, allowing for symlink attacks.

Background
==========

The C* Music Player (cmus) is a modular and very configurable
ncurses-based audio player.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/cmus     < 2.2.0-r1                       >= 2.2.0-r1

Description
===========

Dmitry E. Oboukhov reported that cmus-status-display does not handle
the "/tmp/cmus-status" temporary file securely.

Impact
======

A local attacker could perform symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary
files with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All C* music player users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose =media-sound/cmus-2.2.0-r1
