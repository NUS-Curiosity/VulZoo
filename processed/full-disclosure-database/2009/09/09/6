Cisco Security Advisory: TCP State Manipulation Denial of Service
Vulnerabilities in Multiple Cisco Products

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20090908-tcp24

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2009 September 8 1700 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Multiple Cisco products are affected by denial of service (DoS)
vulnerabilities that manipulate the state of Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) connections. By manipulating the state of a TCP
connection, an attacker could force the TCP connection to remain in a
long-lived state, possibly indefinitely. If enough TCP connections
are forced into a long-lived or indefinite state, resources on a
system under attack may be consumed, preventing new TCP connections
from being accepted. In some cases, a system reboot may be necessary
to recover normal system operation. To exploit these vulnerabilities,
an attacker must be able to complete a TCP three-way handshake with a
vulnerable system.

In addition to these vulnerabilities, Cisco Nexus 5000 devices
contain a TCP DoS vulnerability that may result in a system crash.
This additional vulnerability was found as a result of testing the
TCP state manipulation vulnerabilities.

Cisco has released free software updates for download from the Cisco
website that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate
these vulnerabilities are available.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

The following Cisco products have a TCP implementation that is
affected by these vulnerabilities. Refer to the Software Versions and
Fixes section for information on fixed software.

Cisco IOS Software

To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a
Cisco product, administrators can log into the device and issue the 
"show version" command to display the system banner. The system banner
confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying
text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or
"Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses,
followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other
Cisco devices do not have the "show version" command or may provide
different output.

The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running
Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(26) with an installed image name of
C2500-IS-L:

    Router#show version
    Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software
    IOS (tm) 2500 Software (C2500-IS-L), Version 12.3(26), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable
+--------------------------------

The following Cisco products are not affected:

  * Cisco IOS XR
  * Cisco IOS Software Modularity
  * Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX Software version 8.2
  * Cisco PIX Software version 6.x and earlier
  * Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM)
  * Cisco Multilayer Distribution Switches (MDS)
  * Cisco Application Control Engine (ACE) Modules and Appliances
  * Cisco ACE XML Gateway
  * Cisco Access Control Server (ACS) Solution Engine
  * Cisco Guard
  * Cisco Security Monitoring, Analysis, and Response System (CS-MARS)
  * Cisco ONS 15000
  * Cisco Content Services Switches (CSS)
  * Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS)
  * Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)
  * IronPort C, M, S and X Series Appliances

Cisco PSIRT tested Cisco products that are based on Linux and
Microsoft Windows operating systems and found that although TCP
connections in a FINWAIT1 state may temporarily consume system
resources the operating systems eventually clear the TCP connections.
If enough system resources are consumed, a sustained DoS condition
may be possible. This outcome is highly dependent on the
configuration and usage of a system. For more information about how
these vulnerabilities affect Microsoft Windows operating systems,
please consult the following Microsoft website at the following link:

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=155978

No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these
vulnerabilities.

Details
=======

Multiple Cisco products are affected by DoS vulnerabilities in the
TCP protocol. By manipulating the state of TCP connections, an
attacker could force a system that is under attack to maintain TCP
connections for long periods of time, or indefinitely in some cases.
With a sufficient number of open TCP connections, the attacker may be
able to cause a system to consume internal buffer and memory
resources, resulting in new TCP connections being denied access to a
targeted port or an entire system. A system reboot may be required to
restore full system functionality. A full TCP three-way handshake is
required to exploit these vulnerabilities.

Network devices are not directly impacted by TCP state manipulation
DoS attacks transiting a device; however, network devices that
maintain the state of TCP connections may be impacted. If the
attacker can establish enough TCP connections through a transit
device that maintains TCP state, device resources may be exhausted
and prevent the device from processing new TCP connections, resulting
in a DoS condition. If an affected device that forwards traffic (that
is, routes) in a network is the target of a TCP state manipulation
attack, the attacker could cause a network-impacting DoS condition.

Cisco IOS Software

All Cisco IOS Software versions are affected by this vulnerability. A
device running Cisco IOS Software that is under attack will have
numerous hung TCP connections in the FINWAIT1 state. The "show tcp
brief" command can be used to display the hung TCP connections. The
following is example output showing an attack in progress.

    Router#show tcp brief | include FIN
    63D697C4  192.168.1.10.80            192.168.1.20.38479         FINWAIT1

The vulnerabilities for Cisco IOS Software are documented in Cisco
Bug ID CSCsv04836.

Cisco IOS-XE Software

All Cisco IOS-XE Software versions are affected by this
vulnerability. A device running Cisco IOS-XE Software that is under
attack will have numerous hung TCP connections in the FINWAIT1 state.
The "show tcp brief" command can be used to display the hung TCP
connections. The following is example output showing an attack in
progress.

    Router#show tcp brief | include FIN
    63D697C4  192.168.1.10.80            192.168.1.20.38479         FINWAIT1
    63032A28  192.168.1.10.80            192.168.1.20.54154         FINWAIT1
    645F8068  192.168.1.10.80            192.168.1.20.56287         FINWAIT1
    630323F4  192.168.1.10.80            192.168.1.20.6372          FINWAIT1
    63D69190  192.168.1.10.80            192.168.1.20.23489         FINWAIT1

The vulnerabilities for Cisco IOS-XE Software are documented in Cisco
Bug ID CSCsv07712.

Cisco CatOS Software

All Cisco CatOS Software versions are affected by these
vulnerabilities. A device running Cisco CatOS Software that is under
attack will have numerous hung TCP connections in the FIN_WAIT_1
state. The "show netstat" command can be used to display the hung TCP
connections. The following is example output showing an attack in
progress.

    Console> (enable) show netstat
    Active Internet connections (including servers)
    Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)

The vulnerabilities for Cisco CatOS Software are documented in Cisco
Bug ID CSCsv66169.

Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX Software

All Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX Software versions are affected by these
vulnerabilities. A device running Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX Software
that is under attack will have numerous TCP connections in the
established state. The "show asp table socket" command can be used to
display the TCP connections. The following is example output showing
a potential attack in progress.

    FIREWALL# show asp table socket | grep ESTAB
    TCP       123a8a6c  192.168.1.10:80           192.168.1.20:46181    ESTAB
    TCP       123e6d54  192.168.1.10:80           192.168.1.20:29546    ESTAB
    TCP       1244f78c  192.168.1.10:80           192.168.1.20:40271    ESTAB
    TCP       124f8d2c  192.168.1.10:80           192.168.1.20:46599    ESTAB
    TCP       12507f2c  192.168.1.10:80           192.168.1.20:5607     ESTAB

It is possible for normal traffic to cause established TCP
connections to appear on Cisco ASA or PIX devices, especially VPN
connections terminated to the device. In order to confirm if
established TCP connections are part of an attack, administrators
should use a monitoring point outside the firewall such as a packet
sniffer or Netflow collection agent to examine the profile of the
suspicious TCP connections and determine if an attack is occurring.

Note: The show asp table socket command was introduced in Cisco ASA
and Cisco PIX Software 8.0(1).

Further detail about hung TCP connections can be found with "show conn
detail all long" command. The IP address used to qualify the example
below is the address of the firewall interface under attack.

    FIREWALL# show conn detail all long | grep 192.168.1.10
    TCP outside:192.168.1.20/62345 (192.168.1.20/62345) NP Identity Ifc:192.168.1.10/80 (192.168.1.10/80), flags UB, idle 0s, uptime 0s, timeout 1m0s, bytes 0

    TCP outside:192.168.1.20/57147 (192.168.1.20/57147) NP Identity Ifc:192.168.1.10/80 (192.168.1.10/80), flags UB, idle 0s, uptime 0s, timeout 1m0s, bytes 0

Note: Both troubleshooting commands referenced about will display TCP
connections that are terminated to a firewall interface and
transiting through the firewall.

The vulnerabilities for Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX Software are
documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsv02768.

Cisco NX-OS Software

All Cisco Nexus 5000 and 7000 platforms running Cisco NX-OS Software
are affected by these vulnerabilities. A Nexus 5005 or 7000 device
running Cisco NX-OS Software that is under attack will have numerous
hung TCP connections in the FIN_WAIT_1 state. The "show tcp connection
detail" command can be used to display the hung TCP connections. The
following is example output showing an attack in progress.

    NEXUS# show tcp connection detail | include FIN
    
      State: FIN_WAIT_1
      State: FIN_WAIT_1
      State: FIN_WAIT_1
      State: FIN_WAIT_1
      State: FIN_WAIT_1

The hung TCP connection vulnerabilities for Nexus 5000 and Nexus 7000
devices are documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsv08325 and Cisco Bug ID CSCsv08579
respectively.

While investigating the TCP state manipulation vulnerabilities, it
was discovered that Cisco NX-OS on Nexus 5000 platforms may be
vulnerable to a system crash when receiving a specific sequence of
TCP packets. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID 
CSCsv08059 and has been assigned CVE identifier CVE-2009-0627.

The TCP state manipulation vulnerabilities have been assigned Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2008-4609.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the TCP state manipulation vulnerabilities
may result in a DoS condition where new TCP connections are not
accepted on an affected system. Repeated exploitation may result in a
sustained DoS condition. A reboot may be required to recover affected
systems.

In addition, Cisco Nexus 5000 systems may crash upon receiving a
specific sequence of TCP packets.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult:

http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt

and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a
complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Cisco IOS Software

Each row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) names a Cisco IOS
release train. If a given release train is vulnerable, then the
earliest possible releases that contain the fix (along with the
anticipated date of availability for each, if applicable) are listed
in the "First Fixed Release" column of the table. The "Recommended
Release" column indicates the releases which have fixes for all the
published vulnerabilities at the time of this Advisory. A device
running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release
in a specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to
be vulnerable. Cisco recommends upgrading to a release equal to or
later than the release in the "Recommended Releases" column of the
table.

Workarounds
===========

It is possible to mitigate these vulnerabilities with the following
workarounds.

Cisco IOS Software

The Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices provides examples of many
useful techniques to mitigate against the TCP state manipulation
vulnerabilities. These include:

  * Infrastructure Access Control Lists (iACL)
  * Receive Access Control Lists (rACL)
  * Transit Access Control Lists (tACL)
  * VTY Access Control Lists
  * Control Plane Policing (CoPP)
  * Control Plane Protection (CPPr)
  * Management Plane Policing (MPP)

For more information on the topics listed above, consult the Cisco
Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_tech_note09186a0080120f48.shtml

Cisco CatOS Software

Cisco CatOS software provides VLAN Access Control Lists (VACL) to
mitigate against the TCP state manipulation vulnerabilities. For more
information on configuring VACLs on CatOS 7.x software versions,
please consult the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/catos/7.x/configuration/guide/acc_list.html

For more information on configuring VACLs on CatOS 8.x software
versions, please consult the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/catos/8.x/configuration/guide/acc_list.html

Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX Software

Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX Software provide a method to expire stalled
half-closed TCP connections that helps mitigate against the TCP state
manipulation vulnerabilities. This method protects against attacks
directed to a firewall and devices protected by a firewall. The 
"timeout half-closed" command will expire TCP sessions that have
remained in a half-closed state beyond a user-configured timeout.

    FIREWALL(config)# timeout half-closed 0:5:0

This command will set the TCP half-closed timeout to the smallest
permitted value of five minutes. For more information on the TCP
half-closed timeout, please consult the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/asa/asa80/command/reference/t.html#wp1500148

Cisco Nexus Software

Cisco Nexus software provides several ACL methods to mitigate against
the TCP state manipulation vulnerabilities. For more information on
configuring ACLs on Nexus 5000 systems, please consult the following
link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/configuration/guide/cli_rel_4_0_1a/sec_ipacls.html

For more information on configuring ACLs on Nexus 7000 systems,
please consult the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/4_1/nx-os/security/configuration/guide/sec_nx-os-cfg.html

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at:

http://www.cisco.com

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
