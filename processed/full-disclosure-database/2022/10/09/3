Public Disclosure:         2022-10-07
CVE Reference:             CVE-2022-28383
Author of Advisory:        Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The Verbatim Store 'n' Go Secure Portable SSD is a portable USB drive
with AES 256-bit hardware encryption and a built-in keypad for passcode
entry.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"The AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption seamlessly encrypts all data on the
drive in real-time with a built-in keypad for password input. The hard
drive does not store passwords in the computer or systemâ€™s volatile
memory making it far more secure than software encryption. Also, if it
falls into the wrong hands, the hard drive will lock and require
re-formatting after 20 failed password attempts."[1]

Due to insufficient firmware validation, an attacker can store
malicious firmware code for the USB-to-SATA bridge controller on the
external drive, which gets executed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

When analyzing the external data storage Verbatim Store 'n' Go Secure
Portable SSD, Matthias Deeg found out that the validation of the
firmware for the USB-to-SATA bridge controller INIC-3637EN only consists
of a simple CRC-16 check (XMODEM CRC-16).

Thus, an attacker is able to store malicious firmware code for the
INIC-3637EN with a correct checksum on the used SPI flash memory chip
(XT25F01D), which then gets successfully executed by the USB-to-SATA
bridge controller.

For instance, this security vulnerability could be exploited in a
so-called "supply chain attack" when the device is still on its way to
its legitimate user.

An attacker with temporary physical access during the supply could
program a modified firmware on the Verbatim Keypad Secure, which always
uses an attacker-controlled AES key for the data encryption, for
example.

If, later on, the attacker gains access to the used USB drive, he
can simply decrypt all contained user data.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS was able to read and write the SPI flash memory containing the
firmware of the INIC-3637EN controller (128 KB) using a universal
programmer.

By analyzing the dumped memory content, SySS found out that the
INIC-3637EN firmware is stored from the file offset 0x4000 to the file
offset 0x1BFFB, and that the corresponding XMODEM CRC-16 is stored at
the file offset 0x1FFFC.

Matthias Deeg developed a simple Python tool for updating the checksum
of modified firmware images before writing them to the SPI flash memory
chip.

The following output exemplarily shows updating a modified firmware
image:

$ python update-firmaware.py firmware_hacked.bin
Verbatim Store 'n' Go Firmware Updater v0.1 - Matthias Deeg, SySS GmbH 
(c) 2022
[*] Computed CRC-16 (0x0874) does not match stored CRC-16 (0x5E8C).
[*] Successfully updated firmware file
