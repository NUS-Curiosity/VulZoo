         CVE Name       CVE-2022-26498                                        

      Description     When using STIR/SHAKEN, it���s possible to download       
                      files that are not certificates. These files could be   
                      much larger than what you would expect to download.     
    Modules Affected  res_stir_shaken                                         

    Resolution  If you are using STIR/SHAKEN in Asterisk, upgrade to one of   
                the versions listed below. Asterisk now checks the            
                downloaded file to see if it���s actually a certificate or if   
                it is larger than what is expected.                           
                                                                              
                If not upgrading, the curl_timeout option in                  
                stir_shaken.conf should be utilized so that downloads do not  
                last an extended period of time.
