          CVE Name        CVE-2022-26651                                      

      Description     Some databases can use backslashes to escape certain    
                      characters, such as backticks. If input is provided to  
                      func_odbc which includes backslashes it is possible     
                      for func_odbc to construct a broken SQL query and the   
                      SQL query to fail.                                      
                                                                              
                      Additionally while it has not yet been reproduced this  
                      security advisory is also being published to cover the  
                      case of SQL injection with the aim of database          
                      manipulation by an outside party.                       
    Modules Affected  func_odbc                                               

    Resolution  A new dialplan function, SQL_ESC_BACKSLASHES, has been added  
                to the func_odbc module which will escape backslashes. If     
                your usage of func_odbc may have input which includes         
                backslashes and your database uses backslashes to escape      
                backticks then use the dialplan function to escape the        
                backslashes.                                                  
                                                                              
                A second option is to disable support for backslashes for     
                escaping in your database if the underlying database          
                supports it.
