Vendor description:
-------------------
"Femanager is an extension for a TYPO3 Frontend-User Registration.
Maybe you know sr_feuser_register but you want to use a more modern extension,
give femanager a try.
This extension basicly brings an easy-to-use frontend-user-registration with a
profile manager to your system. In addition femanager was developed to be
very flexible and to bring a lot of features out of the box."

Source: https://docs.typo3.org/p/in2code/femanager/master/en-us/Introduction/Index.html


Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patched version which should be installed immediately.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2021-36787)
The default configuration of the upload function within the registration workflow
of the femanager to create new frontend users allows an upload of various file types
as profile image.

An attacker can use the upload function in the registration process to upload
SVG files with embedded JavaScript code that is stored on the webserver.
Depending on the developed application, the malicious JavaScript code is
executed in the context of other users in various scenarios, e.g. when a user
visits the profile of the attacker's frontend user.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2021-36787)
The vulnerability can be triggered if the extension's image upload function is
used.

The following proof of concept shows the crafted HTTP Request that was used to
create a user with embedded JavaScript code in the SVG file. This SVG file is
used as profile image, which leads to execution every time the image is rendered.

HTTP Request:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /login/registrieren?tx_femanager_pi1%5Baction%5D=create&tx_femanager_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=New&cHash=XXX HTTP/1.1

The vendor confirmed that the following versions are also affected by the vulnerability:
* femanager: 6.0.0 - 6.3.0 and 5.5.0 and below


Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2021-07-05: Contacting vendor through security@...o3.org.
2021-07-06: Received information from vendor that they will work on a solution.
2021-08-10: Received info from vendor about a released Typo3 Security Advisory that covers
             the vulnerability. The advisory also covers the updated versions of the
             extensions that should be used.
2022-01-17: Release of security advisory.


Solution:
---------
The vendor provides a patched version which should be installed immediately.

Further information can be found at the Typo3 security advisory:
https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-ext-sa-2021-010


Workaround:
-----------
The upload of SVG files could be disabled. This can be accomplished by adjusting the
configuration file of the femanager extension. If SVG files are necessary for the functions
of the website, it must be ensured that malicious code within these files, e.g. in the form
of JavaScript, is not executed.
