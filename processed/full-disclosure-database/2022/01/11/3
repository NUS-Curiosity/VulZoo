Subject: [FD] CVE-2021-39623 Libstagefright (Media Framework on Android)
 with OOB write on the heap

Hi list,

Maybe you will find it interesting.

Forcedentry state of the art exploit (as I read) used by NSO made it
big. Libstagefright (Media Framework on Android) with OOB write on the
heap (with Scudo) which can possibly own your Mobile by playing an
audio file, didn't. Note: Not sure if you can do RCE with it. Leave it
to experts :P

Here is the repo with reporoducer and possibly also code in the future
to create it when needed.

Thanks,
Marcin
