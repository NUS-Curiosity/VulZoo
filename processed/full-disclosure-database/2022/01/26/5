## Affected Components Description

The SAP Cryptographic Library manages digital signatures in SAP systems as
well
as provides several features related to encryption. For example, it acts as
the
security provider for SNC, TLS, SPNego or SSF.
This library is present in most SAP systems and its components, like SAP
Netweaver,
SAP HANA DB, Webdispatcher, Content Server, SAP Host Agent and more.


## Vulnerability Details

A memory corruption vulnerability exists for ```secssf_SsfVerifyEx()``` in
