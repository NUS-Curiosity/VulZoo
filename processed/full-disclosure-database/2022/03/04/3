         CVE Name       CVE-2022-21723                                        

      Description     If an incoming SIP message contains a malformed         
                      multi-part body an out of bounds read access may        
                      occur, which can result in undefined behavior. Note,    
                      it���s currently uncertain if there is any externally     
                      exploitable vector within Asterisk for this issue, but  
                      providing this as a security issue out of caution.
