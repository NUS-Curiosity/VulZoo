Subject: [FD] CVE-2022-24108: OpenCart's plugin "So Listing Tabs" <= 2.2.0
 Deserialization of Untrusted Data

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 2.2.0 is affected, and prior versions are likely affected too.

[-] Vulnerabilities Description:

Vulnerable component is switching to another tab. To exploit
vulnerability, an attacker may send a POST request (with
application/x-www-form-urlencoded content-type) to AJAX endpoint
(usually "/index.php") with "is_ajax_listing_tabs" parameter set to
"1" and "setting" parameter containing a PHP-serialized object,
which would be deserialized at server-side. Gadget-chains based on PHP
server-side code can be used to gain remote code execution, file
write, DOS, etc.

So Listing Tabs is an Opencart plugin, so the Opencart PHP classes are
available in webapp lifecycle. In source code of Opencart there is a PHP
gadget-chain which allows to write a file to the server.
Using this gadget, an attacker can write .php files with PHP code inside
app's web root and then execute it via requesting them, thus gaining
remote code
execution, which makes insecure deserialization in So Listing Tabs
especially dangerous. Ability to write files can also be used to DOS the
system by writing large files and exhausting disk space, it can be used to
perform XSS attacks by creating HTML files inside web root.

Here is an example of request which will write PHP file on server
in /tmp directory:

---
POST /index.php HTTP/2
Host: 0.0.0.0
Content-Length: 3870
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Referer: http://0.0.0.0/
