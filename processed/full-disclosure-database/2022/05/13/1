Subject: [FD] some details regarding CVE-2022-24422 / iDRAC VNC
	authentication

The Dell advisory is a bit low on details, so:

The vulnerability is really just CVE-2006-2369 / CVE-2006-2450, but
wrapped in TLS (we're in the 2020s, our auth bypasses are secure now!)

That means that your vuln scanner might or might not detect it, Nessus
for example does, but Nexpose apparently doesn't.

It also means that metasploit's "realvnc_41_bypass" is not directly
usable, you need to use your favorite TLS wrapper with it.

I have no POC code, I actually stumbled upon it with Nessus and
exploited it with metasploit and some socat mixed in. That's all that
there is to it...

Have fun,

cm.
