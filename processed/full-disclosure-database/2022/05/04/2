# Onapsis Security Advisory 2022-0002: Denial of Service in SAP NetWeaver
JAVA

## Impact on Business

This vulnerability can be used by an attacker to make a Denial of Service
to SAP Netweaver Java, making HTTP server unavailable during attack
execution.

## Advisory Information

- Public Release Date: 04/05/2021
- Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2022-0002
- Researcher(s): Gaston Traberg

## Vulnerability Information

- Vendor: SAP
- Affected Components:
  - Java NetWeaver Core 7.10-7.50

  (Check SAP Note 3056652 for detailed information on affected releases)

- Vulnerability Class: CWE-400 - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
- CVSS v3 score: 7.5 (V:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
- Risk Level: High
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2021-33670
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 3056652

## Affected Components Description

One of the principal entry points in all SAP Application Server Java is the
HTTP
Web Server. As part of this service there are many standard components
analyzing
and preprocessing the data sent to and received from the users. Because
these
components are in a critical place, vulnerabilities on them are really
serious
and affect all NetWeaver JAVA based SAP Products.

## Vulnerability Details

SAP Netweaver Java has a stack of standard J2EE filters responsable to do
some
controls and statistical operations over each received request. The
vulnerability
exists because one of those filters is keeping information about the
different HTTP
methods received by the server, but it is not properly controlling how much
memory
it needs to store that information. After sending a specially crafted
request, an
attacker is able to make that filter raise an OutOfMemoryError, making the
virtual
machine crash.

## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 3056652 which provides patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3056652.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
