Subject: [FD] [SYSS-2022-017]: Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard
 Drive - Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345)
 (CVE-2022-28385)

Advisory ID:               SYSS-2022-017
Product:                   Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive
Manufacturer:              Verbatim
Affected Version(s):       #53650
Tested Version(s):         #53650
Vulnerability Type:        Insufficient Verification of Data 
Authenticity (CWE-345)
Risk Level:                Low
Solution Status:           Open
Manufacturer Notification: 2022-02-03
Solution Date:             -
Public Disclosure:         2022-06-08
CVE Reference:             CVE-2022-28385
Author of Advisory:        Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

The Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive is a USB drive with
AES 256-bit hardware encryption and a built-in fingerprint sensor for
unlocking the device with previously registered fingerprints.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows:

"The AES 256-bit Hardware Encryption seamlessly encrypts all data on the
drive in real-time. The drive is compliant with GDPR requirements as
100% of the drive is securely encrypted. The built-in fingerprint
recognition system allows access for up to eight authorised users and
one administrator who can access the device via a password. The hard
drive does not store passwords in the computer or system's volatile
memory making it far more secure than software encryption."[1]

Due to missing integrity checks, an attacker can manipulate the content
of the emulated CD-ROM drive containing the Windows and macOS client
software.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

When analyzing the Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive,
Matthias Deeg found out that the content of the emulated CD-ROM drive
containing the Windows and macOS client software can be manipulated.

The content of this emulated CD-ROM drive is stored as ISO-9660 image
in the "hidden" sectors of the USB drive that can only be accessed
using special IOCTL commands, or when installing the drive in an
external disk enclosure.

The following output exemplarily shows the content of the ISO-9660
file system:

By manipulating this ISO-9660 image or replacing it with another one, an
attacker is able to store malicious software on the emulated CD-ROM
drive which then may get executed by an unsuspecting victim when using
the device.

For example, an attacker with temporary physical access during the
supply could program a modified ISO-9660 image on the Verbatim
Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive, which always uses an attacker-
controlled password for unlocking the device.

If, later on, the attacker gains access to the used USB drive, he can
simply decrypt all contained user data.

Storing other arbitrary, malicious software is also possible.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS could successfully modify the content of the ISO-9660 image
containing the Windows and macOS software for unlocking and managing the
Verbatim Fingerprint Secure Portalbe Hard Drive.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

SySS GmbH is not aware of a solution for the described security issue.
