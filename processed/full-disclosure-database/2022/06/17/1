Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review of these
products conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve all
security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Outdated Vulnerable Software Components
A static scan with the IoT Inspector (ONEKEY) revealed outdated software packages that
are used in the devices' firmware. Four of them were verified by using the
MEDUSA scalable firmware runtime.


2) Hardcoded Backdoor User (CVE-2022-32985)
A hardcoded root user was found in "/etc/passwd". In combination with the
invoked dropbear SSH daemon in the libnx_apl.so library, it can be used on port
50201 and 50200 to login on a system shell.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Outdated Vulnerable Software Components
Based on an automated scan with the IoT Inspector (ONEKEY) the following third party
software packages were found to be outdated:

Firmware version 6.02L:
BusyBox       1.20.2
Dropbear SSH  2012.55
GNU glibc     2.17
lighttpd      1.4.48
OpenSSL       1.0.2h

The following CVEs were verified with MEDUSA scalable firmware emulation:

* CVE-2015-9261 (Unzip)
The crafted ZIP archive "x_6170921383890712452.bin" was taken from:
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/10/25/3
Execution inside the firmware emulation:

bash-4.2# unzip x_6170921383890712452.bin
Archive:  x_6170921383890712452.bin

ra  = 0044b968 in busybox[400000+99000]
Segmentation fault


* CVE-2015-0235 (gethostbyname "GHOST" buffer overflow)

PoC code was taken from:
https://gist.github.com/dweinstein/66e6a088191ac0e8105c


* CVE-2015-7547 (getaddrinfo buffer overflow)

PoC code was taken from:
https://github.com/fjserna/CVE-2015-7547

-bash-4.4# python /medusa_exploits/cve-2015-7547-poc.py &

Segmentation fault


* CVE-2017-16544 (shell autocompletion vulnerability)

A file with the name "\ectest\n\e]55;test.txt\a" was created to trigger the
vulnerability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ls "pressing <TAB>"
test
]55;test.txt
#
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) Hardcoded Backdoor User (CVE-2022-32985)
The hardcoded system user, reachable via the dropbear SSH daemon was found due
to multiple indications on the system. The undocumented root user itself was
contained in the "passwd" file:

Content of the file "/etc/passwd".
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
root:oFQzvQf5qrI56:0:0:root:/home/root:/bin/sh
[...]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A suspicious port for the SSH daemon was chosen in the config file of dropbear:

Content of the file "/etc/init.d/dropbear":
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
DAEMON=/usr/sbin/dropbear
NAME=dropbear
DESC="Dropbear SSH server"
PIDFILE=/var/run/dropbear.pid

DROPBEAR_PORT="50200 -p 50201"
[...]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is invoked from "/usr/lib/libnx_apl.so.0.0.0", which can be seen in the
following pseudo-code:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void dropbear_server_init(char param_1)

{
   __pid_t __pid;
   char *pcVar1;
   int aiStack16 [2];

   __pid = fork();
   if (__pid == 0) {
     __pid = fork();
     if (__pid != 0) {
                     /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
       exit(0);
     }
     if (param_1 == '\0') {
       pcVar1 = "/etc/init.d/dropbear stop";
     }
     else {
       pcVar1 = "/etc/init.d/dropbear start";                               <---
     }
     execl("/bin/sh","sh",&DAT_2cd91564,pcVar1,0);
   }
   else {
     waitpid(__pid,aiStack16,0);
   }
   return;
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This function is called if a specific command is issued in the CLI interface:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
   iVar6 = telnet_cmp_command((char *)(param_3 + 0xf2),"ssh",2);
   if (iVar6 != 0) {
     if (param_2 < 4) {
       netbuf_fwd_sprintf(param_1,"\r\n%%Error: Parameter missing\r\n");
       iVar6 = shared_mem_get_addr(&var_shm);
       iVar7 = shared_mem_get_addr(&var_shm);
       uVar8 = shared_mem_read_u8(&var_shm,iVar7 + 0x161a);
       shared_mem_write_u8(&var_shm,iVar6 + 0x161a,uVar8 & 0xff | 0x10);
       return;
     }
     iVar6 = telnet_cmp_command((char *)(param_3 + 0x16b),"start",1);
     if (iVar6 != 0) {
       dropbear_server_init('\x01');                                        <---
       netbuf_fwd_sprintf(param_1,"Starting dropbear...\r\n");
       return;
     }
     iVar6 = telnet_cmp_command((char *)(param_3 + 0x16b),"stop",1);
     if (iVar6 != 0) {
       dropbear_server_init('\0');                                          <---
       netbuf_fwd_sprintf(param_1,"Stopping dropbear...\r\n");
       return;
     }
     netbuf_fwd_sprintf(param_1,"Uknown dropbear command...\r\n");
     return;
[...]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mentioned library is used in the CLI program that is running on the device.
