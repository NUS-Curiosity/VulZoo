Subject: [FD] CVE-2023-46307

While conducting a penetration test for a client, they were running an
application called etc-browser which is a public GitHub project with a
Docker container. While fuzzing the web server spun up with etcd-browser
(which can run on any arbitrary port), the application had a Directory
Traversal vulnerability that is simply triggered with the following payload:

GET /../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd


If running in the docker container, the /etc/passwd file is from the Docker
Container instance itself.

The vulnerability exists in the server.js file used to spin up the web
server.

The Docker Container and the current application code in GitHub as of
11/11/2023 is vulnerable with no fix from the developers. The security
issue was submitted back on August 9th 2023. Video of exploitation will be
available in the next few days after this public release posting.
