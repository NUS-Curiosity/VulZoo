[Vulnerability Description]

 CVE-2023-46383 : Insecure Permissions
 Loytec LINX Configurator could be connected to Loytec devices with
 an administrator credential, and it could configure device settings. 
 Since it uses HTTP Basic Authentication, which transmits usernames 
 and passwords in base64-encoded cleartext, so anyone could easily
 steal credentials if they sniff network traffics. Once obtaining the
 admin password, attackers could connect and control Loytec devices 
 via LINX configurator.
 
 CVE-2023-46384 :  Insecure Permissions 
 Following registry key contains hard-coded clear text admin password 
 for recently connected Loytec device. (password cache) If an attacker 
 succeeds in getting this registry key value, attackers could connect 
 and control Loytec devices via LINX configurator.

  Key: Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\LOYTEC\LOYTEC LINX Configurator\OhioIni
  Value name: ftp_pass
  Value dada: <admin password>

 CVE-2023-46385 : Insecure Permissions
 When Loytec LINX Configurator connects to a device, it sends HTTP GET 
 request to login. Since cleartext password is passed as an URL parameter, 
 "password" without sufficient protection, anyone could easily steal 
 credentials if they sniff network traffics. Once obtaining the admin 
 password, attackers could connect and control Loytec devices via LINX 
 configurator.
