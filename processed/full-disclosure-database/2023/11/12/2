> > Vulnerability Details:
> > 

> > The management interface of the SENEC.Inverter is publicly accessible via the
> > Internet. This circumstance is recommended by the manufacturer and customers are
> > advised to open the necessary ports to enable remote maintenance.
> > As a result, anyone who manages to detect and successfully exploit security
> > vulnerabilities in SENEC.Inverter, for instance the authors of this report, can
> > access and compromise all devices available on the internet without
> > restrictions. To achieve this,it is possible to use an IoT search engine such as
> > Shodan to automatically obtain an up-to-date list of IP addresses of all devices
> > in just a few seconds.
> > 

> > Besides Shodan, there are other IoT search engines such as Censys or ZoomEye to
> > complement the list even further.
> > Consequently, it is very easy for an attacker to develop an exploit script for
> > the automated compromise of all SENEC.Inverter devices, e.g. to simul-
> > taneously shut down all appliances or to damage them through a targeted
> > overload. For this purpose, only the hard-coded credentials previously
> > identified in findings CVE-2023-39168 and CVE-2023-39169 need to be used in
> > conjunction with SENEC.Inverter’s built-in API.
> > 

> > ********************************************************************************
> > 

> > Proof of Concept (PoC):
> > 

> > The attack consists of the following steps:
> > 

> > 1. use the shodan dork to obtain management-interfaces.
> > (no longer valid, patched by manufacturer)
