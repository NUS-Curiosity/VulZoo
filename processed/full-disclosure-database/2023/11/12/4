> > Vulnerability Details:
> > 

> > The management interface of the SENEC.Inverter transmits security-critical data
> > (authentication credentials) in cleartext in a communication channel that can be
> > sniffed by unauthorized actors. For example, in networking, packets can traverse
> > many intermediary nodes from the source to the destination, whether across the
> > internet or an internal network. Some actors might have privileged access to a
> > network interface or any link along the channel, such as a router. As a result,
> > network traffic could be sniffed by adversaries, spilling security-critical data.
> > Incidentally, this refers not only to remote maintenance of the photovoltaic
> > system, but also to on-site configuration by a technician at the customer’s
> > premises. Due to the lack of transport encryption, a technically skilled
> > customer is therefore also able to gather authentication credentials by
> > intercepting network traffic, e.g. at the central network gateway.
