Subject: [FD] Defense in depth -- the Microsoft way (part 86): shipping
	rotten software to billions of unsuspecting customers

Hi @ll,

the 7 cURL versions after 8.0.1, released March 20, 2023,
<https://curl.se/docs/releases.html>, fix the following 3
vulnerabilities <https://curl.se/docs/vulnerabilities.html>:
CVE-2023-38039 <https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38039.html>
CVE-2023-38545 <https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html>
CVE-2023-38546 <https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38546.html>


Once again (really: for several months), in their VERY finite wisdom
(really: almost INFINITE sloppy- and lazyness), Microsoft but dares to
ship rotten and vulnerable software (i.e. cURL.exe 8.0.1) to billions
of unsuspecting customers, i.e. they fail MISERABLY in following their
own mantra "Keep your (build) systems patched".
