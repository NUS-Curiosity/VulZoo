Subject: [FD] Squid Caching Proxy Security Audit: 55 Vulnerabilities,
	35 0days.

Dear fulldisclosure,

Two and a half years ago an independent audit was performed on The Squid
Caching Proxy, which ultimately resulted in 55 vulnerabilities being
discovered in the project's C++ source code.

Although some of the issues have been fixed, the majority (35) remain
valid. The majority have not been assigned CVEs, and no patches or
workarounds are available. Some of the listed issues concern more than one
bug, which is why 45 issues are listed, despite there being 55
vulnerabilities in total (10 extra of the result of similar, but different
pathways to reproduce a vulnerability).

After two and a half years of waiting, I have decided to release the issues
publicly. The Squid Project is aware of this release.

The issues are listed below. Due to the sheer size of issues discovered,
technical details are not included in this email. However, breakdowns of
the code and proof-of-concepts can be found on GitHub:
