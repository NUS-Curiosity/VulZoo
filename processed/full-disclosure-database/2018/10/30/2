EE 4GEE HH70 Home Router Hardcoded Root SSH Credentials Advisory

Hardware Version/Model: 4GEE Router HH70VB-2BE8GB3 (HH70VB)
Vulnerable Software Version: HH70_E1_02.00_19
Patched Software Version: HH70_E1_02.00_21
Vulnerability CVE(s): CVE-2018-10532
Product URL: 
https://shop.ee.co.uk/dongles/pay-monthly-mobile-broadband/4gee-router/details

Vulnerability Description:
An issue was discovered on EE 4GEE HH70VB-2BE8GB3 HH70_E1_02.00_19 devices.

Hardcoded root SSH credentials were discovered to be stored within the
"core_app" binary utilised by the EE router for networking services. An 
attacker with knowledge of the default password (oelinux123) could login 
to the router via SSH as the root user, which could allow for the loss 
of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. This 
would also allow for the bypass of the "AP Isolation" mode that is 
supported by the router, as well as the settings for multiple Wireless 
networks, which a user may use for guest clients.

Attack Vectors:
An attacker must be able to communicate with the SSH server, however the 
router supports multiple networks and "AP Isolation" mode which could be 
bypassed if the malicious user compromises the router with
the default credentials/hard coded SSH credentials.

Attack Type: Remote:
Impact: Administrative SSH Access
Affected Component:
root@...nWrt:/usr/bin# strings core_app | grep root
sshpass -p oelinux123 scp root@....168.225.1:%s %s
sshpass -p oelinux123 scp %s root@....168.225.1:%s
