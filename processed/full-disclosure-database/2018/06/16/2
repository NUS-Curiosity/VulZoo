CA20180614-01: Security Notice for CA Privileged Access Manager

Issued: June 14th, 2018
Last Updated: June 14th, 2018

CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to multiple potential 
risks with CA Privileged Access Manager. Multiple vulnerabilities 
exist that can allow a remote attacker to conduct a variety of attacks.  
These risks include seven vulnerabilities privately reported within 
the past year to CA Technologies by security researchers, and nine 
vulnerabilities for Xceedium Xsuite that were publicly disclosed in 
July 2015.  CA Technologies acquired Xceedium in August 2015, and 
Xceedium products were renamed and became part of Privileged Access 
Management solutions from CA Technologies.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-9021, has a high risk rating and 
concerns the ajax_cmd.php file, which can allow a remote attacker to 
execute arbitrary commands.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-9022, has a high risk rating and 
concerns configuration file poisoning, which can allow a remote 
attacker to execute arbitrary code.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2018-9023, has a medium risk rating and 
concerns the update_crld script, which can allow an unprivileged user 
to gain root privileges.

The fourth vulnerability, CVE-2018-9024, has a low risk rating and 
concerns IP spoofing in logs, which can allow a remote attacker to 
masquerade as another machine.

The fifth vulnerability, CVE-2018-9025, has a low risk rating and 
concerns insufficient input validation on the login page, which can 
allow a remote attacker to poison a log file.

The sixth vulnerability, CVE-2018-9026, has a medium risk rating and 
concerns insecure handling of user sessions in multiple scripts, which 
can allow a remote attacker to conduct session fixation attacks.

The seventh vulnerability, CVE-2018-9027, has a medium risk rating and 
concerns insufficient input validation in multiple scripts, which can 
allow a remote attacker to conduct reflected XSS attacks.

The eighth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4664, has a high risk rating and 
concerns insufficient input validation in the login.php script, which 
can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.

The ninth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4665, has a medium risk rating and 
concerns insufficient input validation in the ajax_cmd.php script, 
which can allow a remote attacker to conduct reflected XSS attacks.

The tenth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4666, has a high risk rating and 
concerns insufficient input validation in the read_sessionlog.php 
script, which can allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to conduct 
directory traversal attacks and download sensitive information.

The eleventh vulnerability, also CVE-2015-4664, has a high risk rating 
and concerns insufficient input validation by the spadmind script, 
which can allow a local attacker to execute privileged commands.

The twelfth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4667, has a low risk rating and 
concerns the use of hard-coded credentials in multiple scripts, which 
can allow an attacker to potentially conduct a variety of attacks.

The thirteenth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4669, has a high risk rating 
and concerns insecure database credentials, which can allow a local 
user to conduct a variety of attacks.

The fourteenth vulnerability, CVE-2015-4668, has a low risk rating and 
concerns the openwin.php script, which can allow a remote attacker to 
conduct open redirect attacks.

The fifteenth vulnerability, CVE-2018-9028, has a low risk rating and 
concerns unsalted passwords, which can allow an attacker to more 
easily crack passwords.

The sixteenth vulnerability, CVE-2018-9029, has a medium risk rating 
and concerns insufficient input validation in multiple scripts, which 
can allow an attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks.
