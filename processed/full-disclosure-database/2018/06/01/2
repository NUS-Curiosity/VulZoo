Subject: [FD] DisplayLink Installer 8.2.1956 DLL Hijack to privilege
	escalation CVE-2018-7884

Hi all,

During installation or update of DisplayLink Core Software 8.2.1956 if it
is executed as SYSTEM, as is the case on many companies,binary cl_1956.exe
(Cleaner Application) is extracted to "%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp" and later
executed as SYSTEM using the command line: "C:\Windows\TEMP\cl_1956.exe"
-min -maxVersion 8.2.1956.0.

This path "%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp" is user writable, at least in win10, and
cl_1956.exe is vulnerable to DLL hijack. It loads several dll which are not
known_dll and you can at least hijack wtsapi32.dll to execute code in the
process context.

An unprivileged local user can copy a self compiled dll with name
wtsapi32.dll to %SYSTEMROOT%\Temp, and gain SYSTEM privileges when
cl_1956.exe loads and executes it.
