Summary:  
Dell EMC NetWorker Server has been updated to remediate a Clear-Text authentication over network vulnerability that could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system. 

Details:  

Dell EMC NetWorker versions between 9.0 and 9.1.1.8 through 9.2.1.3, and the version 18.1.0.1 contain a Clear-Text authentication over network vulnerability in the Rabbit MQ Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) component.
