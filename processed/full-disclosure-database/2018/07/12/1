Details:
Authorization ByPass Vulnerability (CVE-2018-1245)
RSA Identity Lifecycle and Governance versions 7.0.1, 7.0.2 and 7.1.0 contains an authorization bypass vulnerability within the workflow architect component (ACM).

Once bypassed, a malicious user could potentially run arbitrary system commands at the OS level with application owner privileges on the affected system.  CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.0  AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
 
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability (CVE-2018-1255)RSA Identity Lifecycle and Governance versions 7.0.1, 7.0.2 and 7.1.0 contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim application user to supply malicious HTML or JavaScript code to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser.
CVSS v3 Base Score: 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
