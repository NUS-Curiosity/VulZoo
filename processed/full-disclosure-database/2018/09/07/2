Subject: [FD] CVE-2018-15898: Subsonic Music Streamer 4.4 (Android) -
 Improper Certificate Validation

Description:
The Subsonic Music Streamer application 4.4 for Android has Improper
Certificate Validation of the Subsonic server certificate, which might
allow man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain interaction data.

Affected Product: Subsonic Music Streamer (Android client)
Vendor of Product: Sindre Mehus
Version(s) Affected: 4.4 and below (latest as of Sept 4, 2018)

CVE: CVE-2018-15898
Status: Still unpatched as of time of writing
Vulnerability Type: CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
Attack Type: Remote
Attack Vectors: To exploit the vulnerability, a MITM attacker can provide
any untrusted or expired certificate to the client.

Discoverer: Andrew Klaus (andrewklaus@...il.com)

Mitigation: The only mitigation is to not run over an untrusted network or
use an app that does verify the certificate as valid. Another client called
Ultrasonic, available on the Play Store and is Free and Open Source,
successfully verified the server TLS certificate.

Other notes: App hasn't been updated since 2014, so it's unlikely to be
updated any time soon, if at all.
