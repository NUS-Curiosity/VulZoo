         CVE Name       CVE-2018-17281                                        

    Description  There is a stack overflow vulnerability in the               
                 res_http_websocket.so module of Asterisk that allows an      
                 attacker to crash Asterisk via a specially crafted HTTP      
                 request to upgrade the connection to a websocket. The        
                 attacker���s request causes Asterisk to run out of stack       
                 space and crash.                                             

    Resolution  Disable HTTP websocket access by not loading the              
                res_http_websocket.so module or upgrade Asterisk to a fixed   
                version.
