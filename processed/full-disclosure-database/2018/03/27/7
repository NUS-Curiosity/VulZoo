DSA-2018-058: Dell EMC ScaleIO Multiple Security Vulnerabilities

Dell EMC Identifier: DSA-2018-058
CVE Identifier: CVE-2018-1205, CVE-2018-1237, CVE-2018-1238
Severity: Medium
Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: See below for CVSS v3 scores

Affected products:  
Dell EMC ScaleIO versions prior to 2.5  

Summary:  
Dell EMC ScaleIO customers are encouraged to update to ScaleIO v2.5, which contains fixes for multiple security vulnerabilities in earlier ScaleIO software versions that could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system. 

Details:  
The vulnerability details are as follows:

*	Buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2018-1205) 
Dell EMC ScaleIO, versions prior to 2.5, do not properly handle some packet data in the MDM service. As a result, a remote attacker could potentially send specifically crafted packet data to the MDM service causing it to crash.
CVSSv3 Base Score: 5.9 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

*	Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts Vulnerability  (CVE-2018-1237) 
Dell EMC ScaleIO versions prior to 2.5, contain improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts on the Light installation Agent (LIA). This component is deployed on every server in the ScaleIO cluster and is used for central management of ScaleIO nodes. A remote malicious user, having network access to LIA, could potentially exploit this vulnerability to launch brute force guessing of user names and passwords of user accounts on the LIA.
CVSSv3 Base Score: 5.9 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

*	Command injection vulnerability (CVE-2018-1238)
Dell EMC ScaleIO versions prior to 2.5, contain a command injection vulnerability in the Light Installation Agent (LIA). This component is used for central management of ScaleIO deployment and uses shell commands for certain actions. A remote malicious user, with network access to LIA and knowledge of the LIA administrative password, could potentially exploit this vulnerability to run arbitrary commands as root on the systems where LIAs are installed.
CVSSv3 Base Score: 6.6 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
