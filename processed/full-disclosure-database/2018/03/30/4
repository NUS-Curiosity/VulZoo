[-] Attack Vectors:
– Escalation of Privileges: A normal user can create a bogus (user) account
on Crea8Social platform hence hijack the Admin’s account and takeover the
whole installation.
– Client Side JS Code Execution: A normal user can create a bogus (user)
account on Crea8Social platform with a stored XSS attack vector which will
lead to execute JS code on behalf of all the user types passing by the
attacker’s public user profile page.
– Information Disclosure: A normal user can create a bogus (user) account
on Crea8Social platform with a rough stored XSS attack vector to perform
client side js code execution on other users sessions hence steal their
session cookie or their private information from their accounts.

[-] Fix Suggestion:
Filter and sanitize all the user supplied inputs.
