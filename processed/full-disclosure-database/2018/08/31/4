CA20180829-02: Security Notice for CA Unified Infrastructure Management

Issued: August 29, 2018
Last Updated: August 29, 2018

CA Technologies Support is alerting customers to multiple potential 
risks with CA Unified Infrastructure Management. Multiple 
vulnerabilities exist that can allow an attacker, who has access to 
the network on which CA UIM is running, to run arbitrary CA UIM 
commands on machines where the CA UIM probes are running.  An attacker 
can also gain access to other machines running CA UIM and access the 
filesystems of those machines.

The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-13819, has a medium risk rating and 
concerns a hardcoded secret key, which can allow an attacker to access 
sensitive information.

The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-13820, has a medium risk rating and 
concerns a hardcoded passphrase, which can allow an attacker to access 
sensitive information.

The third vulnerability, CVE-2018-13821, has a high risk rating and 
concerns a lack of authentication, which can allow a remote attacker 
to conduct a variety of attacks, including file reading/writing.


Risk Rating

Cumulative risk rating of High.


Platform(s)

All supported platforms


Affected Products

CA Unified Infrastructure Management 8.5.1, 8.5, 8.4.7


Unaffected Products

CA Unified Infrastructure Management 8.5.1, 8.5, 8.4.7 with the 
solutions listed below applied. 


How to determine if the installation is affected

Review the UIM Vulnerability Patch 1 documentation [1] to determine if 
all appropriate patches have been applied.  Additionally, review 
KB000111575: CA UIM Best Practices For Secure Environments [2] and CA 
UIM Best Practices for Securing Environments to mitigate 
CVE-2018-13821 [3] to ensure that all best practices have been 
implemented.


Solution

Two solutions are available for CA UIM 8.5.1, CA UIM 8.5, and CA UIM 
8.4.7 to resolve these vulnerabilities.  Both solutions, UIM 
Vulnerability Patch 1, and UIM Best Practices for Secure Environments, 
must be implemented to effectively mitigate all three vulnerabilities.

* CA recommends installing UIM Vulnerability Patch 1 [1] to resolve 
CVE-2018-13819 and CVE-2018-13820 as soon as possible.  From the 
download link, select the directory that corresponds to your release 
to access the patch package.

* CA recommends securing the CA UIM deployment using the best 
practices described in KB000111575: CA UIM Best Practices For Secure 
Environments [2] and CA UIM Best Practices for Securing Environments 
to mitigate CVE-2018-13821 [3].

- -OR-

If you feel the best practice recommendations are insufficient for 
your specific security needs, please contact CA Support to install and 
configure the CA UIM Secure Bus 8.01.

Note: While the secured version of the message bus has additional 
security features (e.g. encrypting all UIM traffic from robot to hub), 
the implementation requires additional prerequisites (such as 
requiring user-provided, signed X.509 certificates) and may have 
reduced functionality compared to the standard message bus. 

Customers running any End of Service (EOS) release are strongly 
advised to upgrade to version 8.5.1 and take the remediation actions 
listed above to resolve the vulnerabilities immediately.  

For the most up-to-date information about these CA Unified 
Infrastructure Management vulnerabilities, and for other important 
product information, please see the CA Unified Infrastructure 
Management Support page [4].
