Severity:  High

 
Severity Rating:  View details below for individual CVSS Score for each CVE.

 
Affected Products:

RSA BSAFE Crypto-C Micro Edition versions prior to 4.0.5.3 (CVE-2018-11056, CVE-2018-11058)
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite versions prior to 4.1.6.1 in the 4.1.x series (CVE-2018-11055, CVE-2018-11056, CVE-2018-11057)
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite version 4.1.6 (CVE-2018-11054)
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite versions prior to 4.1.6 in the 4.1.x series (CVE-2018-11058)
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite versions prior to 4.0.11 in the 4.0.x series (CVE-2018-11055, CVE-2018-11057, CVE-2018-11058)
 

Summary:

RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite and Crypto-C Micro Edition contain fixes for multiple security vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected systems.

 

Details:

Integer overflow vulnerability - CVE-2018-11054 
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite, version 4.1.6, contains an integer overflow vulnerability. A remote attacker could use maliciously constructed ASN.1 data to potentially cause a Denial Of Service. 
CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
 

Improper Clearing of Heap Memory Before Release ('Heap Inspection') - CVE-2018-11055 
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite, versions prior to 4.0.11 (in 4.0.x) and prior to 4.1.6.1 (in 4.1.x), contains an Improper Clearing of Heap Memory Before Release ('Heap Inspection') vulnerability. Decoded PKCS #12 data in heap memory is not zeroized by MES before releasing the memory internally and a malicious local user could gain access to the unauthorized data by doing heap inspection.
CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 4.4 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
 

Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') - CVE-2018-11056 
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite, prior to 4.1.6.1 (in 4.1.x), and RSA BSAFE Crypto-C Micro Edition versions prior to 4.0.5.3 (in 4.0.x) contain an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion') vulnerability when parsing ASN.1 data. A remote attacker could use maliciously constructed ASN.1 data that would exhaust the stack, potentially causing a Denial Of Service.
CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
 

Covert Timing Channel - CVE-2018-11057 
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite, versions prior to 4.0.11 (in 4.0.x) and prior to 4.1.6.1 (in 4.1.x) contains a Covert Timing Channel vulnerability during RSA decryption, also known as a Bleichenbacher attack on RSA decryption. A remote attacker may be able to recover a RSA key.
CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 5.9 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
 

Buffer over-read - CVE-2018-11058
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite, versions prior to 4.0.11 (in 4.0.x) and prior to 4.1.6 (in 4.1.x), and RSA BSAFE Crypto-C Micro Edition, version prior to 4.0.5.3 (in 4.0.x) contain a Buffer Over-Read vulnerability when parsing ASN.1 data. A remote attacker could use maliciously constructed ASN.1 data that would result in such issue.
CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
 
 

Recommendation:

The following RSA Micro Edition Suite release contains resolutions to these vulnerabilities:

RSA BSAFE Crypto-C Micro Edition version 4.0.5.3
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite version 4.0.11
RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite version 4.1.6.1

RSA recommends all customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity.
