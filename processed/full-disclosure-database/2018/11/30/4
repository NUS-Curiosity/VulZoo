1. Description

Tarantella Enterprise before 3.11 allows Directory Traversal via a full
pathname preceded by the ./ sequence, as demonstrated by a
"/cgi-bin/secure/ttawlogin.cgi/?action=start&pg=./" substring.

A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access
files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By
manipulating variables that reference files with "dot-dot-slash (../)"
sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be
possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system
including application source code or configuration and critical system
files. It should be noted that access to files is limited by system
operational access control (such as in the case of locked or in-use files
on the Microsoft Windows operating system). The cgi ttawlogin.cgi can read
files if use "./" in the petition.


2. Proof of Concept

http://x.x.x.x/tarantella/cgi-bin/secure/ttawlogin.cgi/?action=start&pg=./fileexist
or (./../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd)

3. Solution:

The product is discontinued.
