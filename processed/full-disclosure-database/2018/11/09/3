Version 1.03 r0098
http://us.dlink.com/products/business-solutions/central-wifimanager-software-controller/

D-Linkâ€™s free Central WiFiManager is a web-based wireless Access Point
management tool, enabling you to create and manage multi-site,
multi-tenancy wireless networks.


[Vulnerability Type]
Server Side Request Forgery


[Affected Component]
MailConnect


[CVE Reference]
CVE-2018-15517


[Security Issue]
Using a web browser or script SSRF can be initiated against
internal/external systems to conduct port scans by leveraging D-LINKs
MailConnect component.

The MailConnect feature on D-Link Central WiFiManager CWM-100 1.03 r0098
devices is intended to check a connection to an SMTP server but actually
allows
outbound TCP to any port on any IP address, leading to SSRF, as
demonstrated by an index.php/System/MailConnect/host/
127.0.0.1/port/22/secure/ URI.
This can undermine accountability of where scan or connections actually
came from and or bypass the FW etc. This can be automated via script or
using Web Browser.
