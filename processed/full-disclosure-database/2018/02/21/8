         CVE Name       CVE-2018-7287                                         

    Description  When reading a websocket, the length was not being checked.  
                 If a payload of length 0 was read, it would result in a      
                 busy loop that waited for the underlying connection to       
                 close.                                                       

    Resolution  A patch to asterisk is available that checks for payloads of  
                size 0 before attempting to read them. By default, Asterisk   
                does not enable the HTTP server, which means it is not        
                vulnerable to this problem. If the HTTP server is enabled,    
                you can disable it if you do not need it. Otherwise, the      
                patch provided with this security vulnerability can be        
                applied. Either of these approaches will resolve the          
                problem.
