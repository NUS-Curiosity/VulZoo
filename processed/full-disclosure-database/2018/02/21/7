         CVE Name       CVE-2018-7286                                         

    Description  A crash occurs when a number of authenticated INVITE         
                 messages are sent over TCP or TLS and then the connection    
                 is suddenly closed. This issue leads to a segmentation       
                 fault.                                                       

    Resolution  A patch to asterisk is available that prevents the crash by   
                locking the underlying transport until a response is sent.
