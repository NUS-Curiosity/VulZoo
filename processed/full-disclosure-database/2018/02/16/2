F-Secure Radar Persistent Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability

CVE-2018-6189
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-6189

# Summary
The application can suggest metadata tags for assets, and in doing so it can execute JavaScript entered previously by a malicious user.

# Vendor Description
F-Secure Radar is a turnkey vulnerability scanning and management platform. It allows you to identify and manage both internal and external threats, report risks, and be compliant with current and future regulations (such as PCI and GDPR compliance). It gives you visibility into shadow IT - to map your full attack surface and respond to critical vulnerabilities associated with cyber threats.

# Remediation
F-Secure has remediated this issue; no action required for cloud users or on-premise users receiving updates.

# Technical Details

The frontend application issues a PUT request to the server when metadata tags are updated:
PUT /api/latest/vulnerabilityscans/tags/batch HTTP/1.1
Host: portal.radar.f-secure.com
[...]

The Tags parameter in the JSON request body can be modified to contain arbitrary JavaScript, e.g.:
[...], "Tags":["<img src=a onerror=\"alert(1)\">"], [...]

This script will execute whenever the frontend attempts to suggest tags, e.g. when a user opts to add tags to a new asset.
