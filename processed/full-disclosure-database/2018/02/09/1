CVE Reference:
==============
CVE-2018-6461


Security Issue:
================
Non privileged user can write files to "C:\ProgramData\March
Hare\myrepo\CVSROOT" to gain authenticated access with the same
privileges
as the current logged on user, in addition they can run arbitrary code
with same privileges as that of the victim.

e.g.

C:\ProgramData\March Hare\myrepo\CVSROOT>cacls * | more
C:\ProgramData\March Hare\myrepo\CVSROOT\CVS Everyone:(OI)(CI)F
                                             NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F


WinCVS:
Attackers can place a malicious DLLs in CVSROOT and wait for CVS user
to run WINCVS, then when browse to a repository in CVSROOT and right
click on
CVSROOT or a CVSROOT file to 'Open in new instance' or Ctrl+F2 then
the attackers DLL will execute.

Attacker supplied DLL e.g. 'python31.dll' will execute if placed on
victims desktop and user initially opens 'wicvs2.exe'.
basically anywhere or repository we can place malicious DLL that they
can browse to should work.

WinMerge 2009 also vulnerable:
If a WinMerge project file is opened from a remote share where
specific attacker supplied DLLs have been placed it will load and
execute it.

vuln DLL(s):
============
tcl87.dll
python30.dll
python31.dll

Basically anywhere or any repository we can place malicious DLL that
they can browse to should work.
