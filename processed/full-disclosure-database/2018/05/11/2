Subject: [FD] Vulnerabilities in IBMs Flashsystems and Storwize Products

*Vulnerabilities in IBMs Flashsystems and Storwize
Products-------------------------------------------------------------------------Introduction============Vulnerabilities
were identified in the IBM Flashsystem 840, IBM Flashsystem 900 and IBM
Storwize V7000. These were discovered during a black box assessment and
therefore the vulnerability list should not be considered exhaustive;
observations suggest that it is likely that further vulnerabilities exist.
It is strongly recommended that IBM Corporation undertakes a full whitebox
security assessment of this application.The version under test was
indicated as: 1.6.2.2 build 18Affected Software And
Versions==============================- IBM Flashsystem 900- IBM

Details=====================---------------------------------------------CVE-2018-1438.
Unauthenticated arbitrary file read on V7000 Unified allowing storage data
access---------------------------------------------On the IBM V7000 Unified
System the web handler /DLSnap does not require authentication and allows
to read arbitrary files from the system as "root", including the data
stored in the storage system from the mounted shares.GET

Unauthenticated file read via the DownloadFile Handler / Authenticated
arbitrary file read via the DownloadFile Handler on v7000
Unified--------------------------------------------------In case of the
following list of products, the DownloadFile handler allows unauthenticated
file reading under the "webadmin" user:IBM Flashsystem 900IBM Flashsystem

HTTP/1.1Host: v7k01n02Connection: closeAccept-Encoding: gzip,
deflateAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9On the V7000 Unified the same request
handler allows reading arbitrary files under the "root" user, however
authentication is required here:GET /DownloadFile?filename=/etc/shadowHost:

en-US,en;q=0.9Cookie:
<redacted>-----------------------------------------------CVE-2018-1434: Web
interface vulnerable to CSRF
-----------------------------------------------The main web interface on
the V7000 Unified is vulnerable to CSRF and other interfaces seem to be
vulnerable as well. This could allow an external attacker to execute
commands on behalf of a user/administrator of the system and potentially
also access data stored on the system.Example request (using a cross domain
XMLHttpRequest):POST /RPCAdapter HTTP/1.1Host: v7ku01Origin:
https://www.example.com <https://www.example.com>Referer:

Ineffective rBash Configuration
---------------------------------------------On machines with a restricted
bash, a possible escape from rBash looks like the
following:BASH_CMDS[escape]=/bin/bash;escape--------------------------------------------------CVE-2018-1463:
World readable credentials and encryption keys
--------------------------------------------------While some systems have
removed the world-read bit from several files and directories, more
important files which contain application configuration details, passwords
and secret keys are world readable and sometimes also world writable. On
the IBM Flash System, this also includes the storage encryption key.#
Partial directory listing of /persist/ on the Unified system:drwxr-xr-x.  2

Sensitive file disclosure of files readable by root
-----------------------------------------------The setuid binary svc_copy
is a wrapper around the script sw_copy which calls cp on the shell.Creating
a symlink to any file, this file can be copied as root to /dumps and is
world readable/writable (-rw-rw-rw- ):$ ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow$
./svc_copy /tmp/shadow /dumps/The file /dumps/shadow is now world readable
with the permissions (-rw-rw-rw-
)---------------------------------------------CVE-2018-1495: Arbitrary file
deletion ---------------------------------------------The setuid binary
log_cleanup is a wrapper around log_cleanup.pyThis binary wipes the
directories /dumps or /tmp and has an undocumented feature "-s" (delete
target of symlink).The following command deletes an arbitrary file (e.g.
/etc/shadow):$ ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow$ ./log_cleanup -sSelect /tmp
as target directory to be
wiped--------------------------------------------------CVE-2018-1467:
Unauthenticated information disclosure
--------------------------------------------------Some web handlers on the
V7000 Unified expose system configuration without authentication which
could be used by an attacker to collect vital details about the
environment.https://v7ku01/SonasInfoServlet?challenge=1

Unprivileged web server process may read SSL private key
-----------------------------------------------The current private key for
the installed SSL certificate on the V7000 FC CE Cannister Node is readable
by the webadmin user:-rw-r----- 1 webadmin 1000 1679 Aug 15 09:47
/dev/server.keyAs a result the file can be read through vulnerabilities in
the web application, e.g. via the DownloadFile handler (see separate
issue).Certificate details:Validity: 15 yearsSubject: C=GB, L=Hursley,
O=IBM, OU=SSG, CN=2076, emailAddress=support@....com
<support@....com>---------------------------------------------CVE-2018-1466:
Weak password hashing algorithm used
---------------------------------------------The root password on the V7000
(CE) FC Cannister and Flash System nodes (and probably others, too) are
hashed with a weak algorithm (DES) instead of the SHA512 which is the
system's default according to
/etc/login.defs.--------------------------------------------------CVE-2018-1461:
Missing Security Related HTTP Headers
--------------------------------------------------XSS Protection HTTP
HeaderThe XSS Filter is a feature that is built into modern web browsers
and is meant to prevent reflective Cross Site Scripting attacks. This
feature can be explicitly turned on (and also off) by using the HTTP header
X-XSS-Protection.X-Content-Type HeaderTo make MIME type confusion attacks
harder, the HTTP header X-Content-Type-Options can be set. This header
prevents trusting the user provided MIME type and instead guessing the MIME
type of the server response.Author======The vulnerabilities were discovered
by Sebastian Neuner (@sebastian9er) and Jan Bee from the Google Security
Team.Timeline========2018/01/26 - Security report sent to psirt@...ibm.com
