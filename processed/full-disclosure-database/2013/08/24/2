Hash: SHA1

CVE-2013-2193: Apache HBase Man in the Middle Vulnerability

Severity: Severe

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
All versions of HBase 0.92.x prior to 0.92.3.
All versions of HBase 0.94.x prior to 0.94.9.

Users affected: Users who have enabled HBase's Kerberos security features
and who run HBase co-located on a cluster with Hadoop MapReduce or Hadoop
YARN.

Impact: RPC traffic from clients to Region Servers may be intercepted by a
malicious user with access to run tasks or containers on a cluster.

Description:
The Apache HBase RPC protocol is intended to provide bidirectional
authentication between clients and servers. However, a malicious server or
network attacker can unilaterally disable these authentication checks. This
allows for potential reduction in the configured quality of protection of
the RPC traffic, and privilege escalation if authentication credentials are
passed over RPC.

Mitigation:
Users of HBase 0.92.x versions prior to 0.92.3 should immediately upgrade
to 0.92.3 when it becomes available, or to 0.94.9 or later.
Users of HBase 0.94.x versions prior to 0.94.9 should immediately upgrade
to 0.94.9 or later.
