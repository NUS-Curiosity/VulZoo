 Vulnerability in LIXIL Satis Toilet

Trustwave SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2013-020:
Hard-Coded Bluetooth PIN Vulnerability in LIXIL Satis Toilet

Published: 08/01/13
Version: 1.0

Vendor: LIXIL Corporation
Product: Satis
Version affected: Unknown

Product description:
The Satis is a "smart" toilet. It is controlled using LIXIL's "My Satis"
Android application, which communicates with the toilet using Bluetooth.

Finding 1: Hard-Coded Bluetooth PIN
*****Credit: Daniel Crowley of Trustwave SpiderLabs
CVE: CVE-2013-4866
CWE: CWE-259

The "My Satis" Android application has a hard-coded Bluetooth PIN of "0000"
as can be seen in the following line of decompiled code from the
application:

BluetoothDevice localBluetoothDevice =
BluetoothManager.getInstance().execPairing(paramString, "0000")

As such, any person using the "My Satis" application can control any Satis
toilet. An attacker could simply download the "My Satis" application and
use it to cause the toilet to repeatedly flush, raising the water usage and
therefore utility cost to its owner.

Attackers could cause the unit to unexpectedly open/close the lid, activate
bidet or air-dry functions, causing discomfort or distress to user.
