 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:222
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : puppet
 Date    : August 27, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated puppet and puppet3 package fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled the resource_type
 service. A local attacker on the master could use this issue to
 execute arbitrary Ruby files (CVE-2013-4761).
 
 It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled permissions on the
 modules it installed. Modules could be installed with the permissions
 that existed when they were built, possibly exposing them to a local
 attacker (CVE-2013-4956).
