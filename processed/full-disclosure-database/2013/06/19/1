Multiple issues were discovered in the TIFF tools, a set of utilities for
TIFF image file manipulation and conversion.

CVE-2013-1960

    Emmanuel Bouillon discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the
    tp_process_jpeg_strip function in the tiff2pdf tool.  This could
    potentially lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

    Emmanuel Bouillon discovered many stack-based buffer overflows in
    the tiff tools.  These issues could potentially lead to a crash or
    arbitrary code execution.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze9.
