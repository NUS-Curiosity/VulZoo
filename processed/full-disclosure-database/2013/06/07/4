Thank's to King Cope for announcing the PoC which affected Plesk versions
mentioned that's having the PHP's CGI CVE-2012-1823 vulnerability.
Plesk is vulnerable to this flaw disregards on the its php configuration,
and is a must fix.
I suggest Plesk to quick patch this zeroday since a lot of vulnerable
servers already spotted in my territory already with the collection of the
malware injected.

You can use the PHP CGI Argument Injection metasploit modules to reproduce
the flaw:
http://www.metasploit.com/modules/exploit/multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection
Any mitigation method forCVE-2012-1823 can be used for the temporary
solution, i.e.: http://eindbazen.net/2012/05/php-cgi-advisory-cve-2012-1823/

The details of php flaw itself can be viewed here:
http://www.metasploitminute.com/2012/05/cve-2012-1823-php-cgi-bug.html
reflected into the module source code below:
https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/multi/http/php_cgi_arg_injection.rb

The point is how CVE-2012-1823 can still be applied to the vulnerable php
based panels, whether other products are affected or not is worth to check.

Thank's to King Cope for announcing the flaw. To Nicolas Krassas, Bart
Blaze & Larry W Cashdollar, for helping in checking this important flaw.

rgds,
