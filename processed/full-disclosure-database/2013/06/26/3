Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-free vulnerabilities, missing permission checks, incorrect 
memory handling and other implementaton errors may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, information disclosure or
cross-site request forgery.

The iceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no
longer supported with security updates.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.7esr-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.7esr-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.
