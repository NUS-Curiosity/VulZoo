Package        : puppet
Vulnerability  : code execution
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-3567

It was discovered that puppet, a centralized configuration management
system, did not correctly handle YAML payloads. A remote attacker could
use a specially-crafted payload to execute arbitrary code on the puppet
master.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze8.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.18-5.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.
