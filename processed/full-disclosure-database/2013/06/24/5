 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in the Linux
 kernel:
 
 The scm_set_cred function in include/net/scm.h in the Linux kernel

 Integer overflow in the fb_mmap function in drivers/video/fbmem.c in
 the Linux kernel before 3.8.9, as used in a certain Motorola build
 of Android 4.1.2 and other products, allows local users to create
 a read-write memory mapping for the entirety of kernel memory,
 and consequently gain privileges, via crafted /dev/graphics/fb0
 mmap2 system calls, as demonstrated by the Motochopper pwn
 program. (CVE-2013-2596)
 
 arch/x86/kernel/cpu/perf_event_intel.c in the Linux kernel before
 3.8.9, when the Performance Events Subsystem is enabled, specifies
 an incorrect bitmask, which allows local users to cause a denial of
 service (general protection fault and system crash) by attempting to
 set a reserved bit. (CVE-2013-2146)
 
 The perf_swevent_init function in kernel/events/core.c in the Linux
 kernel before 3.8.9 uses an incorrect integer data type, which allows
 local users to gain privileges via a crafted perf_event_open system
 call. (CVE-2013-2094)
 
 The ioapic_read_indirect function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux
 kernel through 3.8.4 does not properly handle a certain combination
 of invalid IOAPIC_REG_SELECT and IOAPIC_REG_WINDOW operations, which
 allows guest OS users to obtain sensitive information from host OS
 memory or cause a denial of service (host OS OOPS) via a crafted
 application. (CVE-2013-1798)
 
 Use-after-free vulnerability in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel
 through 3.8.4 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host
 OS memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
 crafted application that triggers use of a guest physical address (GPA)
 in (1) movable or (2) removable memory during an MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME
 kvm_set_msr_common operation. (CVE-2013-1797)
 
 The kvm_set_msr_common function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux
 kernel through 3.8.4 does not ensure a required time_page alignment
 during an MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME operation, which allows guest OS users
 to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and host OS memory
 corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
 application. (CVE-2013-1796)
 
 The do_tkill function in kernel/signal.c in the Linux kernel before
 3.8.9 does not initialize a certain data structure, which allows
 local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via
 a crafted application that makes a (1) tkill or (2) tgkill system
 call. (CVE-2013-2141)
 
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the tg3_read_vpd function in
 drivers/net/ethernet/broadcom/tg3.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.6
 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service
 (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted firmware
 that specifies a long string in the Vital Product Data (VPD) data
 structure. (CVE-2013-1929)
 
 The main function in tools/hv/hv_kvp_daemon.c in hypervkvpd, as
 distributed in the Linux kernel before 3.8-rc1, allows local users
 to cause a denial of service (daemon exit) via a crafted application
 that sends a Netlink message. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because
 of an incorrect fix for CVE-2012-2669. (CVE-2012-5532)
 
 The udf_encode_fh function in fs/udf/namei.c in the Linux kernel
 before 3.6 does not initialize a certain structure member, which
 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel heap
 memory via a crafted application. (CVE-2012-6548)
 
 The isofs_export_encode_fh function in fs/isofs/export.c in the Linux
 kernel before 3.6 does not initialize a certain structure member,
 which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel
 heap memory via a crafted application. (CVE-2012-6549)
 
 net/dcb/dcbnl.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.4 does not
 initialize certain structures, which allows local users to obtain
 sensitive information from kernel stack memory via a crafted
 application. (CVE-2013-2634)
 
 The rtnl_fill_ifinfo function in net/core/rtnetlink.c in the Linux
 kernel before 3.8.4 does not initialize a certain structure member,
 which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel
 stack memory via a crafted application. (CVE-2013-2635)
 
 fs/ext3/super.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.4 uses incorrect
 arguments to functions in certain circumstances related to printk
 input, which allows local users to conduct format-string attacks and
 possibly gain privileges via a crafted application. (CVE-2013-1848)
 
 The flush_signal_handlers function in kernel/signal.c in the Linux
 kernel before 3.8.4 preserves the value of the sa_restorer field across
 an exec operation, which makes it easier for local users to bypass
 the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application containing
 a sigaction system call. (CVE-2013-0914)
 
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the wdm_in_callback function in
 drivers/usb/class/cdc-wdm.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.4 allows
 physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (system
 crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted cdc-wdm USB
 device. (CVE-2013-1860)
 
 Race condition in the install_user_keyrings function in
 security/keys/process_keys.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.3 allows
 local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
 and system crash) via crafted keyctl system calls that trigger keyring
 operations in simultaneous threads. (CVE-2013-1792)
 
 The report API in the crypto user configuration API in the Linux
 kernel through 3.8.2 uses an incorrect C library function for
 copying strings, which allows local users to obtain sensitive
 information from kernel stack memory by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN
 capability. (CVE-2013-2546)
 
 The crypto_report_one function in crypto/crypto_user.c in the report
 API in the crypto user configuration API in the Linux kernel through

 by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. (CVE-2013-2547)
 
 The crypto_report_one function in crypto/crypto_user.c in the report
 API in the crypto user configuration API in the Linux kernel through
 3.8.2 uses an incorrect length value during a copy operation, which
 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory
 by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. (CVE-2013-2548)
 
 The translate_desc function in drivers/vhost/vhost.c in the Linux
 kernel before 3.7 does not properly handle cross-region descriptors,
 which allows guest OS users to obtain host OS privileges by leveraging
 KVM guest OS privileges. (CVE-2013-0311)
 
 Array index error in the __sock_diag_rcv_msg function in
 net/core/sock_diag.c in the Linux kernel before 3.7.10 allows local
 users to gain privileges via a large family value in a Netlink
 message. (CVE-2013-1763)
 
 The __skb_recv_datagram function in net/core/datagram.c in the
 Linux kernel before 3.8 does not properly handle the MSG_PEEK
 flag with zero-length data, which allows local users to cause a
 denial of service (infinite loop and system hang) via a crafted
 application. (CVE-2013-0290)
 
 Use-after-free vulnerability in the shmem_remount_fs function in
 mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel before 3.7.10 allows local users to gain
 privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash) by remounting
 a tmpfs filesystem without specifying a required mpol (aka mempolicy)
 mount option. (CVE-2013-1767)
 
 The xen_iret function in arch/x86/xen/xen-asm_32.S in the Linux
 kernel before 3.7.9 on 32-bit Xen paravirt_ops platforms does not
 properly handle an invalid value in the DS segment register, which
 allows guest OS users to gain guest OS privileges via a crafted
 application. (CVE-2013-0228)
 
 Memory leak in drivers/net/xen-netback/netback.c in the Xen netback
 functionality in the Linux kernel before 3.7.8 allows guest OS users to
 cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering certain
 error conditions. (CVE-2013-0217)
 
 The Xen netback functionality in the Linux kernel before 3.7.8 allows
 guest OS users to cause a denial of service (loop) by triggering ring
 pointer corruption. (CVE-2013-0216)
 
 The __tun_chr_ioctl function in drivers/net/tun.c in the Linux kernel
 before 3.6 does not initialize a certain structure, which allows
 local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory
 via a crafted application. (CVE-2012-6547)
 
 The updated packages provides a solution for these security issues.
