Package        : fail2ban
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2178

Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski discovered a vulnerability in fail2ban, a
log monitoring and system which can act on attack by preventing hosts to
connect to specified services using the local firewall.

When using fail2ban to monitor Apache logs, improper input validation in
log parsing could enable a remote attacker to trigger an IP ban on
arbitrary addresses, thus causing a denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.4-3+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.6-3wheezy2.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your fail2ban packages.
