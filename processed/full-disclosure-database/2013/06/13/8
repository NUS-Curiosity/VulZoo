Package        : dbus
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : local 
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-2168

Alexandru Cornea discovered a vulnerability in libdbus caused by an
implementation bug in _dbus_printf_string_upper_bound(). This
vulnerability can be exploited by a local user to crash system services
that use libdbus, causing denial of service. Depending on the dbus
services running, it could lead to complete system crash.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u1.
