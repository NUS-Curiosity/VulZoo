Subject: [ISecAuditors Security Advisories] Multiple
 Vulnerabilities in Telaen <= 1.3.0

=============================================
INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2013-009
- Original release date: March 15th, 2013
- Last revised:  June 4th, 2013
- Discovered by: Manuel Garcia Cardenas
- Severity: 4,8/10 (CVSS Base Score)
- CVE-ID: CVE-2013-2621,
          CVE-2013-2623,
          CVE-2013-2624
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
Multiple Vulnerabilities in Telaen <= 1.3.0

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
Telaen is a webmail reader application supporting both IMAP and POP3
protocols. It can be installed without dependence of any PHP's extra
modules or a separate database. It is Open source software published
under GNU General Public License (GPL).

The last version of Telaen is 1.3.0 released on January 2012.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
Telaen 1.3.0 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a remote
redirection attack. This flaw exists because the application does not
properly sanitise the file "redir.php".  This allows an attacker to
create a specially crafted URL, that if clicked, would redirect a
victim from the intended legitimate web site to an arbitrary web site
of the attacker's choice.

Aditionaly, it has been detected a reflected XSS vulnerability in
Telaen 1.3.0 and lower versions, that allows the execution of
arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code to be executed in the context of the
victim user's browser. The code injection is done through the
parameter "f_email" in the page index.php.

Due to the errors caused by the application Telaen 1.3.0 and lower
versions, we can display the full webapp installation path.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
REDIRECT:
http://vulnerablesite.com/telaen/redir.php?http://www.malicious-site.com

XSS:
http://vulnerablesite.com/telaen/index.php?tid=default&lid=en_UK&f_email="><script>alert("XSS")</script>

FULL PATH DISCLOSURE: http://vulnerablesite.com/telaen/inc/init.php

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
REDIRECT: An attacker can redirect any user to any malicious website.
Below I have mentioned the vulnerable URL.

XSS: An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in a
targeted user's browser, this can leverage to steal sensitive
information as user credentials, personal data, etc.

FULL PATH DISCLOSURE: An attacker can obtain the full path to the
applitation and if the webroot is getting leaked, attackers may abuse
the knowledge and use it in combination with file inclusion
vulnerabilites to steal configuration files regarding the web
application or the rest of the operating system.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
Versions of Telaen < v1.3.1.

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
REDIRECT AND XSS: All data received by the application and can be
modified by the user, before making any kind of transaction with them
must be validated.

FULL PATH DISCLOSURE: Turn off display errors in the configuration and
unify the error pages.
