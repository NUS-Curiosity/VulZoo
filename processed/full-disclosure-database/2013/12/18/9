	Subway Ordering for California (ZippyYum) 3.4 iOS mobile application

I would like to point out that the statements made in the emails from mikken.tutton@...ersecworldwide.com are untrue at best, defamatory at worst.  I am not going to lambast Jeff, Mikken, or Intersec Worldwide - but I will defend myself.  Normally I would not respond to something like this in a public forum, however, Intersec Worldwide has forced my hand due to their untrue statements.

I never signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement with Intersec Worldwide when I started my contracting work for them.  Now that’s not to say I am going to start publishing all the vulnerabilities of their clients, far from it.  I am stating this because prior to this email going out, I was called by Jeff Tutton the ‘CISO’ about the matter.  We talked briefly for about 10 minutes on Wednesday, December 11, 2013.  During this phone call I mentioned the fact that no NDA had been signed.  He said he would look into this and work with his client on the matter regarding the vulnerability disclosure.  I never heard back from him or anyone at Intersec Worldwide after this.  
 
I emailed Jeff/Intersec this morning when I saw Fyodor’s post and Mikken’s/Intersec email alleging I violated their NDA.  I gave Jeff/Intersec until EOB today to provide the original email with the signed NDA I sent to them, however, I have yet to receive this.  I asked for a copy of the allegedly signed NDA last week as well.  Failure to provide a legitimate copy of my sent email with a signed NDA proves to me that they forgot to have me sign an NDA.  I should not be held liable for a lapse in their own processes.  If they are able to come up with a legitimate copy of the signed NDA and email with legitimate email headers - I will gracefully apologize…which won’t occur since I did not sign such a document.  In this email, I also informed Jeff that I am terminating my 1099/contractor agreement with Intersec Worldwide effective immediately.

Due to the mention of legal action in their email, I have now retained the services of an attorney and will be ready to see this matter to a close.  Instead of focusing on the fact that information was disclosed after they had 6+ months to fix the vulnerability, they should be focusing on the positive aspect that they were able to fix the vulnerability and that it does not affect their product’s current release version.
