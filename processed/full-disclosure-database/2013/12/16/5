Debian Bug     : 711600 732306

Several issues have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MySQL to a new upstream
version, 5.5.33, which includes additional changes, such as performance
improvements, bug fixes, new features, and possibly incompatible
changes. Please see the MySQL 5.5 Release Notes for further details:

 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-32.html
 http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-33.html

In addition this update fixes two issues affecting specifically the
mysql-5.5 Debian package:

A race condition in the post-installation script of the mysql-server-5.5
package creates the configuration file "/etc/mysql/debian.cnf" with
world-readable permissions before restricting the permissions, which
allows local users to read the file and obtain sensitive information
such as credentials for the debian-sys-maint to perform
administration tasks. (CVE-2013-2162)

Matthias Reichl reported that the mysql-5.5 package misses the patches
applied previous in Debian's mysql-5.1 to drop the database "test" and
the permissions that allow anonymous access, without a password, from
localhost to the "test" database and any databases starting with
"test_". This update reintroduces these patches for the mysql-5.5
package.

Existing databases and permissions are not touched. Please refer to the
NEWS file provided with this update for further information.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.33+dfsg-0+wheezy1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), the Debian specific problems will
be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.5 packages.
