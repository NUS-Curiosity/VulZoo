Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:

CVE-2013-6420

    Stefan Esser reported possible memory corruption in
    openssl_x509_parse().

CVE-2013-6712

    Creating DateInterval objects from parsed ISO dates was
    not properly restricted, which allowed to cause a
    denial of service.

In addition, the update for Debian 7 "Wheezy" contains several bugfixes
originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze18.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.6+dfsg-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
