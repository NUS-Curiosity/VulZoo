Package        : drupal6
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-6385 CVE-2013-6386

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Drupal, a fully-featured
content management framework: vulnerabilities due to optimistic cross-site
request forgery protection, insecure pseudo random number generation, code
execution and incorrect security token validation.

In order to avoid the remote code execution vulnerability, it is
recommended to create a .htaccess file (or an equivalent configuration
directive in case you are not using Apache to serve your Drupal sites)
in each of your sites' "files" directories (both public and private, in
case you have both configured).

Please refer to the NEWS file provided with this update and the upstream
advisory at https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-003 for further information.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.29-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 packages.
