 Clipboard security issue

CVE-2013-6237:ISL Light - Desktop 3.5.4, Clipboard security issue


In cases where a person is hosting a sharing session and allows a remote
user to see what is happening on the local PC, it’s been discovered that if
you locally copy something like a hidden password to the local clipboard,
then the remote user will be able to directly paste it in clear text into a
notepad or other form of document, effectively gaining access to the
password. Not possible to lock this functionality.


Example,
1.       You start ISLonline Console session
2.       External consultant joins session using ISLonline Support
3.       You copy a password into your computers copy buffer
      a.       E.g. from KeePass Password Manager
4.       Security issue: External consultants can now paste your password
into e.g. his own Notepad as see it in clear text
      a.      Password is revealed
      b.      The other problem is that password remain in his copy buffer
after session ends
      c.      E.g. KeePass’s auto clean copy buffer feature does not
prevent problem
