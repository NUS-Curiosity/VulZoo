 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2013:287-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : drupal
 Date    : December 17, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple security issues was identified and fixed in drupal:
 
 Drupal core&#039;s Image module allows for the on-demand generation of
 image derivatives. This capability can be abused by requesting a large
 number of new derivatives which can fill up the server disk space,
 and which can cause a very high CPU load. Either of these effects may
 lead to the site becoming unavailable or unresponsive (CVE-2013-0316).
 
 Drupal&#039;s form API has built-in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
 validation, and also allows any module to perform its own validation
 on the form. In certain common cases, form validation functions may
 execute unsafe operations (CVE-2013-6385).
 
 Drupal core directly used the mt_rand() pseudorandom number
 generator for generating security related strings used in several
 core modules. It was found that brute force tools could determine the
 seeds making these strings predictable under certain circumstances
 (CVE-2013-6386).
 
 Image field descriptions are not properly sanitized before they are
 printed to HTML, thereby exposing a cross-site scripting vulnerability
 (CVE-2013-6387).
 
 A cross-site scripting vulnerability was found in the Color module. A
 malicious attacker could trick an authenticated administrative user
 into visiting a page containing specific JavaScript that could lead
 to a reflected cross-site scripting attack via JavaScript execution
 in CSS (CVE-2013-6388).
 
 The Overlay module displays administrative pages as a layer over the
 current page (using JavaScript), rather than replacing the page in
 the browser window. The Overlay module did not sufficiently validate
 URLs prior to displaying their contents, leading to an open redirect
 vulnerability (CVE-2013-6389).
 
 The updated packages has been upgraded to the 7.24 version which is
 unaffected by these security flaws.

 Update:

 Additional apache ACL restrictions has been added to fully conform
 to the SA-CORE-2013-003 advisory.
