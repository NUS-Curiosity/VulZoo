Subject: Apache VCL improper input validation

CVE-2013-0267: Apache VCL improper input validation

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache VCL 2.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, 2.3, 2.3.1

Description:
Some parts of VCL did not properly validate input data. This problem was 
present both in the Privileges portion of the web GUI and in the XMLRPC API.

A malicious user having a minimal level of administrative rights could 
manipulate the data submitted by the web GUI or submit non-standard data to 
the API to gain additional administrative rights.

The API functions that are vulnerable were introduced in 2.3.1.  Some of those 
API functions can also be exploited to perform a DOS attack on the site to 
remove access from other users and to perform an XSS attack to gain elevated 
privileges.

The vulnerabilities were found by an Apache VCL developer doing a code review.  
No know exploits are in the wild at this point.

Fixed Versions:
Apache VCL 2.2.2, 2.3.2

Mitigation:
Apache VCL 2.3 and 2.3.1 users should upgrade to 2.3.2 as soon as possible.
Apache VCL 2.2 and 2.2.1 users should upgrade to 2.2.2 as soon as possible.
Apache VCL 2.1 users should upgrade to 2.2.2 or 2.3.2 as soon as possible.

Apache VCL 2.2.2 and 2.3.2 can be downloaded from 
http://vcl.apache.org/downloads/download.cgi

Workarounds:
There are no complete workarounds. However, users must have at least 
nodeAdmin, manageGroup, resourceGrant, or userGrant to exploit the 
vulnerabilities.  Removing that access from anyone that is not fully trusted 
will minimized chances of an exploit against your site.
