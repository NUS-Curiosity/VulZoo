Package        : xen
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1918 CVE-2013-1952 CVE-2013-1964

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2013-1918 (XSA 45) Several long latency operations are not preemptible

    Some page table manipulation operations for PV guests were not made
    preemptible, allowing a malicious or buggy PV guest kernel to mount a
    denial of service attack affecting the whole system.

CVE-2013-1952 (XSA 49) VT-d interrupt remapping source validation flaw for bridges

    Due to missing source validation on interrupt remapping table
    entries for MSI interrupts set up by bridge devices, a malicious
    domain with access to such a device, can mount a denial of service
    attack affecting the whole system.

CVE-2013-1964 (XSA 50) grant table hypercall acquire/release imbalance

    When releasing a particular, non-transitive grant after doing a grant
    copy operation Xen incorrectly releases an unrelated grant
    reference, leading possibly to a crash of the host system.
    Furthermore information leakage or privilege escalation cannot be
    ruled out.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.11.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-3+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-4.

Note that for the stable (wheezy), testing and unstable distribution,
CVE-2013-1964 (XSA 50) was already fixed in version 4.1.4-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
