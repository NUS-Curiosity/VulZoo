Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive discovered several security issues in
multiple components of the X.org graphics stack and the related
libraries: Various integer overflows, sign handling errors in integer
conversions, buffer overflows, memory corruption and missing input
sanitising may lead to privilege escalation or denial of service.
