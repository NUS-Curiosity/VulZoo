Subject: Q: CVE Database with Programming Language and
	Failure Classification?

Hi All,

Does anyone know where to find an augmented CVE database with: (1)
programming language and (2) failure classification?

For example, CVE-2013-3301 is the Linux kernel, written in C, and the
failure is lack of parameter validation. As another example,
CVE-2013-3302 would also be the Linux kernel, written in C, with a
failure of race condition.

(I'm very interested in aggregated data on all programs/modules
written in C/C++/Objective C).

Jeff
