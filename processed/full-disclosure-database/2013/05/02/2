Package        : stunnel4
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1762
Debian Bug     : 702267

Stunnel, a program designed to work as an universal SSL tunnel for
network daemons, is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability when using
the Microsoft NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication
("protocolAuthentication = NTLM") together with the 'connect' protocol
method ("protocol = connect"). With these prerequisites and using
stunnel4 in SSL client mode ("client = yes") on a 64bit host, an attacker
could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the stunnel
process, if the attacker can either control the specified proxy server or
perform man-in-the-middle attacks on the tcp session between stunnel and
the proxy sever.

Note that for the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable
distribution (sid), stunnel4 is compiled with stack smashing protection
enabled, which should help protect against arbitrary code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:4.29-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:4.53-1.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:4.53-1.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your stunnel4 packages.
