Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote

CVE ID         : CVE-2012-3544 CVE-2013-2067

Two security issues have been found in the Tomcat servlet and JSP engine:

CVE-2012-3544

    The input filter for chunked transfer encodings could trigger high 
    resource consumption through malformed CRLF sequences, resulting in 
    denial of service.

CVE-2013-2067

    The FormAuthenticator module was vulnerable to session fixation.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.0.35-1+squeeze3. This update also provides fixes for 
CVE-2012-2733,CVE-2012-3546,CVE-2012-4431, CVE-2012-4534,CVE-2012-5885,
CVE-2012-5886 and CVE-2012-5887, which were all fixed for stable already.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.0.35-6+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat6 packages.
