end to end privacy is orthogonal to anonymity, however, exit nodes
imply risks most users aren't familiar with or accustomed to.  does
this mean Tor is useless?
  No - but it must be used with care, certainly.

these bugs are short lived but do happen from time to time...  my
favorite will always be CVE-2007-4174  *grin*


next generation low latency anonymity networks are a fun area of
research and suited to interesting attacks. you could help build and
break them when you're sufficiently sated with vague criticisms.
