Package        : openafs
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4134 CVE-2013-4135

OpenAFS, the implementation of the distributed filesystem AFS, has been
updated to no longer use DES for the encryption of tickets. Additional
migration steps are needed to fully set the update into effect. For more
information please see the upstream advisory:
http://www.openafs.org/security/OPENAFS-SA-2013-003.txt

In addition the 'encrypt' option to the 'vos' tool was fixed.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12.1+dfsg-4+squeeze2.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.1-3+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
