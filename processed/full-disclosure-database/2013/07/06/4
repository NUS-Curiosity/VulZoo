                 CVE-2013-1687 CVE-2013-1690 CVE-2013-1692 CVE-2013-1693

Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client. Multiple memory safety 
errors, use-after-free vulnerabilities, missing permission checks, incorrect 
memory handling and other implementaton errors may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code, privilege escalation, information disclosure or
cross-site request forgery.

As already announced for Iceweasel: We're changing the approach for
security updates for Icedove in stable-security: Instead of
backporting security fixes, we now provide releases based on the 
Extended Support Release branch. As such, this update introduces
packages based on Thunderbird 17 and at some point in the future we 
will switch to the next ESR branch once ESR 17 has reached it's end 
of life.

Some Icedove extensions currently packaged in the Debian archive are 
not compatible with the new browser engine. Up-to-date and compatible 
versions can be retrieved from http://addons.mozilla.org as a short 
term solution.

An updated and compatible version of enigmail is included with this 
update.

The icedove version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no
longer supported with full security updates. However, it should be
noted that almost all security issues in Icedove stem from the
included browser engine. These security problems only affect Icedove
if scripting and HTML mails are enabled. If there are security issues
specific to Icedove (e.g. a hypothetical buffer overflow in the IMAP
implementation) we'll make an effort to backport such fixes to oldstable.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.7-1~deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
