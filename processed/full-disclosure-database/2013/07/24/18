Title: AutoCAD DWG-AC1021 Heap Corruption
Product: Autodesk AutoCAD
Advisory ID: BINA-20130724
CVE ID: CVE-2013-3665
Class: Boundary Error Condition (Buffer Overflow)
Vulnerability class: Client side/ file format
Permalink: http://binamuse.com/advisories/BINA-20130724.txt
Vendor notified on: 2013-03-27
Patch/Fix Released: 2013-07-10
Advisory Published: 2013-07-24

Vulnerability Description:

 AutoCAD is a software for computer-aided design (CAD) and technical
drawing in
 2D/3D, being one of the world leading CAD design tools. It is developed and
 sold by Autodesk, Inc.

 AutoCad is vulnerable to an arbitrary pointer dereference vulnerability,
which
 can be exploited by malicious remote attackers to compromise a user's
system.
 This issue is due to AutoCad's failure to properly bounds-check data in a
DWG
 file before using it to index and copy heap memory values. This can be
exploi-
 ted to execute arbitrary code by opening a specially crafted DWG file,
version
 AC1021.

 This version was the native fileformat of AutoCAD Release 2007. New
versions of
 the format emerged but AC1021 is still supported in modern AutoCADs for
back-
 ward compatibility.

Technical Description:

 The R2007 dwg format is composed by sections and pages. Sections come in
two
 flavors system sections and data sections. The system sections contain
informa-
 tion about where the data sections and their pages are in the file.

 The system sections are built based in two main data structures: a first
header
 and a second header. In addition, there are two important sections in the
file
 structure, the page map and the section map. Each one of this sections
should
 be decoded using Reed Solomon algorithm and optionally be compressed with a
 proprietary algorithm (which we will ignore).

 The file structure looks like this:


+------DWG-----------------------------------------------------------------+
  | +-----------------+                 +-------------+
+------------------+ |
  | |   1st Header    |                 |   Page Map  | |   Sections Map
| |
  | +--+--------------+                 +-------------+
+------------------+ |
  +--- |
--------------------------------------------------------------------+
       |

       | Reed Solomon

       |

  +----V--------------------------+      +-------------->|
  |
  |                               |      |               |
  |
  |        Header Values          |      |
+-------------------+
  |                               |      |               |   Page Count
 |
  +-------------------------------+      | Decompress

  |         Header CRC            |      |               |   Page Max ID

+-------------------+
  |                               |      |               |
  |
  |        Second Header          |      |

  |        (Compressed)           +------+               |   Page Map
Offset |
  |                               |
 +-------------------+
  +-------------------------------+                      |   Page Map Len
 |
  |      Second Header CRC        |
 +-------------------+
  +-------------------------------+                      |

 The DWG R2007 also known as AC1021 is well documented by the reversing
effort
 of opendesign. For more detail on this please check http://opendesign.com


 AutoCAD starts by parsing the 1st header. Among other things it reads the
size
 and location of the 2nd header. From the second header it reads the
position in
 the file where the page map is stored, the number of pages present in the
file
 (Page Count) and the maximum page id (Page Max ID) a page shall have. The
page
 map is stored in a single system section page and it is composed by tuples
 (ID, Size) where ID is the page number.

  +-PageMap-------------+
  |    ID    |   Size   |
  +---------------------+
  |    ID    |   Size   |
  +---------------------+
  |    ID    |   Size   |
  +---------------------+

 When each PageMap node is read two data structures are updated, a double
linked
 list of page map nodes called PMapList and an id indexed array of node
pointers
 called PMapArray.

 PMapArray is an array of node pointers maintained for quick access of the
page
 map nodes. It maps the id to the actual page map node. A memory chunk of
 pages-maxid*sizeof(void*) bytes is allocated for it as declared in the 2nd
 header.

 The bug: When each new page map node is created its address is stored in
the
 corresponding id position of the PMapArray array without checking its
 boundaries. Thus, enabling an arbitrary heap offset overwrite with a
pointer
 to the recently created node.
