Package        : nss-pam-ldapd
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-0288
Debian Bug     : 690319

Garth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the
use of FD_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd, which provides NSS and PAM modules for
using LDAP as a naming service, can lead to a stack-based buffer
overflow. An attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to
cause a process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or
potentially execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.15+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss-pam-ldapd packages.
