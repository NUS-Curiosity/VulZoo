Package        : samba
Vulnerability  : several issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-0213 CVE-2013-0214

Jann Horn had reported two vulnerabilities in Samba, a popular
cross-platform network file and printer sharing suite. In particular,
these vulnerabilities affect to SWAT, the Samba Web Administration Tool.

CVE-2013-0213: Clickjacking issue in SWAT
    An attacker can integrate a SWAT page into a malicious web page via a
    frame or iframe and then overlaid by other content. If an 
    authenticated valid user interacts with this malicious web page, she 
    might perform unintended changes in the Samba settings.

CVE-2013-0214: Potential Cross-site request forgery
    An attacker can persuade a valid SWAT user, who is logged in, to
    click in a malicious link and trigger arbitrary unintended changes in
    the Samba settings.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze9.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.6.6-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.6.6-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
