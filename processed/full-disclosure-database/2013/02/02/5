Package        : libupnp4
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-5958 CVE-2012-5959 CVE-2012-5960 CVE-2012-5961

Debian Bug     : 699459

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows were discovered in libupnp4, a library
used for handling the Universal Plug and Play protocol. HD Moore from Rapid7
discovered that SSDP queries where not correctly handled by the
unique_service_name() function.

An attacker sending carefully crafted SSDP queries to a daemon built on
libupnp4 could generate a buffer overflow, overwriting the stack, leading to
the daemon crash and possible remote code execution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0~svn20100507-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0~svn20100507-1.2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.0~svn20100507-1.2.

We recommend that you upgrade your libupnp4 packages.
