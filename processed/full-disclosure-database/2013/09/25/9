About Zabbix

------------



>From Wikipedia : "Zabbix is a network management system application

[...] designed to monitor and track the status of various network

services, servers, and other network hardware."





Vulnerability description

-------------------------



First, once the user is able to open a console session in Zabbix, he or she
can access to the tab (Administration -> Users) where the various users of
the system are displayed.



The user that has been impersonated can view the application source code
finding there the password that interacts Zabbix, for example with the
domain controller.



The field that should be looked for in the source code of the website is
type = "password" id = "ldap_bind_password" name = "ldap_bind_password"
value = <password>.



Another option to discover the password supposes that, once the user
requests the refreshing the web page, the browser asks the user to store or
cache the password.



Affected versions and platforms

-------------------------------



This bug has been verified on the Zabbix 2.0.5. Although the bug can
probably be found in previous versions.




Thank you.
