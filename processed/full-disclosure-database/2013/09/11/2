Package        : exactimage
Vulnerability  : denial of service
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1441

It was discovered that exactimage, a fast image processing library,
does not correctly handle error conditions of the embedded copy of
dcraw. This could result in a crash or other behaviour in an
application using the library due to an uninitialized variable being
passed to longjmp.

This is a different issue than CVE-2013-1438/DSA-2748-1.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.1-3+deb6u3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.5-5+deb7u3.

For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.8.9-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your exactimage packages.
