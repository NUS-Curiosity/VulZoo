Subject: CVE-2012-5649 Apache CouchDB JSONP arbitrary code
	execution with Adobe Flash

CVE-2012-5649

JSONP arbitrary code execution with Adobe Flash

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
 
Affected Versions:
JSONP is supported but disabled by default in all currently supported
releases of Apache CouchDB. Administrator access is required to enable it.
Releases up to and including 1.0.3, 1.1.1, and 1.2.0 are vulnerable, if
administrators have enabled JSONP.

Description:
A hand-crafted JSONP callback and response can be used to run
arbitrary code inside client-side browsers via Adobe Flash.

Mitigation:
Upgrade to a supported release that includes this fix, such as
CouchDB 1.0.4, 1.1.2, 1.2.1, and the future 1.3.x series, all of which
include a specific fix.

Work-Around:
Disable JSONP.
