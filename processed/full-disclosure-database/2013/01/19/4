Package        : asterisk
Vulnerability  : several issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-5976 CVE-2012-5977
Debian Bug     : 697230 698112 698118

The security update released in DSA 2605 for Asterisk, caused a
regression that could lead to crashes. Updated packages have now been
made available to correct that behaviour. For reference, the original
advisory text follows.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Asterisk, a PBX and telephony
toolkit, that allow remote attackers to perform denial of service
attacks.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze10.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.
