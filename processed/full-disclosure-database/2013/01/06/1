Package        : rails
Vulnerability  : input validation error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-5664

joernchen of Phenoelit discovered that rails, an MVC ruby based framework
geared for web application development, is not properly treating
user-supplied input to "find_by_*" methods.  Depending on how the ruby
on rails application is using these methods, this allows an attacker
to perform SQL injection attacks, e.g., to bypass authentication if
Authlogic is used and the session secret token is known.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
ruby-activerecord-2.3 version 2.3.14-3.


We recommend that you upgrade your rails/ruby-activerecord-2.3 packages.
