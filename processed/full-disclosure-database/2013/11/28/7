2. Vulnerability Description
----------------------------

Various components of the LiveZilla application are vulnerable to cross
site scripting.

An attacker can hijack an operator with cross site scripting. For
example his cookie containing parts of the login information can be
retrieved by the attacker that he can later use to login into the
administrator website without entering username and password. When the
attacker enters the script code as the name before connecting and
calling the administrator the cross site scripting vulnerability is
triggered.
The script code will be executed at the administrators chat website.

Example XSS:
'>><img src="foo" onerror="alert('Curesec XSS');"></img>

An attacker is also able to write HTML and script code into the admins
visitor information panel, this allows to completely modify the website
the administrator is viewing and conduct phishing attacks.
Another Cross Site Scripting vulnerability exists in the view archive
section of the windows application.
An attacker can start a chat session that the admin has to accept then
he can send HTML and script code instead of a text message.
When the administrator later clicks into the archive section the HTML
and script code will be executed.
