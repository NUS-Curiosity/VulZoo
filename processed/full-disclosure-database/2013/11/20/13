Package        : curl
Vulnerability  : unchecked ssl certificate host name
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4545

The update for curl in DSA-2798-1 uncovered a regression affecting the
curl command line tool behaviour (#729965). This update disables host
verification too when using the --insecure option.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze6.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy6.

For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, the curl
command line tool behaves as expected with the --insecure option.

For reference the original advisory text follows.

Scott Cantor discovered that curl, a file retrieval tool, would disable
the CURLOPT_SSLVERIFYHOST check when the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER setting
was disabled.  This would also disable ssl certificate host name checks
when it should have only disabled verification of the certificate trust
chain.

The default configuration for the curl package is not affected by this
issue since CURLOPT_SSLVERIFYPEER is enabled by default.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze5.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy5.

For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
has been fixed in version 7.33.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.
