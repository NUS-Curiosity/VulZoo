Package        : torque
Vulnerability  : arbitrary code execution
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4495
Debian Bug     : 729333

Matt Ezell from Oak Ridge National Labs reported a vulnerability in
torque, a PBS-derived batch processing queueing system.

A user could submit executable shell commands on the tail of what is
passed with the -M switch for qsub. This was later passed to a pipe,
making it possible for these commands to be executed as root on the
pbs_server.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1.3.

We recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.
