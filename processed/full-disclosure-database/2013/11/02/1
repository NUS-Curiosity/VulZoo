Package        : nss
Vulnerability  : uninitialized memory read
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1739
Debian Bug     : 726473

A flaw was found in the way the Mozilla Network Security Service library
(nss) read uninitialized data when there was a decryption failure. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service
(application crash) for applications linked with the nss library.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.14.4-1.

The packages in the stable distribution were updated to the latest patch
release 3.14.4 of the library to also include a regression bugfix for a
flaw that affects the libpkix certificate verification cache. More
information can be found via:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NSS/NSS_3.14.4_release_notes

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.15.2-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.15.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.
