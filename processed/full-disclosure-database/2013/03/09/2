Package        : perl
Vulnerability  : rehashing flaw
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1667
Debian Bug     : 702296

Yves Orton discovered a flaw in the rehashing code of Perl. This flaw
could be exploited to carry out a denial of service attack against code
that uses arbitrary user input as hash keys. Specifically an attacker
could create a set of keys of a hash causing a denial of service via
memory exhaustion.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.10.1-17squeeze6.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 5.14.2-19.

We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.
