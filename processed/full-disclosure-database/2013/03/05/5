Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1635 CVE-2013-1643
Debian Bug     : 702221

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, the web scripting
language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:

CVE-2013-1635

    If a PHP application accepted untrusted SOAP object input remotely
    from clients, an attacker could read system files readable for the
    webserver.

CVE-2013-1643

    The soap.wsdl_cache_dir function did not take PHP open_basedir
    restrictions into account. Note that Debian advises against relying
    on open_basedir restrictions for security.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze15.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
