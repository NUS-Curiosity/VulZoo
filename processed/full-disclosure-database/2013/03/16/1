CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1842 CVE-2013-1843
Debian Bug     : 702574

Typo3, a PHP-based content management system, was found vulnerable to several vulnerabilities.

CVE-2013-1842

    Helmut Hummel and Markus Opahle discovered that the Extbase database layer
    was not correctly sanitizing user input when using the Query object model.
    This can lead to SQL injection by a malicious user inputing crafted
    relation values.

CVE-2013-1843

    Missing user input validation in the access tracking mechanism could lead
    to arbitrary URL redirection.
    .
    Note: the fix will break already published links. Upstream advisory on
    http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-core/typo3-core-sa-2013-001/
    has more information on how to mitigate that.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.9+dfsg1-1+squeeze8.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.19+dfsg1-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.19+dfsg1-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your typo3-src packages.
