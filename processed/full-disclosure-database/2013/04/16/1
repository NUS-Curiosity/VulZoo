[ESNC-2013-001] Privilege Escalation in SAP Healthcare Industry Solution

Please refer to www.esnc.de for the original security advisory, updates and
additional information.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Business Impact
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This vulnerability allows bypassing authority checks that exist before
executing a transaction. A transaction in SAP terminology is the execution
of a program.

By exploiting  this vulnerability, an attacker can also control the
transaction to be executed, allowing it to obtain critical rights in the
system and bypassing certain segregation of duties (SoD) restrictions.

Although this vulnerability is found in the SAP industry solution for
healthcare, the functionality is also present in the SAP ERP central
component (ECC 6). Thus, customers in other industries are also affected.

*Risk Level: High*
