 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:104
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : mosh
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated mosh package fixes security vulnerability:
 
 Mosh versions 1.2 and earlier allow an application to cause the
 mosh-server to consume large amounts of CPU time with a short ANSI
 escape sequence. In addition, a malicious mosh-server can cause the
 mosh-client to consume large amounts of CPU time with a short ANSI
 escape sequence. This arises because there was no limit on the value
 of the repeat parameter in some ANSI escape sequences, so even large
 and nonsensical values would be interpreted by Mosh&#039;s terminal emulator
 (CVE-2012-2385).
