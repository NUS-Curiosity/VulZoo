 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:093
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : ircd-hybrid
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated ircd-hybrid packages fix security vulnerability:
 
 Bob Nomnomnom reported a Denial of Service vulnerability in
 IRCD-Hybrid, an Internet Relay Chat server. A remote attacker may use
 an error in the masks validation and crash the server (CVE-2013-0238).
 
 Please note that due to the previously suboptimal nature of the
 sysvinit script, systemd systems would not correctly detect the
 daemon process as  running and thus could not stop the service. As
 a result, you may have to manually kill the process and start the
 service after upgrading (i.e. killall ircd-hybrid; systemctl start
 ircd-hybrid.service).
