 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:095
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : java-1.7.0-openjdk
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated java-1.7.0-openjdk packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 Two improper permission check issues were discovered in the reflection
 API in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use
 these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2012-3174,
 CVE-2013-0422).
 
 Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the AWT,
 CORBA, JMX, Libraries, and Beans components in OpenJDK. An untrusted
 Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java
 sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-0442, CVE-2013-0445, CVE-2013-0441,
 CVE-2013-1475, CVE-2013-1476, CVE-2013-0429, CVE-2013-0450,
 CVE-2013-0425, CVE-2013-0426, CVE-2013-0428, CVE-2013-0444).
 
 Multiple flaws were found in the way image parsers in the 2D and AWT
 components handled image raster parameters. A specially-crafted image
 could cause Java Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly,
 lead to arbitrary code execution with the virtual machine privileges
 (CVE-2013-1478, CVE-2013-1480).
 
 A flaw was found in the AWT component&#039;s clipboard handling code. An
 untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to access
 clipboard data, bypassing Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-0432).
 
 The default Java security properties configuration did not restrict
 access to certain com.sun.xml.internal packages. An untrusted Java
 application or applet could use this flaw to access information,
 bypassing certain Java sandbox restrictions. This update lists the
 whole package as restricted (CVE-2013-0435).
 
 Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the
 JMX, Libraries, Networking, and JAXP components. An untrusted Java
 application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java
 sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-0431, CVE-2013-0427, CVE-2013-0433,
 CVE-2013-0434).
 
 It was discovered that the RMI component&#039;s CGIHandler class used
 user inputs in error messages without any sanitization. An attacker
 could use this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack
 (CVE-2013-0424).
 
 It was discovered that the SSL/TLS implementation in the JSSE component
 did not properly enforce handshake message ordering, allowing an
 unlimited number of handshake restarts. A remote attacker could use
 this flaw to make an SSL/TLS server using JSSE consume an excessive
 amount of CPU by continuously restarting the handshake (CVE-2013-0440).
 
 It was discovered that the JSSE component did not properly validate
 Diffie-Hellman public keys. An SSL/TLS client could possibly use this
 flaw to perform a small subgroup attack (CVE-2013-0443).
 
 Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the JMX
 and Libraries components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application
 or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions
 (CVE-2013-1486, CVE-2013-1484).
 
 An improper permission check issue was discovered in the Libraries
 component in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use
 this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions (CVE-2013-1485).
 
 It was discovered that OpenJDK leaked timing information when
 decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher
 suites were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
 retrieve plain text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL
 server as a padding oracle (CVE-2013-0169).
 
 An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the 2D component
 handled certain sample model instances. A specially-crafted sample
 model instance could cause Java Virtual Machine memory corruption
 and, possibly, lead to arbitrary code execution with virtual machine
 privileges (CVE-2013-0809).
 
 It was discovered that the 2D component did not properly reject certain
 malformed images. Specially-crafted raster parameters could cause Java
 Virtual Machine memory corruption and, possibly, lead to arbitrary
 code execution with virtual machine privileges (CVE-2013-1493).
