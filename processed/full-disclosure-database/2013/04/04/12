Package        : postgresql-9.1
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-1899 CVE-2013-1900 CVE-2013-1901
Debian Bug     : 704479 

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in PostgreSQL database server.

CVE-2013-1899

    Mitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi of NTT Open Source Software Center
    discovered that it was possible for a connection request containing a
    database name that begins with "-" to be crafted that can damage or destroy
    files within a server's data directory. Anyone with access to the port the
    PostgreSQL server listens on can initiate this request.

CVE-2013-1900

    Random numbers generated by contrib/pgcrypto functions may be easy for
    another database user to guess.

CVE-2013-1901

    An unprivileged user could run commands that could interfere with
    in-progress backups

For the stable distribution (squeeze), postgresql-9.1 is not available.
DSA-2657-1 has been released for CVE-2013-1900 affecting posgresql-8.4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1.9-0wheezy1.
