	RTMP Data Processing Object Confusion (CVE-2013-2555)

It was a perfect example of a largely deployed application which utilises security engineers, and has pushed patches/code which was ineffective. My point was that bugs like that are a lot easier to sort in a design or development stage than after the fact when remediation time is tight, and that a 'QA' process of any type will not make up for developer mistakes.
