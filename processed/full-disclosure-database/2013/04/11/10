 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:120
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : python-pycrypto
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated python-pycrypto package fixes security vulnerability:
 
 PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when
 using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature
 space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct
 brute force attacks to obtain the private key (CVE-2012-2417).
 
 Note: any ElGamal keys that have previously been generated by PyCrypto
 should be regenerated after installing this update.
