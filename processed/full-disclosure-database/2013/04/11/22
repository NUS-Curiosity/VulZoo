--- 1. Description ---
Old vulnerability in libc allow to denial of service ftpd in MacOSX 10.8.3.
Officially Apple has resolved this issue in Jun 2011. Apple use tnftpd as a
main ftp server. tnftpd has migrated some functions from libc to own code
(including glob(3)).  Missing patch for resource exhaustion was added in
version 20130322.

To this time, we can use CVE-2010-2632 to denial of service the ftp server.
The funniest is report

http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4723

where CVE-2010-2632 was patched. That true 'libc is patched', but nobody
from Apple has verified ftp. I really don't believe in penetrating testing
form Apple side. Situation don't seems good. I has asked for open source
donations,  unfortunately Apple do not financial help vendors, what use
their software in own products.

Proof of Concept is available since 2010
