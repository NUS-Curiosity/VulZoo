 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:125
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : sleuthkit
 Date    : April 10, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated sleuthkit packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 A security flaw was found in the way the Sleuth Kit (TSK), a collection
 of UNIX-based command line tools allowing to investigate a computer,
 performed management of \&#039;.\&#039; (dotfile) file system entry. An attacker
 could use this flaw to evade detection by forensic analysis (hide
 certain files not to be scanned) by renaming the file in question it
 to be \&#039;.\&#039; file system entry.
 
 The original reports speaks about this attack vector to be present
 when scanning FAT (File Allocation Table) file system. It is possible
 though, the flaw to be present on other file systems, which do not
 reserve usage of \&#039;.\&#039; entry for special purpose, too.
