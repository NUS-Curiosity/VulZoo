 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:083
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : glib2.0
 Date    : April 9, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated glib2.0 packages fix security vulnerability:
 
 It was discovered that the version of glib shipped with MBS 1 does
 not sanitise certain DBUS related environment variables. When used
 in combination with a setuid application which utilises dbus via
 glib, a local user could gain escalated privileges with a specially
 crafted environment. This is related to a similar issue with dbus
 (CVE-2012-3524).
 
 This updated version of glib adds appropriate protection against
 such scenarios and also adds additional hardening when used in a
 setuid environment.
