 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:086
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : groff
 Date    : April 9, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Multiple vulnerabilities has been found and corrected in groff:
 
 contrib/pdfmark/pdfroff.sh in GNU troff (aka groff) before 1.21 allows
 local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a
 pdf#####.tmp temporary file (CVE-2009-5044).
 
 The (1) gendef.sh, (2) doc/fixinfo.sh, and (3)
 contrib/gdiffmk/tests/runtests.in scripts in GNU troff (aka groff)
 1.21 and earlier allow local users to overwrite arbitrary files
 via a symlink attack on a gro#####.tmp or /tmp/##### temporary file
 (CVE-2009-5079).
 
 The (1) contrib/eqn2graph/eqn2graph.sh,
 (2) contrib/grap2graph/grap2graph.sh, and (3)
 contrib/pic2graph/pic2graph.sh scripts in GNU troff (aka groff)
 1.21 and earlier do not properly handle certain failed attempts
 to create temporary directories, which might allow local users
 to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a file in a
 temporary directory, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1296
 (CVE-2009-5080).
 
 The (1) config.guess, (2) contrib/groffer/perl/groffer.pl, and (3)
 contrib/groffer/perl/roff2.pl scripts in GNU troff (aka groff) 1.21
 and earlier use an insufficient number of X characters in the template
 argument to the tempfile function, which makes it easier for local
 users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a temporary
 file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-0969 (CVE-2009-5081).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.
