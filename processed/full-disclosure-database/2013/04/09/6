 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:082
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : gimp
 Date    : April 9, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated gimp packages fix security vulnerabilities:
 
 An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow,
 was found in the GIMP&#039;s GIF image format plug-in. An attacker could
 create a specially-crafted GIF image file that, when opened, could
 cause the GIF plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
 code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP (CVE-2012-3481).
 
 A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP&#039;s KiSS CEL
 file format plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted
 KiSS palette file that, when opened, could cause the CEL plug-in to
 crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
 the user running the GIMP (CVE-2012-3403).
 
 fits-io.c in GIMP before 2.8.1 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash)
 via a malformed XTENSION header of a .fit file, as demonstrated using
 a long string. (CVE-2012-3236)
 
 GIMP 2.8.2 and earlier is vulnerable to memory corruption when
 reading XWD files, which could lead even to arbitrary code execution
 (CVE-2012-5576).
 
 Additionally it fixes partial translations in several languages.
 
 This gimp update provides the stable maintenance release 2.8.2 which
 fixes the above security issues.
