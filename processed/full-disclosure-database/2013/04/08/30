Subject: XSS and FPD vulnerabilities in ZeroClipboard in
	multiple themes for WordPress

Hello list!

These are Cross-Site Scripting and Full path disclosure vulnerabilities in 
multiple themes for WordPress (with ZeroClipboard.swf).

Earlier I've wrote about Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities in 
ZeroClipboard (http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Feb/103). I wrote 
that this is very widespread flash-file and it's placed at tens of thousands 
of web sites. And it's used in hundreds of web applications.

After publishing this and two other advisories related to ZeroClipboard in 
February, I've published last month two new advisories (which I prepared in 
February). About vulnerabilities in WP plugins and in WP themes (with 
ZeroClipboard.swf).

This flash-file is used in hundreds of themes for WordPress (including 
custom themes for different sites). Among them are Montezuma, Striking, 
Couponpress, Azolla, Black and White. And there are many other vulnerable 
themes for WP with ZeroClipboard.swf. Also there is one theme which also 
contains ZeroClipboard10.swf.

SecurityVulns ID: 12910
CVE: CVE-2013-1808

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are the next web applications (WordPress themes) with 
ZeroClipboard:

All versions of Montezuma, Striking, Couponpress, Azolla, Black and White.

Both XSS vulnerabilities in ZeroClipboard are fixed in the last version 
ZeroClipboard 1.1.7. All developers should update swf-file in their 
software. I wrote about developers who begun fixing these vulnerabilities in 
ZeroClipboard in their software 
(http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Mar/207).

----------
Details:
----------

Cross-Site Scripting (WASC-08):

XSS via id parameter and XSS via copying payload into buffer (as described 
in previous advisory).

This is very widespread flash-file (both versions), as you can find out via 
Google dorks. If at searching by standard Goolge dork it's possible to find 
tens thousand of sites with ZeroClipboard.swf or ZeroClipboard10.swf, then 
at searching for themes for WordPress it's possible to find hundreds 
thousand of sites with these flash-files.

inurl:zeroclipboard.swf inurl:/wp-content/themes/ - about 70200 (in 
February, now more)
zeroclipboard.swf inurl:/wp-content/themes/ - about 85600 (in February, now 
more)

Full path disclosure (WASC-13):

All mentioned themes have FPD vulnerabilities in php-files (in index.php and 
others), which is typically for WP themes.

------------
Timeline:
------------ 

2013.02.19 - after contacting with old and new developers of ZeroClipboard, 
I disclosed vulnerabilities in ZeroClipboard to the lists.
2013.02 - in February I wrote two additional advisories about 
vulnerabilities in different web applications with ZeroClipboard to draw 
more attention to this issue concerned with hundreds of web applications.
2013.03.28 - disclosed vulnerabilities in multiple themes for WordPress at 
my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/6401/).
