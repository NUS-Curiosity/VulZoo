three years or more is better of course!  i would not be disappointed
with a dozen months, however.
  alas external factors (especially when licenses are non-exclusive)
complicate longevity of weaponized exploits...


if you really want to improve security:
 a) remove all criminal and civil liability for "hacking", computer
trespass, and all related activities performed over data networks;
establish proactive "shield" legislation to protect and encourage
unrestricted security research of any subject on any network. extend
to international agreements for blanket protection in all
jurisdictions.
 b) establish lock picking, computing, and hacking curriculum in pre
school through grade school with subsidized access to technical
resources including mobile, tablet, laptop test equipment, grid/cloud
computing on-demand, software defined radios with full
receive/transmit, and gigabit internet service or faster.
 c) organize a program of blue and red teaming challenges for
educational and public participation at the district, regional, and
national level cultivating expertise and rewarding it with hacking
toys, access, and monies.

if implemented, i can guarantee a significant and measurable
improvement in the security posture of the systems that remain  in
such an environment.
