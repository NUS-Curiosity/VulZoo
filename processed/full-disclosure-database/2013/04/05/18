 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:044
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : libjpeg
 Date    : April 5, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been discovered and corrected in libjpeg:
 
 A Heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libjpeg-turbo
 decompressed certain corrupt JPEG images in which the component
 count was erroneously set to a large value. An attacker could create
 a specially-crafted JPEG image that, when opened, could cause an
 application using libpng to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary
 code with the privileges of the user running the application
 (CVE-2012-2806).
 
 The updated packages have been patched to correct this issue.
