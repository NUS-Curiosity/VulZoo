 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                       MDVSA-2013:001-1
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : gnupg
 Date    : April 5, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0

 Problem Description:

 A vulnerability has been found and corrected in gnupg:
 
 Versions of GnuPG &lt;= 1.4.12 are vulnerable to memory access violations
 and public keyring database corruption when importing public keys
 that have been manipulated. An OpenPGP key can be fuzzed in such a
 way that gpg segfaults (or has other memory access violations) when
 importing the key (CVE-2012-6085).
