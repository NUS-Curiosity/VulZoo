 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2013:034
 http://www.mandriva.com/en/support/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : cups
 Date    : April 5, 2013
 Affected: Business Server 1.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 Updated cups packages fixes bugs and security vulnerabilities:
 
 During the process of CUPS socket activation code refactoring in favour
 of systemd capability a security flaw was found in the way CUPS service
 honoured Listen localhost:631 cupsd.conf configuration option. The
 setting was recognized properly for IPv4-enabled systems, but failed to
 be correctly applied for IPv6-enabled systems. As a result, a remote
 attacker could use this flaw to obtain (unauthorized) access to the
 CUPS web-based administration interface (CVE-2012-6094). The fix for
 now is to not enable IP-based systemd socket activation by default.
 
 This update adds a patch to correct printing problems with some USB
 connected printers in cups 1.5.4.
 
 Further, this update should correct possible printing problems with
 the following printers since the update to cups 1.5.4.
 
 Canon, Inc. PIXMA iP4200
 Canon, Inc. PIXMA iP4300
 Canon, Inc. MP500
 Canon, Inc. MP510
 Canon, Inc. MP550
 Canon, Inc. MP560
 Brother Industries, Ltd, HL-1430 Laser Printer
 Brother Industries, Ltd, HL-1440 Laser Printer
 Oki Data Corp. Okipage 14ex Printer
 Oki Data Corp. B410d
 Xerox Phaser 3124
 All Zebra devices
 
 Additionally, patches have been added to fix printing from newer apple
 devices and to correct an error in the \%post script which prevented
 the cups service from starting when freshly installed.
