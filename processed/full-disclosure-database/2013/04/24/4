[ESNC-2013-004] Remote ABAP Code Injection in OpenText/IXOS ECM for
SAP NetWeaver

Please refer to http://www.esnc.de for the original security advisory,
updates and additional information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Business Impact
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This vulnerability allows injection of ABAP code to the remote SAP
system. In SAP security, this is the equivalent of getting an
ultra-reliable ring 0 exploit which works through the network and
never crashes.

By exploiting this vulnerability an attacker can e.g. inject code
which saves the passwords of all connecting SAP GUI users in a remote
file, steal or change sensitive data such as HR salary information,
execute bank transactions and transfer money, or simply plant an SAP
backdoor for accessing the system later. The attacker can also
manipulate or corrupt ABAP programs shipped by SAP and make the system
inoperable.

Risk Level: High
