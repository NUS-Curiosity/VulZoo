 RTMP Data Processing Object Confusion (CVE-2013-2555)

I think the definition of 'needless staff' highly depends on whether you
want 'vulnerable software'.

Educating current developers is absolutely a good idea, but still not
foolproof. The bottom line is that if you want safe software, you need
to invest in proper development. As far as I am concerned, for large
companies like Adobe and Oracle, where software bugs in your product
have a direct impact on the safety of your customers, that involves 
hiring specialized staff.
