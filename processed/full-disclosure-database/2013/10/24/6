Subject: [ISecAuditors Security Advisories] HTTP Response
 Splitting Vulnerability in WebCollab <= v3.30

=============================================
INTERNET SECURITY AUDITORS ALERT 2013-011
- Original release date: March 21st, 2013
- Last revised:  March 21st, 2013
- Discovered by: Manuel García Cárdenas
- Severity: 5/10 (CVSS Base Score)
- CVE-ID: CVE-2013-2652
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
HTTP Response Splitting Vulnerability in WebCollab <= v3.30

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
WebCollab is a collaborative Web site for project workgroups. It aims to
be easy and intuitive to

use without being complicated or graphically intensive.

It uses a MySQL/PostgreSQL database backend coupled with PHP scripting
and the Apache webserver.

The last version of WebCollab is 3.30 (Aotuhia) released on February 2013.

III. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
An input validation problem exists within WebCollab which allows
injecting CR (carriage return -

%0D or \r) and LF (line feed - %0A or \n) characters into the server
HTTP response header,

resulting in a HTTP Response Splitting Vulnerability.

The vulnerability exists in the "item" parameter on the page
"/help/help_language.php".

This vulnerability not only gives attackers control of the remaining
headers and body of the

server response, but also allows them to create additional responses
entirely under their

control.

IV. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
Malicious Request:

http://vulnerablesite.com/webcollab/help/help_language.php?item=%0d%0a%20FakeHeader%3a

%20WriteYourOwnHeader&lang=en&type=help

Server Response:

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Server: Apache/2.4.3 (Win32) OpenSSL/1.0.1c PHP/5.4.7
Location: http://vulnerablesite.com/webcollab/help/en_help.php#
 FakeHeader: WriteYourOwnHeader
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/html

V. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
Attacker-supplied HTML or JavaScript code could run in the context of
the affected site,

potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookie-based authentication
credentials, control how

the site is rendered to the user, and influence or misrepresent how web
content is served,

cached, or interpreted. Other attacks are also possible.

VI. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
WebCollab <= v3.30

VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
All data received by the application and can be modified by the user,
before making any kind of
transaction with them must be validated.

Validate the parameter "item" on the page "/help/help_language.php" line 34:

$help_item = $_GET['item'];

switch($_GET['type'] ) {
  case 'admin':
    header('Location:
'.BASE_URL.'help/'.$lang_prefix.'_help_admin.php#'.$help_item );
    break;

  case 'help':
  default:
    header('Location:
'.BASE_URL.'help/'.$lang_prefix.'_help.php#'.$help_item );
    break;
