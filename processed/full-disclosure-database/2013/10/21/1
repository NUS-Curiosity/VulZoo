CVE-2013-4390: Apache Sling open redirect on login

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:  All versions Apache Sling org.apache.sling.auth.core up
to and including version 1.1.2

Description: With some combinations of  a custom login form and XSS the
login form rendered by the Apache Sling Auth Core bundle is attackable with
an open redirect, sending users to any server after a login.

Mitigation: Users of those bundle versions should update to version 1.1.4
of the bundle (http://sling.apache.org/downloads.cgi)
