| OVERVIEW |
+----------+

The release of this advisory provides exploitation details in relation to 
known patched vulnerabilities in Microsoft Silverlight.   These details were 
obtained through the Packet Storm Bug Bounty program and are being released 
to the community.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------+
| DETAILS |
+---------+

A memory disclosure vulnerability exists in the public WriteableBitmap class
from System.Windows.dll. This class allows reading of image pixels from the 
user-defined data stream via the public SetSource() method.

BitmapSource.ReadStream() allocates and returns byte array and a count of array
items as out parameters. These returned values are taken from the input stream
and they can be fully controlled by the untrusted code. When returned "count" 
is greater than "array.Length", then data outside the "array" are used as input 
stream data by the native BitmapSource_SetSource() from agcore.dll. Later all 
data can be viewed via the public WriteableBitmap.Pixels[] property.
