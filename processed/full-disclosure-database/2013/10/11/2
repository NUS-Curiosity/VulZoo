Package        : gnupg
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2013-4351 CVE-2013-4402
Debian Bug     : 725439 722722

Two vulnerabilities were discovered in GnuPG, the GNU privacy guard,
a free PGP replacement. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures 
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2013-4351

   When a key or subkey had its "key flags" subpacket set to all bits
   off, GnuPG currently would treat the key as having all bits set.
   That is, where the owner wanted to indicate "no use permitted",
   GnuPG would interpret it as "all use permitted". Such "no use
   permitted" keys are rare and only used in very special circumstances.

CVE-2013-4402

    Infinite recursion in the compressed packet parser was possible
    with crafted input data, which may be used to cause a denial of
    service.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.10-4+squeeze3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.15-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.
