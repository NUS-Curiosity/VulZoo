 Problem Description:

 Updated clutter packages fix security vulnerability:
 
 A security flaw was found in the way Clutter, an open source software
 library for creating rich graphical user interfaces, used to manage
 translation of hierarchy events in certain circumstances (when

 an error). Physically proximate attackers could use this flaw for
 example to obtain unauthorized access to gnome-shell session right
 after system resume (due to gnome-shell crash) (CVE-2013-2190).
