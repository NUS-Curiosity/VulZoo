Package        : horde3
Vulnerability  : Remote code execution
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-1691
Debian Bug     : 737149

Pedro Ribeiro from Agile Information Security found a possible remote 
code execution on Horde3, a web application framework. Unsanitized
variables are passed to the unserialize() PHP function. A remote attacker
could specially-crafted one of those variables allowing her to load and
execute code.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.8+debian0-3.

In the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, Horde is 
distributed in the php-horde-util package. This problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.0-1. 

We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 packages.
