Introduction:
-------------
Compass Security AG [3] discovered a security flaws in the i-doit CMDB
web application [2], which allows execution of malicious code.


Vulnerable:
-----------
i-doit Pro 1.2.4 and likely all prior versions including i-doit Open.


Description:
------------
The i-doit web application does not properly encode output of user data
in at least one place. Exploiting this vulnerability leads to reflected
cross-site scripting (XSS) and allows execution of JavaScript code in
the context of the user's session, e.g. to impersonate logged-in i-doit
CMDB users.

The vulnerable resource is the 'call' parameter:
/?ajax=1&objID=1753&call=');}</script><script>alert('XSS')</script>


Remediation:
------------
Upgrade to i-doit Pro 1.2.4. The 'Open' flavour will not receive patches
in its current branch any longer, as explained by the vendor.
