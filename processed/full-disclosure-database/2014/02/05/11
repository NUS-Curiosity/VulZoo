Package        : mumble
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0044 CVE-2014-0045
Debian Bug     : 737739

Several issues have been discovered in mumble, a low latency VoIP
client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues:

CVE-2014-0044

    It was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a
    Mumble client could trigger a NULL pointer dereference or an
    out-of-bounds array access. A malicious remote attacker could
    exploit this flaw to mount a denial of service attack against a
    mumble client by causing the application to crash.

CVE-2014-0445

    It was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a
    Mumble client could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow. A
    malicious remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a client
    crash (denial of service) or potentially use it to execute
    arbitrary code.

The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-349-g315b5f5-2.2+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your mumble packages.
