Subject: [CVE-2014-2027] PHP objection insertion /
 arbitrary file deletion / possible RCE in egroupware <= 1.8.005

Hi

Egroupware <= 1.8.005 contains a PHP object insertion vulnerability
via unsafe use of the unserialize() function.

There are lots of classes with magic methods which appear to be
exploitable, some of them possibly for remote code execution. The
advisory linked below contains an example of an arbitrary file
deletion.

The full report can be obtained from my repo in
https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/raw/master/egroupware-1.8.005.txt

The changelog can be seen at http://www.egroupware.org/changelog and
new versions can be obtained from http://www.egroupware.org/download

Regards
Pedro
