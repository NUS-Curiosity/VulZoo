Subject: CVE-2014-0053 Information Disclosure when using
	Grails

CVE-2014-0053 Information Disclosure in Grails applications

Severity: Important

Vendor: Grails by Pivotal

Versions Affected:
- Grails 2.0.0 to 2.3.5

Description:
The Grails resources plug-in, a default dependency of Grails since
2.0.0, does not block access to resources located under /WEB-INF by
default. This means that both configuration files and class files
are publicly accessible when they should be private.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following
mitigations:
- Upgrade to Grails 2.3.6 and redeploy the application
- Configure the resources plugin to block access to /WEB-INF
- Prevent access to /WEB-INF in the reverse proxy (if one is used)

Possible configuration options to block access to /WEB-INF include
adding the following to grails-app/conf/Config.groovy:
grails.resources.adhoc.includes = ['/images/**', '/css/**', '/js/**', '/plugins/**']
grails.resources.adhoc.excludes = ['/WEB-INF/**']
