CVE-2013-4286 Incomplete fix for CVE-2005-2090 (Information disclosure)

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- - Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC1
- - Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.42
- - Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.37

Description:
The fix for CVE-2005-2090 was not complete. It did not cover the
following cases:
- - content-length header with chunked encoding over any HTTP connector
- - multiple content-length headers over any AJP connector

Requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length
header when chunked encoding is being used should be rejected as
invalid. When multiple components (firewalls, caches, proxies and
Tomcat) process a sequence of requests where one or more requests
contain either multiple content-length headers or a content-length
header when chunked encoding is being used and several components do not
reject the request and make different decisions as to which
content-length header to use an attacker can poison a web-cache, perform
an XSS attack and obtain sensitive information from requests other then
their own. Tomcat now rejects requests with multiple content-length
headers or with a content-length header when chunked encoding is being
used.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC3 or later
  (8.0.0-RC2 contains the fix but was not released)
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.47 or later
   (7.0.43 to 7.0.46 contain the fix but were not released)
- - Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 6.0.39 or later
   (6.0.38 contains the fix but was not released)
