Subject: Re: [CVE-2014-1860] PHP object insertion /
 possible RCE in Contao CMS <= 3.2.4

I haven't read the whole thread, so I apologize in advance for commenting
on it. But I think it's important to mention that "not a vulnerability" and
"not exploitable" are entirely different concepts. Since conclusively
proving that a vulnerability is 100% not exploitable for all code paths in
all possible environments is difficult at best (if not downright
impossible), you can still consider something a vulnerability even if you
don't have a proof of concept - you can assign it lower risk, of course,
but it doesn't disappear, because there's at least a theoretical
possibility that it may be exploited.

So, let's not get into a flame war yet. :)
