Subject: CVE-2012-2627 not *really* fixed

On version 11.01 of Sonicwall scrutinizer (downloaded at www.mysonicwall.com),
it seems that the problem was not actually fixed? The open upload handler
still exists, but it fails on the move_uploaded_file line because the
directory that it attempts to move the file to (on linux at least) does not
exist.
