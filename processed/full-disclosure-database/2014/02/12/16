Subject: CVE-2014-1221 - Local Code Execution in Dameware
	Mini Remote Control

Vulnerability title: Code Execution Vulnerability [LCE] in Dameware Mini
Remote Control

CVE: CVE-2014-1221
Vendor: Dameware
Product: Mini Remote Control
Affected Version: 10.0.0.372
Fixed Version: 10.0 Hotfix 3
Reported by: Kyriakos Economou

Details:
Latest version of DameWare MRC v10.0.0.372, and possibly earlier
versions, are vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when attempting to
connect (or chat) to a host imported through a maliciously crafted
MRCCv2.db file containing an invalid + long host name.

        The PoC exploit uses full ROP to bypass DEP + ASLR. Tested in
WinXP SP3 and Win7 (SP0, SP1), all 32-bit builds.

        Furthermore, builds for Linux and Mac are possibly vulnerable to
the same attack.

        The exploit can also be triggered by importing the malicious
file from a remote location.
