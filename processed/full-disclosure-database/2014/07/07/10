Hi @ll,

COMPLETELY outdated and vulnerable 3rd party libraries (as part of
AppleApplicationSupport.msi):

* libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll 0.9.8d

  are more than SEVEN years old and have at least 27 unfixed CVEs!
  the current version is 0.9.8za, see <http://www.openssl.org/news/>


* libcurl.dll 7.16.2

  is more than SEVEN years old and has at least 18 unfixed CVEs!
  the current version is 7.37.0;
  see <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html>
  for the fixed vulnerabilities!

  the current version is 2.9.1, for the latest vulnerability see

stay away from their (Windows) software!
