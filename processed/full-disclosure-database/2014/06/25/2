Subject: [FD] [RT-SA-2013-003] Endeca Latitude Cross-Site Scripting

Advisory: Endeca Latitude Cross-Site Scripting

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
vulnerability in Endeca Latitude. By exploiting this vulnerability an
attacker is able to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context
of other Endeca Latitude users.


Details
=======

Product: Endeca Latitude
Affected Versions: 2.2.2, potentially others
Fixed Versions: N/A
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: N/A
Vendor Status: decided not to fix
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2013-003
Advisory Status: published
CVE:  CVE-2014-2400
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2400


Introduction
============

Endeca Latitude is an enterprise data discovery platform for advanced,
yet intuitive, exploration and analysis of complex and varied data.
Information is loaded from disparate source systems and stored in a
faceted data model that dynamically supports changing data. This
integrated and enriched data is made available for search, discovery,
and analysis via interactive and configurable applications.

(from the vendor's homepage)


More Details
============

Endeca Latitude offers administrators to trigger different functions by
using the following two URLs (see [1]):

 * http://example.com/config?op=<supported-operation>
 * http://example.com/admin?op=<supported-operation>

When accessing such an URL which uses an invalid value for the HTTP GET
parameter "op", such as
http://example.com/config?op=RedTeam%20Pentesting, an error message is
shown by the webapplication and the invalid value is directly embedded
into the document without prior escaping, which leads to a Cross-Site
Scripting vulnerability.


Proof of Concept
================

As shown by the following URL, an attacker is able to embed arbitrary
JavaScript code into the context of the Endeca Latitude instance:

http://example.com/config?op=<script>alert('RedTeam Pentesting');</script>


Workaround
==========

The vendor did not update the vulnerable software, but recommends to
configure all installations to require mutual authentication using TLS
certificates for both servers and clients, while discouraging users from
installing said client certificates in browsers.


Fix
===

Not available. The vendor did not update the vulnerable software to
remedy this issue.


Security Risk
=============

The vulnerability can be used to embed arbitrary JavaScript code and
therefore offers a wide range of possible attacks such as stealing
cookies or displaying a fake login form. Furthermore, an attacker can use
this vulnerability to control the Endeca Latitude instance by using the
API implemented by its web service (see [2]). The risk of this
vulnerability is therefore considered to be high.
