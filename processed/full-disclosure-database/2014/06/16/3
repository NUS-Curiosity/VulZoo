Subject: [FD] [Tool] XXE exploit automation - On The Outside, Reaching In 0.2

This has been my weekend project off and on since February. I would 
still consider it in a "preview" state, but I also think it's far enough 
along to be useful to at least a few people.

The idea behind it is to use a Metasploit-style module system 
specifically for XXE exploit code. This allows a common interface, 
including the ability to automate downloads of numerous files, or 
automatically walk the directory structure if the vulnerable system is 
based on Java.

This initial release includes a number of different modules for four 
different vulnerable software packages:

CVE-2013-6407 - Apache Solr
SOS-12-007 - Squiz Matrix prior to version 4.6.5/4.8.1
CVE-2014-2205 - McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator from 4.6.0 to 4.6.7 (without 
Hotfix 940148)
CVE-2012-2239 - Mahara 1.4.x before 1.4.4, and 1.5.x before 1.5.3

To my knowledge, this is the first public release of exploit code for 
CVE-2013-6407 and CVE-2012-2239.

The Squiz Matrix and Mahara modules make use of On The Outside, Reaching 
In's co-conspirator She Wore A Mirrored Mask, which is an extremely 
lightweight webserver that pretends to be something innocuous (Apache 
Coyote 1.1 by default), but is actually used for Yunusov-Osipov-style 
out-of-band XXE data-exfiltration.

Again, these are really early versions, and the code is a bit of a mess, 
but they do work very effectively, at least if you run them under Python 
2.7.3. The code is GPLv3.

Feedback is appreciated, and if anyone is able to make good use of them 
in a pen-test, I'd love to hear about it.
