To be honest I'm getting rather annoyed by how Check Point is (mis)handling
this vulnerability. I mean, there is already a "cool marketing name", there
is a website dedicated to it, there is already this huge FAQ not answering
the basic questions, etc.
But there is no information on it except for "vulnerability in the Cookie
parsing module of these SOHO".

Seriously, if you can't disclose the vulnerability yet, please don't spam
with its marketing materials.
Last I checked "full disclosure" was actually about disclosing technical
information and not passing links to marketing sites.

Otherwise, please provide basic information as a technical description of
the vulnerability (which allows reproduction) or a PoC to test whether a
given device is vulnerable.
Please note that you've already given enough information for the attackers
to just find the vulnerability (as in "please reverse engineer the cookie
parsing in this model"), so you're not doing anyone a favor by trying to
play it out like this.
