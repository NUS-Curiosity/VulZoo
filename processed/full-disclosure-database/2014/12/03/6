Subject: [FD] [The ManageOwnage Series,
 part IX]: 0-day arbitrary file download in NetFlow Analyzer and
 IT360

Hi,

This is part 9 of the ManageOwnage series. For previous parts see [1].

Today we have yet another 0 day - an arbitrary file download
vulnerability that be exploited unauthenticated in NetFlow Analyzer
and authenticated in IT360.
I'm releasing this as a 0 day because ManageEngine have been making a
fool out of me for 105 days. I have asked them "are you releasing a
fix soon?" at least a couple of times every month to which they always
responded "yes we will release in the next week/month". And then they
don't release the fix nor provide an explanation. See the advisory
timeline below for details.

An Metasploit auxiliary module that exploits this vulnerability has
been submitted to the Metasploit Framework Github repo in [2].

A full copy of the advisory below can be obtained from my repo in [3].

Regards,
Pedro
