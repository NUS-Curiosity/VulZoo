Subject: [FD] CVE-2014-4973 - Privilege Escalation in ESET Windows Products

Vulnerability title: Privilege Escalation in ESET Windows Products
CVE: CVE-2014-4973
Vendor: ESET
Product: ESET Windows Products
Affected version: v5.0 - 7.0 (Firewall Module Build 1183 (20140214) and

Fixed version: v6 - v7 (Firewall Module Build 1212 (20140609))
Reported by: Kyriakos Economou

Details:

Versions 5.0 - 7.0 of ESET Smart Security and ESET Endpoint Security
products for Windows XP OS allow a low privileged user to execute code
as SYSTEM by exploiting a vulnerability in the ESET Personal Firewall
NDIS filter (EpFwNdis.sys) kernel mode driver also mentioned as Personal
Firewall module Build 1183 (20140214) and prior. This is a 'trusted
value vulnerability' that can be triggered through a specific IOCTL with
a specifically crafted buffer, to force the driver to validate an
improper IOCTL.
