Package        : djvulibre
Vulnerability  : arbitrary code execution
Problem type   : local (remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2012-6535

It was discovered that djvulibre, the Open Source DjVu implementation
project, can be crashed or possibly make it execute arbitrary code when
processing a specially crafted djvu file.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.23-3+squeeze1.

This problem has been fixed before the release of the stable distribution
(wheezy), therefore it is not affected.

We recommend that you upgrade your djvulibre packages.
