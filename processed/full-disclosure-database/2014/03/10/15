         CVE Name        CVE-2014-2288                                        

    Description  A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the     
                 PJSIP channel driver if the "qualify_frequency"              
                 configuration option is enabled on an AOR and the remote     
                 SIP server challenges for authentication of the resulting    
                 OPTIONS request. The response handling code wrongly assumes  
                 that a PJSIP endpoint will always be associated with an      
                 outgoing request which is incorrect.                         

    Resolution  This patch adds a check when handling responses challenging   
                for authentication. If no endpoint is associated with the     
                request no retry with authentication will occur.
