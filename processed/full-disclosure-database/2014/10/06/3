CA20141001-01: Security Notice for Bash Shellshock Vulnerability


Issued: October 01, 2014
Updated: October 03, 2014


CA Technologies is investigating multiple GNU Bash vulnerabilities, 
referred to as the "Shellshock" vulnerabilities, which were publicly 
disclosed on September 24-27, 2014. CVE identifiers CVE-2014-6271, 
CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277, and 
CVE-2014-6278 have been assigned to these vulnerabilities. These 
vulnerabilities could allow a local or remote attacker to utilize 
specially crafted input to execute arbitrary commands or code.

The CA Technologies Enterprise Information Security team has led a 
global effort to identify and remediate systems and products discovered 
with these vulnerabilities. We continue to patch our systems as fixes 
become available, and we are providing fixes for affected CA 
Technologies products.

CA Technologies continues to aggressively scan our environments 
(including servers, networks, external facing applications, and SaaS 
environments) to proactively monitor, identify, and remediate any 
vulnerability when necessary.


Risk Rating

High


Platform

AIX
Android (not vulnerable, unless rooted)
Apple iOS (not vulnerable unless jailbroken)
Linux
Mac OS X
Solaris
Windows (not vulnerable unless Cygwin or similar ported Linux tools 
   with Bash shell are installed)
Other UNIX/BSD based systems if Bash is installed
Any other OS or JeOS that utilizes Bash


Affected Products

The following products have been identified as potentially vulnerable, 
and we have made fixes available for all of these products.

CA API Management (Linux appliance only)

CA Application Performance Management (TIM is the only affected APM 
   component)

CA Application Performance Management Cloud Monitor

CA Customer Experience Manager (CEM) Transaction Impact Monitor (TIM)

CA Layer 7 products (API Gateway, Mobile Access Gateway, API Management 
   Portal)

CA User Activity Reporting Module (Enterprise Log Manager)

Note: This security notice will be updated if other CA Technologies 
products are determined to be vulnerable.

In most cases, the Bash vulnerabilities will need to be patched by OS 
vendors. Exceptions may include CA Technologies appliances, and 
software products that include Linux, UNIX or Mac OS X based operating 
systems (that include Bash).


Affected Components

CentOS
Cygwin
GNU Bash
Red Hat Enterprise Linux
SUSE Linux


Non-Affected Products

IMPORTANT NOTE: This listing includes only a small subset of the 
unaffected CA Technologies products. We're including unaffected 
products that customers have already inquired about. While the 
following CA Technologies products are not directly affected by the 
Bash vulnerabilities, the underlying operating systems that CA 
Technologies software is installed on may be vulnerable. We strongly 
encourage our customers to follow the recommendations provided by their 
vendors for all operating systems they utilize.

All CA SaaS / On Demand products were either not vulnerable or have 
already been patched.

CA AHS / PaymentMinder - AHS App is not vulnerable. The AHS app does 
not execute CGI scripts, or spawn or execute shell commands from within 
the app. AHS infrastructure already patched.

CA Asset Portfolio Management

CA AuthMinder (Arcot WebFort)

CA AuthMinder for Business Users

CA AuthMinder for Consumers

CA AutoSys products - We use the bash shell that comes with the 
operating system and the customer is responsible for patching their OS. 
Additionally, the agents themselves do not distribute any scripts that 
use bash.

CA Clarity On Demand

CA CloudMinder - CloudMinder does not include the Bash Shell in BoM, or 
use it, but because we are deployed on RHEL, customers may be 
indirectly affected. Customers using RHEL should apply patches provided 
by Red Hat.

CA Console Management for OpenVMS - Our OpenVMS products do not bundle 
bash, and they do not supply bash scripts; we use nothing but the 
native DCL CLI.

CA ControlMinder

CA DataMinder (formerly DLP) products – Software and appliance 
confirmed not vulnerable. Note: Linux Agents shipped, but no public SSH 
or Web apps are used in these agents. Customers should patch bash shell 
on any Linux server with DataMinder agents. DataMinder agents should 
continue to function normally.

CA Digital Payments SaaS (previously patched)

CA Directory

CA eCommerce SaaS / On Demand (previously patched)

CA Endevor Software Change Manager

CA Federation (formerly SiteMinder Federation)

CA GovernanceMinder

CA IdentityMinder

CA Infrastructure Management

CA JCLCheck

CA Job Management for OpenVMS - Our OpenVMS products do not bundle 
bash, and they do not supply bash scripts; we use nothing but the 
native DCL CLI.

CA NetQoS GigaStor Observer Expert

CA Network Flow Analysis

CA Performance Management for OpenVMS - Our OpenVMS products do not 
bundle bash, and they do not supply bash scripts; we use nothing but 
the native DCL CLI.

CA RiskMinder

CA Service Desk Manager

CA Service Operations Insight (SOI)

CA SiteMinder

CA SOLVE:Access

CA Spectrum for Linux - Not vulnerable. Be sure to apply bash fixes 
from your underlying operating system vendor.

CA Strong Authentication

CA System Watchdog for OpenVMS - Our OpenVMS products do not bundle 
bash, and they do not supply bash scripts; we use nothing but the 
native DCL CLI.

CA Top Secret

CA Universal Job Management Agent for OpenVMS - Our OpenVMS products do 
not bundle bash, and they do not supply bash scripts; we use nothing 
but the native DCL CLI.

CA Virtual Assurance for Infrastructure Managers (VAIM)


Solution

CA Technologies has issued the following fixes to address the 
vulnerabilities.

CA API Management:
Patches for Linux appliance are available through CA Support to 
customers of Gateway (applicable for all versions – 6.1.5, 6.2, 7.0, 
7.1, 8.0, 8.1, 8.1.1, 8.1.02).

CA Application Performance Management:
KB article for APM TIM has been published. APM TIM is the only part of 
APM that was affected. Refer to TEC618037.

CA Application Performance Management Cloud Monitor:
New images are available for subscribers. Download the latest OPMS 
version 8.2.1.5. For assistance, contact CA Support.

CA Customer Experience Manager (CEM) Transaction Impact Monitor (TIM):
Very low risk. 9.6 is not affected. 9.5 Installation uses Bash. We do 
not use Bash at all for the CEM operating system that we have shipped 
in the past. This means that customers who patch the OS will not impact 
the ability of the CEM TIMsoft from operating. However prior to version 
9.6, the TIM installation script does use the bash shell. See new KB 
article TEC618037 for additional information.

CA Layer 7 (API Gateway, Mobile Access Gateway, API Management Portal):
Fixes for all Bash vulnerabilities and a security bulletin are available 
on the Layer 7 Support website.

CA User Activity Reporting Module (Enterprise Log Manager):
All 12.5 and 12.6 GA versions are potentially affected. Patches 
provided on 2014-09-30. To get the patch, use the OS update 
functionality to get the latest R12.6 SP1 subscription update. Note 
that you can update R12.5 SPx with the R12.6 SP1 OS update. For 
assistance, contact CA Support.


Workaround

None

To help mitigate the risk, we do strongly encourage all customers to 
follow patch management best practices, and in particular for operating 
systems affected by the Bash Shellshock vulnerabilities.
