Subject: Re: [FD] CVE-2014-5308 - Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities in
	TestLink

I am unable to exploit this with any user except admin, so I am curious how
you were able to come to the conclusion that any user who could sign up
would be able to exploit these...

"Note:'Any user can create account for the application in
'testlink/firstLogin.php' page hence its possible to exploit aforementioned
SQL injections without prior knowledge of the authentication details.'"

Even capturing the vulnerable requests with burp and cookie swapping with
my newly-created user (whom is guest by default), I was hit with RBAC.
