Advisory Details:

Newtelligence dasBlog ct.ashx is vulnerable to Open Redirect attacks.


dasBlog supports a feature called Click-Through which basically tracks all
links clicked inside your blog posts. It's a nice feature that allows the
blogger to stay informed what kind of content readers like. If
Click-Through is turned on, all URLs inside blog entries will be replaced
with <URL to your blog>/ct.ashx?id=<Blog entry ID>&url=<URL-encoded
original URL> which of course breaks WebSnapr previews.


Web.config code:
<add verb="*" path="ct.ashx"
type="newtelligence.DasBlog.Web.Services.ClickThroughHandler,
newtelligence.DasBlog.Web.Services"/>


(1) The vulnerability occurs at "ct.ashx?" page, with "&url" parameter.



Solutions:
2014-10-15 Public disclosure with self-written patch.
