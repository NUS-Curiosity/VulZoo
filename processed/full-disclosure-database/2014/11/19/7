Advantech AdamView Buffer Overflow


1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Advantech AdamView Buffer Overflow
Advisory ID: CORE-2014-0008
Advisory URL:
http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/advantech-adamView-buffer-overflow
Date published: 2014-11-19
Date of last update: 2014-11-19
Vendors contacted: Advantech
Release mode: User release


2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Buffer overflow [CWE-119]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2014-8386


3. *Vulnerability Description*

    Advantech AdamView [1] is a HMI Software for Data Acquisition
    software package for human-machine interfaces HMI, and supervisory
    control and data acquisition SCADA.

    Advantech AdamView has to two different fields vulnerable to buffer
    overflow attacks, which can be exploited by attackers in order to
    execute arbitrary code by running files with the '.gni' extension
    that is assosiated with the AdamView software.

   
4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Advantech AdamView V4.3
   . Other versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

    The vendor informed us that the product is no longer supported and
    therefore no fix or update is going to be released.
        
    Given that this is a client-side vulnerability, affected users
    should avoid opening untrusted '.gni' files. Core Security also
    recommends those affected use third party software such as Sentinel
    [3] or EMET [2] that could help to prevent the exploitation of
    affected systems to some extent.

    
6. *Credits*

    This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Daniel Kazimirow
    and Fernando Paez from Core Security Exploit Writers Team. The
    publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquín Rodríguez
    Varela from Core Advisories Team.

  

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

    This vulnerability is caused by a stack buffer overflow when parsing
    the display properties parameter. A malicious third party could
    trigger execution of arbitrary code within the context of the
    application, or otherwise crash the whole application.
        
    Below are shown the vulnerable fields, the debug information, and
    the stack state after being overwritten.
