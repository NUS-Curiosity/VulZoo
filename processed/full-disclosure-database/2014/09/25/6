In what way? It doesn't have a logo, so it's a bit better in my book.

But seriously, yup, it's probably worse - it likely affects more sites

I have written down some technical details about the issue and the
problems with all the patches so far:

Most of the technical discussions seem to be happening on oss-security@.
