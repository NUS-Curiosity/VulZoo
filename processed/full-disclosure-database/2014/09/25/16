i don't have an exhaustive list. my friends at $dayjob told me to use
debian, so i am. i see this:

http://manpages.debian.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=execv&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=Debian+7.0+wheezy&format=html&locale=en

which contains this text:

>        If the header of a  file  isn't  recognized  (the  attempted  execve(2) <http://manpages.debian.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=execve&sektion=2&apropos=0&manpath=Debian+7.0+wheezy&locale=>
>        failed  with the error ENOEXEC), these functions will execute the shell
>        (/bin/sh) with the path of the file as its first  argument.   (If  this
>        attempt fails, no further searching is done.)

i now see that this only applies to execlp() and execvp(), not to the
entire family. (was reading in a terminal window before.)
