Subject: Re: [FD] Critical bash vulnerability CVE-2014-6271

A quick test that was posted somewhere this morning..

Vulnerable or Not?
You can check if you're vulnerable by running the following commands
(code provided by the CSA). Open a terminal window and enter the
following command at the $ prompt:

env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"

If you're vulnerable it'll print:

vulnerable
this is a test

If you've updated Bash you'll only see:

this is a test
