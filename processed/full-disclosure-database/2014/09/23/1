Subject: [FD] [KIS-2014-09] X2Engine <= 4.1.7 (SiteController.php) PHP
 Object Injection Vulnerability

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
X2Engine <= 4.1.7 (SiteController.php) PHP Object Injection Vulnerability
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

http://www.x2engine.com/


[-] Affected Versions:

All versions from 2.8 to 4.1.7.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the "actionSendErrorReport" method defined in /protected/controllers/SiteController.php:

153.	    public function actionSendErrorReport(){
154.	        if(isset($_POST['report'])){
155.	            $errorReport = $_POST['report'];
156.	            $errorReport = unserialize(base64_decode($errorReport));
157.	            if(isset($_POST['email'])){
158.	                $errorReport['email'] = $_POST['email'];
159.	            }

User input passed through the "report" POST parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a call to the "unserialize()"
function at line 156. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope, and could allow an
attacker to carry out Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and possibly other attacks via specially crafted serialized objects.


[-] Solution:

Apply the vendor patch or update to version 4.2 or later.
