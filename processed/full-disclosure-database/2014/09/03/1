Subject: [FD] Uninit memory disclosure via truncated images in Firefox

Yello,

The recent release of Firefox 32 fixes another interesting image
parsing issue found by afl [1]: following a refactoring of memory
management code, the past few versions of the browser ended up using
uninitialized memory for certain types of truncated images, which is
easily measurable with a simple <canvas> + toDataURL() harness that
examines all the fuzzer-generated test cases.

Depending on a variety of factors, problems like that may leak secrets
across web origins, or more prosaically, may help attackers bypass
security measures such as ASLR. Here's a short proof-of-concept that
should work if you haven't updated to 32 yet:

This is tracked as CVE-2014-1564, Mozilla bug 1045977, MFSA 2014-69.
