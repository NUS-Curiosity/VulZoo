it's like this:

> vixie@...ux1:~$ uname -srm
> Linux 3.2.0-4-amd64 x86_64
> vixie@...ux1:~$ head -1 /sbin/dhclient-script
> #!/bin/bash 

i'm told that this is somewhat common, which probably means that not all
shells are good enough for this script. on debian, /bin/sh is "dash"
which may be an example of "not good enough to run this script".

on systems like red hat and mac osx where /bin/sh just is bash, it's the
same effect but dhclient-script begins #!/bin/sh instead.

here's a POC:
