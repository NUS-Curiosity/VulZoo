Sorry - my answer was unclear - you will see the bug in anything that uses
the TLS implementation in OpenSSL. I said https because it seemed like
(maybe I misunderstood) Nik was asking about http. Admittedly I was tired
when I replied; in retrospect I should have waited :)

So if SPDY uses TLS with a vuln version of OpenSSL, yes the problem exists.
