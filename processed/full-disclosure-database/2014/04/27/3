Subject: [FD] Exploit: McAfee ePolicy 0wner (ePowner) – Release

Hello,

ePolicy 0wner is an interesting exploit code which targets multiple
weaknesses and security bugs (CVE-2013-0140 and CVE-2013-0141) in the
McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator software from versions v4.6.0 to 4.6.6.
The tool is able to perform various actions against both the ePO server
"and" the managed stations. The most exciting feature is “Software
deployment” on the managed stations which can be used to upload and
execute anything you like, on any windows boxes managed by the ePO server.
