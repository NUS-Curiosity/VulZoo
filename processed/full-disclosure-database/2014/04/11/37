Uh huh. And here's a fairly unequivocal rebuttal:

There's not a whole lot of wiggle room. It's possible that the
statement is an outright lie, but as much as I never expected to be
saying that, I'm more inclined to side with the NSA than with "unnamed
sources" in online journalism. The latter has gone kind of bonkers
post-Snowden, mixing legitimate (and sometimes very concerning)
revelations with a remarkable amount of drivel.
