and you have to add what is statically linked and keep track of every php/ruby/python/whatever scripts, don't you?

Partly true.

OpenSSH does utilize the libraries of OpenSSL for cryptographic purposes (ldd will reveal the presence of libcrypto.so), but this is for generating and utilizing asymmetric keys. CVE-2014-0160 impacts the heartbeat extension of TLS and since the SSH protocol does not use SSL/TLS, you should be fine.

As a general rule of thumb for this vulnerability, any binary/service dynamically linked to libssl.so should be considered compromised.

SSH does not usually use OpenSSL libraries, so no.
