Subject: Re: [FD] heartbleed.c

I made a mistake and was premature to send that last version to the list as
it had horrendous bugs and wasn't correct at all, this version now
correctly leaks from the server the full 64k heap block. It will also
attempt on client but I encountered some errors (client forcefully closing
connection etc.). It's late and I am sure there are bugs, any future
versions please see
https://github.com/HackerFantastic/Public/blob/master/exploits/heartbleed.cas
I will update it as needed.

Regards,
Matthew
