speaking of ambulance chasers, in the above-referenced article, THIS
little gem:

"On a scale of one to 10, it is an 11," renowned security expert Bruce
Schneier said of the bug.

really bruce? on a scale of doesn't-matter-at-all to
worst-thing-you-could-have-previously-imagined, a read only exploit is
even worse than that? no remote file modification, no root shell, no
non-root shell, no data-modification, no arbitrary file system reads...
just a read only heap exploit, and it's worse than anything you could
have previously fucking imagined?

gentlemen and ladies, we have met the enemy, and they are our egos.
