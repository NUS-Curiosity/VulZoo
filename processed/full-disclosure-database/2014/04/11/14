Subject: [FD] CVE-2014-2384 - Invalid Pointer Dereference in VMware
 Workstation and Player

Vulnerability title: Invalid Pointer Dereference in VMware Workstation
and Player
CVE: CVE-2014-2384
Vendor: VMware
Product: Workstation, Player
Affected version: VMware WorkStation v10.0.1 build-1379776 and VMware
Player v6.0.1 build-1379776
Fixed version: N/A
Reported by: Kyriakos Economou

Details:

The vmx86.sys (32 & 64-bit) kernel mode driver shared by various VMware
Windows products such as VMware Workstation and VMWare Player, allows a
local attacker to kill the host system through a Blue Screen of Death by
sending a specific IOCTL code with a 3 bytes, or larger, input buffer.

The Blue Screen is triggered because the vulnerable function doesnâ€™t
check if a pointer to a memory page is valid or not, thus causing a
memory access violation by trying to read from an unallocated memory page.
