here's an example of some of the data that got returned:

/config/pwtoken_get?src=emailimap&ts=12345&login=foo&passwd=bar&

As you can see, figuring out what strings are wrapped around it is trivial and 
I am assuming that there are people out there who did nothing but trying to
extract this information in an automized way. Cookies too got passed this way.

Change your passwords :)
