How realistic is it that an attacker would be able to glean passwords through 
this vulnerability? Programatically searching through 64k memory dumps for 
certificates seems plausible, but looking for passwords does not. A password is 
of no pre-determined length or format. So unless you know what strings are 
wrapped around it (and those strings are reliably presented), isn't the loss 
of some types of sensitive information.... unlikely?

Cheers.
