HTTP POST requests have a very specific and distinctive format that
makes it very easy to automatically spot web app login attempts if you
happen to stumble upon one. On top of that, the nature of this
vulnerability makes it relatively easy to stumble upon snippets of
requests made by other users (whereas the leak of crypto keys appears
to be considerably less likely under normal circumstances).
