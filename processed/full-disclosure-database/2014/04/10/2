Subject: Re: [FD] heartbleed OpenSSL bug CVE-2014-0160

This code is horrible. 

https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/ssl/t1_lib.c#L2893

/* Determine if we need to see RI. Strictly speaking if we want to
* avoid an attack we should *always* see RI even on initial server
* hello because the client doesn't see any renegotiation during an
* attack. However this would mean we could not connect to any server
* which doesn't support RI so for the immediate future tolerate RI
* absence on initial connect only.
*/

Um, you're kidding me right?

What the actual fuck.
