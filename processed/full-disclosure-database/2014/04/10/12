Passwords could easily be found with servers that would have many
logins, for example mail.yahoo.com.
Here's what a small sample of such a login looked like using one of the
python PoCs that were available:

----------------
}]..Connection:
keep-alive..Cont
ent-Type: applic
ation/x-www-form
-urlencoded..Con
tent-Length: 96.
...username=john
niedoe123%40gmai
l.com&password=s
upersecret123&re
member=remember&
submit_form=Sign
+in..E5.....dJ..
----------------

besides passwords though, one could also get cookies and session data.
