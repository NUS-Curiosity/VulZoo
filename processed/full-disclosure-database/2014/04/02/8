=====================================================================
Description:

During an external penetration test exercise for one of our clients,
 an authentication bypass vulnerability was found in the
 administrative interface of a MobileIron deployment. This ultimately
 allowed us to, gain access to our client's internal network.

The 'j_username' parameter of the script at
https://<target>/mics/j_spring_security_check is vulnerable to blind
 XPath Injection, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve the
 underlying XML document.

This XML document is an excerpt of the configuration file of the
 device. It contains obfuscated passwords and, depending on
 configuration, might contain domain credentials and allow the
 attacker to reposition both internally and on any of the attached
 devices.
 This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2014-1409.

The password obfuscation algorithm is known and has already been
 documented [1]... AES-ECB-PKCS1.5 with a known, shared key. While we
 won't release a full-featured exploit for the vulnerability, we will
 release a PoC to confirm whether the hashes are indeed vulnerable.
 The vendor has confirmed that a stronger encryption method is used
 since release 5.7.
 This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2013-7286.

NB: A second insecure encryption scheme is described in [1], MITRE has
 assigned CVE-2013-7287 to that separate vulnerability.

=====================================================================
Impact

Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to take
 over the device and potentially any device attached to it as well
 as the Active Directory Domain it might be linked to.

=====================================================================
Versions affected:

- - Sentry Standalone < 5
- - VSP < 5.9.1

=====================================================================
Workaround:

Restrict access to the MICS service (administrative interface) to
 specific hosts:
MICS Portal -> Security -> Portal ACLs -> System Manager Portal ACL
