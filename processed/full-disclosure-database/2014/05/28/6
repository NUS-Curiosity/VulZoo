Subject: [FD] [SECURITY] CVE-2014-0096 Apache Tomcat information disclosure

CVE-2014-0096 Information Disclosure

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- Apache Tomcat 8.0.0-RC1 to 8.0.3
- Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.52
- Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.39

Description:
The default servlet allows web applications to define (at multiple
levels) an XSLT to be used to format a directory listing. When running
under a security manager, the processing of these was not subject to the
same constraints as the web application. This enabled a malicious web
application to bypass the file access constraints imposed by the
security manager via the use of external XML entities.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.0.5 or later
  (8.0.4 contains the fix but was not released)
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.53 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 6.0.41 or later
  (6.0.40 contains the fix but was not released)

Credit:
This issue was identified by the Tomcat security team.
