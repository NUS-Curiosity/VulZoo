Subject: [FD] CVE-2014-3445 - Unauthenticated Backup and Password Disclosure
 in HandsomeWeb SOS Webpages

Vulnerability title: Unauthenticated Backup and Password Disclosure in
HandsomeWeb SOS Webpages
CVE: CVE-2014-3445
Vendor: HandsomeWeb
Product: SOS Webpages
Affected version: 1.1.11 and earlier
Fixed version: 1.1.12
Reported by: Freakyclown

Details:

The default setup allows an unauthenticated user to access
administrative functions such as backing up of key files within the CMS.
This is done by appending the following to a domain using the software
affected.

/backup.php?a=2&k=6f15afa1ac4edea0g145e884116334b7

Where "a" is the file number to back up and "k" is the MD5key used to
authenticate the administrator, however if "k" does not match the
correct key rather than disallowing the unauthenticated user to back up
the file the service will provide the user with the correct key. For
example:

Failure, wrong key. The right key is 5f17aca1ae2edea0f145e884116371a5

Using this new key in the url such as below:
/backup.php?a=2&k=5f17aca1ae2edea0f145e884116371a5

Will allow the user to perform the backup of files.

In addition to this the key is generated by the code:
$backupkey=MD5

Making it trivial to decrypt the key provided above to gain the
administrators password and gain further control over the site.
