Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow in Graphviz might lead to user-assisted execution of
arbitrary code via a DOT file.

Background
==========

Graphviz is an open source graph visualization software.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-gfx/graphviz      < 2.20.3                        >= 2.20.3

Description
===========

Roee Hay reported a stack-based buffer overflow in the push_subg()
function in parser.y when processing a DOT file with a large number of
Agraph_t elements.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted DOT file in an application using Graphviz, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Graphviz users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/graphviz-2.20.3"

==========
