Description:
    Previous versions of the initscripts package are vulnerable to a Denial
    of Service attack in which a local user may cause arbitrary files to
    be deleted at next boot time by creating symlinks under various /var
    subdirectories.
    
    A future release of rPath Appliance Platform Agent (rAPA)
    will contain a text-mode console that allows initial network
    configuration to be done from the text console when an appliance
    cannot be initially configured via DHCP.  The initscripts package
    has been enhanced to support this text-mode console functionality.
    If the /sbin/rapa-console program (which will be available as part of
    the rapa-console package) is installed on the system, then it will be
    run on virtual console 1 instead of a standard shell login session.
    The login information used for this text-mode console is the rAPA
    user login information, not system user login information.
