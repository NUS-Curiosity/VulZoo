Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 11.04.08: Adobe Reader
 Embedded Font Handling Out of Bounds Array Indexing Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 11.04.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Nov 04, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Acrobat Reader is a program for viewing Portable Document Format
(PDF) documents. More information is available at the following site:

http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an out of bounds array access vulnerability in
Adobe System Inc.'s Adobe Reader could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code as the current user.

The vulnerability specifically exists in code responsible for parsing
Type 1 fonts. After allocating an area of memory, no bounds checking is
performed. Subsequent access of this memory may result in modification
of arbitrary memory, which in turn may result in arbitrary code
execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code as the current user. In order to exploit this
vulnerability, the attacker would have to convince the target user to
open a maliciously crafted file, either by opening an email attachment
or visiting a website which contained an embedded PDF file. No further
interaction is required. The Explorer extension which displays the
thumbnail view of the document, AcroRd32Info, is also vulnerable. This
may allow the vulnerability to be exploited by simply clicking on a PDF
file without opening it, even from a network share.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Adobe
Reader version 8.1.1. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workarounds for this
issue.

Configuring the application not to open in the browser may mitigate
exposure to some web-based attacks.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Adobe has released a patch which addresses this issue. For more
