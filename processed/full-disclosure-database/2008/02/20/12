-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Symantec VERITAS Storage Foundation.
Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw resides in the Administrator service, vxsvc.exe,
which listens by default on UDP port 3207. The process trusts a
user-supplied size value, receiving the specified amount of data into a
static heap buffer. By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker
can overflow that buffer leading to arbitrary code execution in the
context of the SYSTEM user.


-- Vendor Response:
Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
