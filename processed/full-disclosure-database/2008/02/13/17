SCCP and SIP-Related Vulnerabilities

  * DNS Response Parsing Overflow

    Cisco Unified IP Phone 7940, 7940G, 7960 and 7960G devices
    running SCCP and SIP firmware contain a buffer overflow
    vulnerability in the handling of DNS responses. A
    specially-crafted DNS response may be able to trigger a buffer
    overflow and execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable phone. This
    vulnerability is corrected in SCCP firmware version 8.0(8) and
    SIP firmware version 8.8(0). This vulnerability is documented in 
    CVE-2008-0530 leavingcisco.com and Cisco Bug IDs CSCsj74818 and
    CSCsk21863.

SCCP-Only Related Vulnerabilities

  * Large ICMP Echo Request DoS

    Cisco Unified IP Phone 7940, 7940G, 7960 and 7960G devices
    running SCCP firmware contain a DoS vulnerability. It is possible
    to cause a vulnerable device to reboot by sending a large ICMP
    echo request packet. This vulnerability is corrected in SCCP
    firmware version 8.0(6). This vulnerability is documented in 
    CVE-2008-0526 leavingcisco.com and Cisco Bug ID CSCsh71110.

  * HTTP Server DoS

    Cisco Unified IP Phone 7935 and 7936 devices running SCCP
    firmware contain a DoS vulnerability in their internal HTTP
    server. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to TCP port
    80 on a vulnerable phone, it may be possible to cause the phone
    to reboot. It is possible to workaround this issue by disabling
    the internal HTTP server on vulnerable phones. The internal HTTP
    server only listens to TCP port 80. This vulnerability is
    corrected in SCCP firmware version 3.2(17) for 7935 devices and
    SCCP firmware version 3.3(15) for 7936 devices. This
    vulnerability is documented in CVE-2008-0527 leavingcisco.com and
    Cisco Bug ID CSCsk20026.

  * SSH Server DoS

    Cisco Unified IP Phone 7906G, 7911G, 7941G, 7961G, 7970G and
    7971G devices running SCCP firmware contain a buffer overflow
    vulnerability in their internal Secure Shell (SSH) server. By
    sending a specially crafted to packet to TCP port 22 on a
    vulnerable phone, it may be possible for an unauthenticated
    attacker to cause the phone to reboot. It may also be possible
    for an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with
    system privileges. It is possible to workaround this issue by
    disabling the internal SSH server on vulnerable phones. The
    internal SSH server only listens to TCP port 22. This
    vulnerability is corrected in SCCP firmware version 8.2(2)SR2.
    This vulnerability is documented in CVE-2004-2486 
    leavingcisco.com and Cisco Bug ID CSCsh79629.

SIP-Only Related Vulnerabilities

  * SIP MIME Boundary Overflow

    Cisco Unified IP Phone 7940, 7940G, 7960 and 7960G devices
    running SIP firmware contain a buffer overflow vulnerability in
    the handling of Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
    encoded data. By sending a specially crafted SIP message to a
    vulnerable phone, it may be possible to trigger a buffer overflow
    and execute arbitrary code on the phone. This vulnerability is
    corrected in SIP firmware version 8.8(0). This vulnerability is
    documented in CVE-2008-0528 leavingcisco.com and Cisco Bug ID
    CSCsj74786.

  * Telnet Server Overflow

    Cisco Unified IP Phone 7940, 7940G, 7960 and 7960G devices
    running SIP firmware contain a buffer overflow vulnerability in
    their internal telnet server. The telnet server is disabled by
    default and can be configured to allow either privileged or
    unprivileged user-level access. If the telnet server is enabled
    for privileged or unprivileged access, the phone password
    parameter must additionally be configured to permit telnet
    access. By entering a specially crafted command on a phone
    configured to permit unprivileged access, it may be possible for
    an unprivileged-level, authenticated user to trigger a buffer
    overflow and obtain privileged-level access to the phone. It is
    possible to workaround this issue by disabling the internal
    telnet server on vulnerable phones. This vulnerability is
    corrected in SIP firmware version 8.8(0). This vulnerability is
    documented in CVE-2008-0529 leavingcisco.com and Cisco Bug ID
    CSCsj78359.

  * SIP Proxy Response Overflow

    Cisco Unified IP Phone 7940, 7940G, 7960 and 7960G devices
    running SIP firmware contain a heap overflow vulnerability in the
    handling of a challenge/response message from a SIP proxy. If an
    attacker controls the SIP proxy to which a vulnerable phone is
    registered, attempts to register, or the attacker can act as a
    man-in-the-middle, it may be possible to send a malicious
    challenge/response message to a phone and execute arbitrary code.
    This vulnerability is corrected in SIP firmware version 8.8(0).
    This vulnerability is documented in CVE-2008-0531 
    leavingcisco.com and Cisco Bug ID CSCsj74765.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause vulnerable
IP phone devices to reboot which will interrupt client voice services
and, in some cases, allow the execution of arbitrary code.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt and any subsequent advisories to
determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center ("TAC") or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

Workarounds are available for several of the vulnerabilities.
Disabling unnecessary internal phone Telnet and HTTP servers will
eliminate exposure to the Telnet Server overflow and HTTP Server DoS
vulnerabilities.

It is possible to mitigate these vulnerabilities with access control
lists (ACL). Filters that deny ICMP Echo Request, TCP port 22 (SSH),
TCP port 23 (Telnet), TCP port 80 (HTTP), TCP/UDP port 53 (DNS) and
TCP/UDP port 5060 (SIP) should be deployed at voice/data network
boundaries as part of a tACL policy for protection of traffic which
enters the network at ingress access points. This policy should be
configured to protect the network device and other devices behind it
where the filter is applied.

Additional information about tACLs is available in "Transit Access
Control Lists: Filtering at Your Edge":

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20080116-phone.shtml

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco will make free software available to address this vulnerability
for affected customers. This advisory will be updated as fixed
software becomes available. Prior to deploying software, customers
should consult their maintenance provider or check the software for
feature set compatibility and known issues specific to their
environment.
