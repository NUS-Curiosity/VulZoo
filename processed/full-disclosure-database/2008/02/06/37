Synopsis
========

Two boundary errors have been identified in SDL_image allowing for the
remote execution of arbitrary code or the crash of the application
using the library.

Background
==========

SDL_image is an image file library that loads images as SDL surfaces,
and supports various formats like BMP, GIF, JPEG, LBM, PCX, PNG, PNM,
TGA, TIFF, XCF, XPM, and XV.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-libs/sdl-image     < 1.2.6-r1                   >= 1.2.6-r1

Description
===========

The LWZReadByte() function in file IMG_gif.c and the IMG_LoadLBM_RW()
function in file IMG_lbm.c each contain a boundary error that can be
triggered to cause a static buffer overflow and a heap-based buffer
overflow. The first boundary error comes from some old vulnerable GD
PHP code (CVE-2006-4484).

Impact
======

A remote attacker can make an application using the SDL_image library
to process a specially crafted GIF file or IFF ILBM file that will
trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code
with the permissions of the application or the application crash.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All SDL_image users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/sdl-image-1.2.6-r1"
