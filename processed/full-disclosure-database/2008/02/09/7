Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 02.08.08: Adobe Reader
 and Acrobat JavaScript Insecure Method Exposure Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 02.08.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Feb 08, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Adobe Reader is a program for viewing Portable Document Format (PDF)
documents. Acrobat is the program used to create such documents. More
information is available at the following URLs.

http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/
http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an insecure method exposed by the JavaScript
library in Adobe Reader and Acrobat could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code as the current user.

Adobe Reader and Acrobat implement a version of JavaScript in the
EScript.api plug-in which is based on the reference implementation used
in Mozilla products. One of the methods exposed allows direct control
over low level features of the object, which in turn allows execution
of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code as the current user. In order to exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker would have to convince the targeted user to
open a maliciously constructed file. This file could be sent directly
to the targeted user or linked from a website.

Insufficient error checking is performed on the input which allows,
among other things, attacker-supplied data to be written to arbitrary
offsets in memory, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability exists in Adobe Reader 8.1 on
Windows XP SP2. It is likely that other Adobe products that handle PDF
files, including previous versions of Adobe Reader, are also affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Disabling JavaScript in Adobe Reader or Acrobat will limit exposure to
this vulnerability. When JavaScript is disabled, Adobe Reader will
prompt the user that some components of the document may not function,
and provide an opportunity to enable it.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Adobe released version 8.1.2 of Adobe Reader and Acrobat to address this
vulnerability. Although there is currently no update for version 7.0.9,
Adobe reports it does plan to release one at a later date. For more
information, visit the vendor's advisory at the following URL.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2007-5663 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
security problems.
