Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk.

Background
==========

Asterisk is an open source telephony engine and tool kit.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /    Vulnerable    /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-misc/asterisk      < 1.2.21.1-r1                *>= 1.2.17-r1
                                                        >= 1.2.21.1-r1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Asterisk:

* Russel Bryant reported a stack buffer overflow in the IAX2 channel
  driver (chan_iax2) when bridging calls between chan_iax2 and any
  channel driver that uses RTP for media (CVE-2007-3762).

* Chris Clark and Zane Lackey (iSEC Partners) reported a NULL pointer
  dereference in the IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) (CVE-2007-3763).

* Will Drewry (Google Security) reported a vulnerability in the
  Skinny channel driver (chan_skinny), resulting in an overly large
  memcpy (CVE-2007-3764).

* Will Drewry (Google Security) reported a vulnerability in the IAX2
  channel driver (chan_iax2), that does not correctly handle
  unauthenticated transactions using a 3-way handshake (CVE-2007-4103).

Impact
======

By sending a long voice or video RTP frame, a remote attacker could
possibly execute arbitrary code on the target machine. Sending
specially crafted LAGRQ or LAGRP frames containing information elements
of IAX frames, or a certain data length value in a crafted packet, or
performing a flood of calls not completing a 3-way handshake, could
result in a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Asterisk users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/asterisk-1.2.17-r1"
