Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution
of arbitrary code and Denial of Service.

Background
==========

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/vlc      < 0.8.6e                           >= 0.8.6e

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Michal Luczaj and Luigi Auriemma reported that VLC contains
  boundary errors when handling subtitles in the ParseMicroDvd(),
  ParseSSA(), and ParseVplayer() functions in the
  modules/demux/subtitle.c file, allowing for a stack-based buffer
  overflow (CVE-2007-6681).

* The web interface listening on port 8080/tcp contains a format
  string error in the httpd_FileCallBack() function in the
  network/httpd.c file (CVE-2007-6682).

* The browser plugin possibly contains an argument injection
  vulnerability (CVE-2007-6683).

* The RSTP module triggers a NULL pointer dereference when processing
  a request without a "Transport" parameter (CVE-2007-6684).

* Luigi Auriemma and Remi Denis-Courmont found a boundary error in
  the modules/access/rtsp/real_sdpplin.c file when processing SDP data
  for RTSP sessions (CVE-2008-0295) and a vulnerability in the
  libaccess_realrtsp plugin (CVE-2008-0296), possibly resulting in a
  heap-based buffer overflow.

* Felipe Manzano and Anibal Sacco (Core Security Technologies)
  discovered an arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerability in VLC's
  MPEG-4 file format parser (CVE-2008-0984).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a long subtitle in a file that a user is
enticed to open, a specially crafted MP4 input file, long SDP data, or
a specially crafted HTTP request with a "Connection" header value
containing format specifiers, possibly resulting in the remote
execution of arbitrary code. Also, a Denial of Service could be caused
and arbitrary files could be overwritten via the "demuxdump-file"
option in a filename in a playlist or via an EXTVLCOPT statement in an
MP3 file.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6e"
