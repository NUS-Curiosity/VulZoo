Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in MPlayer, possibly
allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

MPlayer is a media player incuding support for a wide range of audio
and video formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/mplayer     < 1.0_rc2_p25993        >= 1.0_rc2_p25993

Description
===========

The following errors have been discovered in MPlayer:

* Felipe Manzano and Anibal Sacco (Core Security Technologies)
  reported an array indexing error in the file libmpdemux/demux_mov.c
  when parsing MOV file headers (CVE-2008-0485).

* Damian Frizza and Alfredo Ortega (Core Security Technologies)
  reported a boundary error in the file libmpdemux/demux_audio.c when
  parsing FLAC comments (CVE-2008-0486).

* Adam Bozanich (Mu Security) reported boundary errors in the
  cddb_parse_matches_list() and cddb_query_parse() functions in the
  file stream_cddb.c when parsing CDDB album titles (CVE-2008-0629) and
  in the url_scape_string() function in the file stream/url.c when
  parsing URLS (CVE-2008-0630).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running MPlayer.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_rc2_p25993"
