Synopsis
========

A SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in phpMyAdmin.

Background
==========

phpMyAdmin is a free web-based database administration tool.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-db/phpmyadmin      < 2.11.5                         >= 2.11.5

Description
===========

Richard Cunningham reported that phpMyAdmin uses the $_REQUEST variable
of $_GET and $_POST as a source for its parameters.

Impact
======

An attacker could entice a user to visit a malicious web application
that sets an "sql_query" cookie and is hosted on the same domain as
phpMyAdmin, and thereby conduct SQL injection attacks with the
privileges of the user authenticating in phpMyAdmin afterwards.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All phpMyAdmin users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-db/phpmyadmin-2.11.5"

==========
