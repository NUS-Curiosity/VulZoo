Package        : moin
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2007-2423 CVE-2007-2637 CVE-2008-0780 CVE-2008-0781 CVE-2008-0782 CVE-2008-1098 CVE-2008-1099

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in MoinMoin, a
Python clone of WikiWiki. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2007-2423

    A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
    attachment handling.

CVE-2007-2637

    Access control lists for calendars and includes were
    insufficiently enforced, which could lead to information
    disclosure.

CVE-2008-0780

    A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
    the login code.

CVE-2008-0781

    A cross-site-scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
    attachment handling.

CVE-2008-0782

    A directory traversal vulnerability in cookie handling could
    lead to local denial of service by overwriting files.

CVE-2008-1098

    Cross-site-scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
    the GUI editor formatter and the code to delete pages.

CVE-2008-1099

    The macro code validates access control lists insufficiently,
    which could lead to information disclosure.


For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.3-1.2etch1. This update also includes a bugfix wrt the
encoding of password reminder mails, which doesn't have security
implications.

The old stable distribution (sarge) will not be updated due to
the many changes and support for Sarge ending end of this month
anyway. You're advised to upgrade to the stable distribution if
you run moinmoin.

We recommend that you upgrade your moin package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you

        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
