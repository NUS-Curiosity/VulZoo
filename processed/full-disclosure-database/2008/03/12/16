______________________________________________________________________________


1. Problem Description

        sshd in OpenSSH versions before 4.4, when using the version 1 SSH 
        protocol, could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service 
        (CPU consumption) via an SSH packet that contains duplicate blocks,
        which is not properly handled by the CRC compensation attack detector.
