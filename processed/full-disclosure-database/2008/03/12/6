-- CVE ID:
CVE-2008-1188

Sun Microsystems Java Runtime

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Sun Java Web Start. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page.

The specific flaw exists in the useEncodingDecl() function used while
parsing the xml header character encoding attribute. When a user
downloads a malicious JNLP file, the charset value is read into a static
buffer. If an overly charset name in the xml header is included, a stack
based buffer overflow occurs, resulting in an exploitable condition.

-- Vendor Response:
Sun Microsystems has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
