Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in Roundup allows for bypassing permission
restrictions.

Background
==========

Roundup is an issue-tracking system with command-line, web and e-mail
interfaces.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/roundup     < 1.4.4-r1                       >= 1.4.4-r1

Description
===========

Philipp Gortan reported that the xml-rpc server in Roundup does not
check property permissions (CVE-2008-1475). Furthermore, Roland Meister
discovered multiple vulnerabilities caused by unspecified errors, some
of which may be related to cross-site scripting (CVE-2008-1474).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could possibly exploit the first vulnerability to
edit or view restricted properties via the list(), display(), and set()
methods. The impact and attack vectors of the second vulnerability are
unknown.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Roundup users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/roundup-1.4.4-r1"
