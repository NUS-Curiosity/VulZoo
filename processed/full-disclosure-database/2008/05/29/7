Synopsis
========

An integer overflow vulnerability in MPlayer may allow for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

MPlayer is a media player including support for a wide range of audio
and video formats.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /     Vulnerable     /            Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/mplayer     < 1.0_rc2_p26753        >= 1.0_rc2_p26753

Description
===========

k`sOSe reported an integer overflow vulnerability in the
sdpplin_parse() function in the file stream/realrtsp/sdpplin.c, which
can be exploited to overwrite arbitrary memory regions via an overly
large "StreamCount" SDP parameter.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media
file, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running MPlayer.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All MPlayer users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
">=media-video/mplayer-1.0_rc2_p26753"
