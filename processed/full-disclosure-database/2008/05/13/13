Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the Common Data
Format library.

Background
==========

The Common Data Format library is a scientific data management package
which allows programmers and application developers to manage and
manipulate scalar, vector, and multi-dimensional data arrays in a
platform independent fashion.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sci-libs/cdf       < 3.2.1                               >= 3.2.1

Description
===========

Alfredo Ortega (Core Security Technologies) reported a boundary error
within the Read32s_64() function when processing CDF files.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted CDF
file, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Common Data Format library users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sci-libs/cdf-3.2.1"

References
==========

  [ 1 ] CVE-2008-2080
