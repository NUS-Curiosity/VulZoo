Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in eGroupWare may lead to execution of
arbitrary PHP code, the ability to upload malicious files and
cross-site scripting attacks.

Background
==========

eGroupWare is a suite of web-based group applications including
calendar, address book, messenger and email.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-apps/egroupware      < 1.4.004                     >= 1.4.004

Description
===========

A vulnerability has been reported in FCKEditor due to the way that file
uploads are handled in the file
editor/filemanager/upload/php/upload.php when a filename has multiple
file extensions (CVE-2008-2041). Another vulnerability exists in the
_bad_protocol_once() function in the file
phpgwapi/inc/class.kses.inc.php, which allows remote attackers to
bypass HTML filtering (CVE-2008-1502).

Impact
======

The first vulnerability can be exploited to upload malicious files and
execute arbitrary PHP code provided that a directory is writable by the
webserver. The second vulnerability can be exploited by remote
attackers via a specially crafted URL in order to conduct cross-site
scripting attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All eGroupWare users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/egroupware-1.4.004"
