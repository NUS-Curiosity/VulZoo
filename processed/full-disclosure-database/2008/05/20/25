Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox,
Thunderbird, SeaMonkey and XULRunner, some of which may allow
user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird
an open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The
SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver production-quality
releases of code derived from the application formerly known as the
'Mozilla Application Suite'. XULRunner is a Mozilla runtime package
that can be used to bootstrap XUL+XPCOM applications like Firefox and
Thunderbird.

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were reported in all mentioned Mozilla
products:

* Jesse Ruderman, Kai Engert, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren, and
  Paul Nickerson reported browser crashes related to JavaScript
  methods, possibly triggering memory corruption (CVE-2008-0412).

* Carsten Book, Wesley Garland, Igor Bukanov, moz_bug_r_a4, shutdown,
  Philip Taylor, and tgirmann reported crashes in the JavaScript
  engine, possibly triggering memory corruption (CVE-2008-0413).

* David Bloom discovered a vulnerability in the way images are
  treated by the browser when a user leaves a page, possibly triggering
  memory corruption (CVE-2008-0419).

* moz_bug_r_a4, Boris Zbarsky, and Johnny Stenback reported a series
  of privilege escalation vulnerabilities related to JavaScript
  (CVE-2008-1233, CVE-2008-1234, CVE-2008-1235).

* Mozilla developers identified browser crashes caused by the layout
  and JavaScript engines, possibly triggering memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-1236, CVE-2008-1237).

* moz_bug_r_a4 and Boris Zbarsky discovered that pages could escape
  from its sandboxed context and run with chrome privileges, and inject
  script content into another site, violating the browser's same origin
  policy (CVE-2008-0415).

* Gerry Eisenhaur discovered a directory traversal vulnerability when
  using "flat" addons (CVE-2008-0418).

* Alexey Proskuryakov, Yosuke Hasegawa and Simon Montagu reported
  multiple character handling flaws related to the backspace character,
  the "0x80" character, involving zero-length non-ASCII sequences in
  multiple character sets, that could facilitate Cross-Site Scripting
  attacks (CVE-2008-0416).

The following vulnerability was reported in Thunderbird and SeaMonkey:

* regenrecht (via iDefense) reported a heap-based buffer overflow
  when rendering an email message with an external MIME body
  (CVE-2008-0304).

The following vulnerabilities were reported in Firefox, SeaMonkey and
XULRunner:

* The fix for CVE-2008-1237 in Firefox 2.0.0.13 and SeaMonkey 1.1.9
  introduced a new crash vulnerability (CVE-2008-1380).

* hong and Gregory Fleischer each reported a variant on earlier
  reported bugs regarding focus shifting in file input controls
  (CVE-2008-0414).

* Gynvael Coldwind (Vexillium) discovered that BMP images could be
  used to reveal uninitialized memory, and that this data could be
  extracted using a "canvas" feature (CVE-2008-0420).

* Chris Thomas reported that background tabs could create a
  borderless XUL pop-up in front of pages in other tabs
  (CVE-2008-1241).

* oo.rio.oo discovered that a plain text file with a
  "Content-Disposition: attachment" prevents Firefox from rendering
  future plain text files within the browser (CVE-2008-0592).

* Martin Straka reported that the ".href" property of stylesheet DOM
  nodes is modified to the final URI of a 302 redirect, bypassing the
  same origin policy (CVE-2008-0593).

* Gregory Fleischer discovered that under certain circumstances,
  leading characters from the hostname part of the "Referer:" HTTP
  header are removed (CVE-2008-1238).

* Peter Brodersen and Alexander Klink reported that the browser
  automatically selected and sent a client certificate when SSL Client
  Authentication is requested by a server (CVE-2007-4879).

* Gregory Fleischer reported that web content fetched via the "jar:"
  protocol was not subject to network access restrictions
  (CVE-2008-1240).

The following vulnerabilities were reported in Firefox:

* Justin Dolske discovered a CRLF injection vulnerability when
  storing passwords (CVE-2008-0417).

* Michal Zalewski discovered that Firefox does not properly manage a
  delay timer used in confirmation dialogs (CVE-2008-0591).

* Emil Ljungdahl and Lars-Olof Moilanen discovered that a web forgery
  warning dialog is not displayed if the entire contents of a web page
  are in a DIV tag that uses absolute positioning (CVE-2008-0594).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It
is also possible for an attacker to trick a user to upload arbitrary
files when submitting a form, to corrupt saved passwords for other
sites, to steal login credentials, or to conduct Cross-Site Scripting
and Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask -1 -v ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.14"

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask -1 -v ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.14"

All Mozilla Thunderbird users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask -1 -v ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.14"

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge -a -1 -v ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-2.0.0.14"

All SeaMonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask -1 -v ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.9-r1"

All SeaMonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask -1 -v ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.9"

All XULRunner users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/xulrunner-1.8.1.14"

NOTE: The crash vulnerability (CVE-2008-1380) is currently unfixed in
the SeaMonkey binary ebuild, as no precompiled packages have been
released. Until an update is available, we recommend all SeaMonkey
users to disable JavaScript, use Firefox for JavaScript-enabled
browsing, or switch to the SeaMonkey source ebuild.
