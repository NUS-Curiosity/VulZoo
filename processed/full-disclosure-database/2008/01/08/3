3. Problem description:

 I   OpenPegasus PAM Authentication Buffer Overflow

   Alexander Sotirov from VMware Security Research discovered a
   buffer overflow vulnerability in the OpenPegasus Management server.
   This flaw could be exploited by a malicious remote user on the
   service console network to gain root access to the service console.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
   has assigned the name CVE-2007-5360 to this issue.

   RPM Updated: pegasus-2.5-552927
   VM Shutdown: No
   Host Reboot: No

   Note: ESX Server 3.5 and ESX Server 3i are not affected by this
         issue.

   ESX Server 3.0.2

   md5sum: d19115e965d486e72100ce489efea707

   http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1003176

   ESX Server 2.5.x

   Users should remove the OpenPegasus CIM Management rpm.  This
   component is disabled by default, and VMware recommends that you
   do not use this component of ESX Server 2.x.  If you want to
   use the CIM functionality, upgrade to ESX Server 3.0.1 or a later
   release.

   Note: This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the
         attacker has access to the service console network.

         Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
         service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
         http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726 for more
         information on VMware security best practices.


 II  Service Console package security updates

   a.   Updated Samba package

        An issue where attackers on the service console management
        network can cause a stack-based buffer overflow in the
        reply_netbios_packet function of nmbd in Samba. On systems
        where Samba is being used as a WINS server, exploiting this
        vulnerability can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
        code via crafted WINS Name Registration requests followed by a
        WINS Name Query request.

        An issue where attackers on the service console management
        network can exploit a vulnerability that occurs when Samba is
        configured as a Primary or Backup Domain controller. The
        vulnerability allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact
        via crafted GETDC mailslot requests, related to handling of
        GETDC logon server requests.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the names CVE-2007-5398 and CVE-2007-4572 to these
        issues.

  Note: By default Samba is not configured as a WINS server or a domain
        controller and ESX is not vulnerable unless the administrator
        has changed the default configuration.

        This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the
        attacker has access to the service console network.

        Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
        service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
        http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726 for more
        information on VMware security best practices.

        RPM Updated:
        samba-3.0.9-1.3E.14.1vmw
        samba-client-3.0.9-1.3E.14.1vmw
        samba-common-3.0.9-1.3E.14.1vmw

        VM Shutdown: Yes
        Host Reboot: Yes

        ESX Server 2.5.4 download Upgrade Patch 14

   b.   Updated util-linux package

        The patch addresses an issue where the mount and umount
        utilities in util-linux call the setuid and setgid functions in
        the wrong order and do not check the return values, which could
        allow attackers to gain elevated privileges via helper
        application such as mount.nfs.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CVE-2007-5191 to this issue.

        RPM Updated:
        util-linux-2.11y-31.24vmw
        losetup-2.11y-31.24vmw

        http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1002972


   c.   Updated Perl package

        The update addresses an issue where the regular expression
        engine in Perl can be used to issue a specially crafted regular
        expression that allows the attacker to run arbitrary code with
        the permissions level of the current Perl user.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CVE-2007-5116 to this issue.

        RPM Updated:
        perl-5.8.0-97.EL3

        VM Shutdown: Yes
        Host Reboot: Yes

        http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1002964


   d.   Updated OpenSSL package

        A flaw in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers() function can allow an
        attacker to cause a buffer overflow problem by sending ciphers

        to applications that use the function.

        A possible vulnerability that would allow a local attacker to
        obtain private RSA keys being used on a system using the OpenSSL
        package.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the names CVE-2007-3108, and CVE-2007-5135 to these
        issues.

        RPM Updated:
