   Updated VirtualCenter fixes the following application vulnerabilities

   Tomcat Server Security Update
   This release of VirtualCenter Server updates the Tomcat Server
   package from 5.5.17 to 5.5.25, which addresses multiple security
   issues that existed in the earlier releases of Tomcat Server.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
   assigned the names CVE-2005-2090, CVE-2006-7195, and CVE-2007-0450 to
   these issues.

   JRE Security Update
   This release of VirtualCenter Server updates the JRE package from
   1.5.0_7 to 1.5.0_12, which addresses a security issue that existed in
   the earlier release of JRE.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
   assigned the name CVE-2007-3004 to this issue.

   NOTE: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the
         attacker has access to the service console network.

         Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
         service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
         http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726 for more
         information on VMware security best practices.
