Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in libcdio.

Background
==========

libcdio is a library for accessing CD-ROM and CD images.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/libcdio      < 0.78.2-r4                    >= 0.78.2-r4

Description
===========

Devon Miller reported a boundary error in the "print_iso9660_recurse()"
function in files cd-info.c and iso-info.c when processing long
filenames within Joliet images.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted ISO
image in the cd-info and iso-info applications, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. Applications linking against shared libraries of libcdio
are not affected.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libcdio users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libcdio-0.78.2-r4"

References
==========
