Synopsis
========

MaraDNS is prone to a Denial of Service vulnerability impacting CNAME
resolution.

Background
==========

MaraDNS is a package that implements the Domain Name Service (DNS) with
resolver and caching ability.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-dns/maradns      < 1.2.12.08                     >= 1.2.12.08

Description
===========

Michael Krieger reported that a specially crafted DNS could prevent an
authoritative canonical name (CNAME) record from being resolved because
of an "improper rotation of resource records".

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted DNS packets to a
vulnerable server, making it unable to resolve CNAME records.

Workaround
==========

Add "max_ar_chain = 2" to the "marac" configuration file.

Resolution
==========

All MaraDNS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/maradns-1.2.12.09"

References
==========
