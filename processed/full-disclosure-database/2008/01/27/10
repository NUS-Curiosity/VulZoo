Synopsis
========

Blam doesn't properly handle environment variables, potentially
allowing a local attacker to execute arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Blam is an RSS and Atom feed reader for GNOME written in C#.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /  Vulnerable  /                        Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-news/blam       < 1.8.4                              >= 1.8.4

Description
===========

The "/usr/bin/blam" script sets the "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" environment
variable incorrectly, which might result in the current working
directory (.) being included when searching for dynamically linked
libraries of the Mono Runtime application.

Impact
======

A local attacker could entice a user to run Blam in a directory
containing a specially crafted library file which could result in the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Blam.

Workaround
==========

Do not run Blam from an untrusted working directory.

Resolution
==========

All Blam users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-news/blam-1.8.4"
