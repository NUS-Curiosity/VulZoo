Synopsis
========

CherryPy is vulnerable to a directory traversal that could allow
attackers to read and write arbitrary files.

Background
==========

CherryPy is a Python-based, object-oriented web development framework.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-python/cherrypy     < 3.0.2-r1                   *>= 2.2.1-r2
                                                           >= 3.0.2-r1

Description
===========

CherryPy does not sanitize the session id, provided as a cookie value,
in the FileSession._get_file_path() function before using it as part of
the file name.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read and possibly
write arbitrary files on the web server, or to hijack valid sessions,
by providing a specially crafted session id. This only affects
applications using file-based sessions.

Workaround
==========

Disable the "FileSession" functionality by using "PostgresqlSession" or
"RamSession" session management in your CherryPy application.

Resolution
==========

All CherryPy 2.2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-python/cherrypy-2.2.1-r2"

All CherryPy 3.0 users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-python/cherrypy-3.0.2-r1"
