Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 01.15.08: TIBCO
 SmartSockets RTserver Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.15.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jan 15, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

TIBCO SmartSockets is a message passing framework used to transport
messages over disparate channels. The RTserver is the server component
of the framework. More information can be found on the vendor's web
site at the following URL.

http://www.tibco.com/software/messaging/smartsockets/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap overflow vulnerability in TIBCO Software
Inc.'s SmartSockets RTserver may allow an attacker to crash the service
or execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

A heap overflow vulnerability exists within the code responsible for
processing requests. Two distinct values from the request are used for
the allocation size and the amount of data copied. Since both values
are attacker controlled, this can lead to a heap overflow, potentially
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM
privileges. Unsuccessful attempts will likely crash the RTserver. The
service does not restart, which makes repeated exploitation attempts
more difficult.

The RTserver is the core component of the SmartSockets framework.
Without it, applications will be unable to pass messages.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in TIBCO
SmartSockets version 6.8.0. Previous versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workarounds for this issue.
