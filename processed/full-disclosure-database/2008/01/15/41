 QuickTime Macintosh Resource Processing Heap Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 01.15.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jan 15, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Quicktime is Apple's media player product, and is used to render video
and other media. For more information visit the vendor's web site at
the following URL.

http://www.apple.com/quicktime/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap corruption vulnerability in Apple Computer
Inc.'s QuickTime media player could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
code in the context of the targeted user.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the handling of Macintosh
Resources embedded in QuickTime movies. When processing these records,
a length value stored in the resource header is not properly validated.
When a length value larger than the actual buffer size is supplied,
potentially exploitable memory corruption occurs.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary
code in the context of the targeted user. In order to exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker must persuade a user into using QuickTime to
open a specially crafted QuickTime movie file.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense Labs confirmed this vulnerability exists in QuickTime Player
version 7.3.1. Previous versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
