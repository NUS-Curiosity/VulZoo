iDefense Security Advisory 10.29.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 29, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

The WebLogic Apache Connector is module for the Apache httpd server. It
is used to proxy requests from Apache to a backend WebLogic server. For
more information, see the vendor's site found at the following link.

http://edocs.bea.com/wls/docs60/adminguide/apache.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a stack based buffer overflow vulnerability in
Oracle Corp.'s WebLogic Server Apache Connector could allow an attacker
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected service.

A stack based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Apache
Connector of Oracle (formerly BEA) WebLogic Server. When parsing a
request with an invalid parameter the module uses a string without
properly validating its length. This string is copied into a fixed
sized stack buffer. This results in a stack based buffer overflow.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the affected service, usually SYSTEM. The
vulnerability is a stack based buffer overflow, and many of the modules
are not compiled with SAFESEH enabled, so it is trivial to exploit
resulting in attacker supplied code being executed.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in WebLogic
Server Apache Connector version 10.0. Previous versions may also be
affected.

V. WORKAROUND

Editing the httpd.conf file and adding 'LimitRequestFieldsize 4000' in
the global configuration area will prevent exploitation. However, users
will be unable to submit request parameters that are longer than 4000
bytes.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Oracle has released a Critical Patch Update (CPU) for October 2008 which
addresses these issues. For more information, consult their advisory at
the following URL.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2008-4008 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
security problems.
