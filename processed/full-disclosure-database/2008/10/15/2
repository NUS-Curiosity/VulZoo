Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 10.14.08: Sun Java Web
 Proxy Server FTP Resource Handling Heap-Based Buffer Overflow

iDefense Security Advisory 10.09.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Oct 09, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Sun Microsystems Inc's Java System is a collection of server
applications bundled together. One such server application included is
the Web Proxy Server. This software implements proxy services including
HTTP and SOCKSv5.

For more information, visit
http://www.sun.com/software/products/web_proxy/home_web_proxy.xml.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap based buffer overflow in Sun Microsystems
Inc.'s Sun Java Web Proxy could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
code.

A heap based buffer overflow exists in the handling of FTP resources.
Specifically the vulnerability resides within the code responsible for
handling HTTP GET requests.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code
on the server. An attacker would need to locate the vulnerable server
and construct a malicious HTTP GET request. The attacker would then
send the HTTP GET request to the Sun Java Web Proxy Server and upon
processing the request execution of arbitrary code would be possible.

IV. DETECTION

Sun Java System Web Proxy Server 4.0 through 4.0.7 is vulnerable in the
following versions:
