4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in HP SiteScope, which
can be exploited by malicious people to conduct script insertion
attacks.
 
The SiteScope server performs agent-less monitoring of the IT
infrastructure and can be configured to receive SNMP traps from 
devices. The status of the SNMP monitor and the content of received 
SNMP trap messages can be viewed in the web interface. The received 
SNMP messages are rendered in the context of the management interface 
with no filtering or sanitising. This can be exploited to execute 
arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session when 
viewing the information.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

Do not view SNMP traps.

======================================================================
