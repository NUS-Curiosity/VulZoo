Synopsis
========

A search path vulnerability in Portage allows local attackers to
execute commands with root privileges if emerge is called from
untrusted directories.

Background
==========

Portage is Gentoo's package manager which is responsible for
installing, compiling and updating all packages on the system through
the Gentoo rsync tree.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  sys-apps/portage      < 2.1.4.5                        >= 2.1.4.5

Description
===========

The Gentoo Security Team discovered that several ebuilds, such as
sys-apps/portage, net-mail/fetchmail or app-editors/leo execute Python
code using "python -c", which includes the current working directory in
Python's module search path. For several ebuild functions, Portage did
not change the working directory from emerge's working directory.

Impact
======

A local attacker could place a specially crafted Python module in a
directory (such as /tmp) and entice the root user to run commands such
as "emerge sys-apps/portage" from that directory, resulting in the
execution of arbitrary Python code with root privileges.

Workaround
==========

Do not run "emerge" from untrusted working directories.

Resolution
==========

All Portage users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # cd /root
    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-apps/portage-2.1.4.5"

NOTE: To upgrade to Portage 2.1.4.5 using 2.1.4.4 or prior, you must
run emerge from a trusted working directory, such as "/root".
