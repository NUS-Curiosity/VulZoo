 Mandriva Linux Security Advisory                         MDVSA-2008:217
 http://www.mandriva.com/security/
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Package : lynx
 Date    : October 28, 2008
 Affected: Corporate 3.0, Corporate 4.0, Multi Network Firewall 2.0
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Problem Description:

 A flaw was found in the way Lynx handled .mailcap and .mime.types
 configuration files.  If these files were present in the current
 working directory, they would be loaded prior to similar files in
 the user's home directory.  This could allow a local attacker to
 possibly execute arbitrary code as the user running Lynx, if they
 could convince the user to run Lynx in a directory under their control
 (CVE-2006-7234).
 
 A vulnerability was found in the Lynxcgi: URI handler that could allow
 an attacker to create a web page redirecting to a malicious URL that
 would execute arbitrary code as the user running Lynx, if they were
 using the non-default Advanced user mode (CVE-2008-4690).
 
 This update corrects these issues and, in addition, makes Lynx always
 prompt the user before loading a lynxcgi: URI.  As well, the default
 lynx.cfg configuration file marks all lynxcgi: URIs as untrusted.
