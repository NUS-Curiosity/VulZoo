   packages.

3. Problem Description

  a.  Privilege escalation on 64-bit guest operating systems

    VMware products emulate hardware functions, like CPU, Memory, and
    IO.

    A flaw in VMware's CPU hardware emulation could allow the
    virtual CPU to jump to an incorrect memory address. Exploitation of
    this issue on the guest operating system does not lead to a
    compromise of the host system but could lead to a privilege
    escalation on guest operating system.  An attacker would need to
    have a user account on the guest operating system.

    Affected
    64-bit Windows and 64-bit FreeBSD guest operating systems and
    possibly other 64-bit operating systems. The issue does not
    affect the 64-bit versions of Linux guest operating systems.

    VMware would like to thank Derek Soeder for discovering
    this issue and working with us on its remediation.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-4279 this issue.

    The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
    (column 4) if a solution is available.

    NOTE: The set of guest operating systems which is affected by
          this issue is a subset of 64-bit operating systems
          (see above for details)

 b. Update for VirtualCenter fixes a potential information disclosure

   This release resolves an issue where a user's password could be
   displayed in cleartext. When logging into VirtualCenter Server 2.0
   with Virtual Infrastructure Client 2.5, the user password might be
   displayed if it contains certain special characters. The dialog
   box displaying the password can appear in front or hidden behind
   other windows.

   To remediate this issue the VirtualCenter client installations must
   be updated after updating to VirtualCenter Update 3

   VMware would like to thank Mark Woollatt for reporting this issue
   to VMware.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
   has assigned the name CVE-2008-4278 to this issue.

   The following table lists what action remediates the vulnerability
   (column 4) if a solution is available.

 c. Update for VirtualCenter updates JRE to version 1.5.0_16

   Update for VirtualCenter updates the JRE package to version 1.5.0_16,
   which addresses multiple security issues that existed in the previous
   version of JRE.

   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
   has assigned the names CVE-2008-3103, CVE-2008-3104, CVE-2008-3105,
   CVE-2008-3106, CVE-2008-3107, CVE-2008-3108, CVE-2008-3109,
   CVE-2008-3110, CVE-2008-3111, CVE-2008-3112, CVE-2008-3113,
   CVE-2008-3114, CVE-2008-3115 to the security issues fixed in
   JRE 1.5.0_16.

 Notes: These vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely only if the
        attacker has access to the Service Console network.
        Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
        Service Console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
        http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726 for more
        information on VMware security best practices.

        The currently installed version of JRE depends on your patch
        deployment history.
