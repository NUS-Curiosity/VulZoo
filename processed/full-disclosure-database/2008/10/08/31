-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Novell eDirectory. Authentication is not
required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw resides in the web console running on TCP ports 8028
and 8030. The server exposes a web interface and accepts SOAP
connections. The service copies the contents of the Accept-Language
header within a SOAP request into a fixed-length buffer without any
bounds checking. If an attacker sends a specially crafted request it
will trigger an overflow during a memory copy operation leading to
arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
Novell has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
