ZDI-08-036: CA ETrust Secure Content Manager Gateway FTP LIST Stack 
Overflow

June 4, 2008

-- CVE ID:
CVE-2008-2541

-- Affected Vendors:
Computer Associates

-- Affected Products:
Computer Associates eTrust Secure Content Manager

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Computer Associates eTrust Secure Content
Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists in the HTTP Gateway service icihttp.exe running
on port 8080. When issuing a request for a FTP service the process tries
to decorate the contents of the transaction. In this particular case by
specifying a overly long response to a LIST command a stack buffer can
be overflowed. Successful exploitation can lead to complete system
compromise under the SYSTEM context.

-- Vendor Response:
Computer Associates has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
