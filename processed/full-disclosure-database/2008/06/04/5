Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.03.08: Sun Java
 System Active Server Pages Multiple Command Injection Vulnerabilities

iDefense Security Advisory 06.03.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 03, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Sun Java System Active Server Pages is a multi-platform ASP application
server. It provides provides ASP (Active Server Pages) functionality to
a web server. More information is available at the following URL.

http://www.sun.com/software/chilisoft/index.xml

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of multiple command injection vulnerabilities in Sun
Microsystem's Java System Active Server Pages allows attackers to
execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

These vulnerabilities exist within several ASP applications that execute
shell commands. The problem lies in the fact that these applications do
not filter or escape the parameters passed to these commands. By
inserting shell meta-characters into an HTTP request, an attacker is
able to execute arbitrary shell commands.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with
elevated privileges. Since this server runs with root privileges, an
attacker could gain complete control of the affected the system.

Note that authentication is required to reach these ASP applications via
the administration server on TCP port 5100. However, several methods of
bypassing and circumventing authentication have been discovered,
rendering that requirement irrelevant.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of these vulnerabilities within
version 4.0.2 of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Java System Active Server
Pages. Older versions are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

Removing the affected ASP applications from the system can prevent
exploitation of these vulnerabilities.

Additionally, using firewalls to limit access to the administration
server (TCP port 5100) and the ASP application server (TCP port 5102)
can help mitigate these issues.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Sun Microsystems has addressed these vulnerabilities with the release of
version 4.0.3 of Sun Java System Active Server Pages. For more
information, refer to Sun Alert 238184 at the following URL.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2008-2405 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
security problems.
