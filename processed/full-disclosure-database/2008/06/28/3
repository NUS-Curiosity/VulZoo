Description:
    Previous versions of the kernel package contain multiple
    vulnerabilities, the most serious of which can allow an unprivileged
    user to cause a denial of service.
    
    In addition, an issue which made the kernel unbootable as a guest in
    Microsoft Virtual Server has been resolved.
    
    A system reboot is required to resolve these issues.
