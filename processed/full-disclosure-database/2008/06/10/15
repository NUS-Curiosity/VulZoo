-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a
malicious file.

The specific flaw exists in the handling of SMIL text embedded in video
formats. No sanity checking is performed on values of the qt:next
attribute. When the URI for this attribute is a file type not recognized
by QuickTime, it is passed to url.dll!FileProtocolHandler which will
allow explorer.exe handle non-http filetypes. Successful exploitation
can result in the execution of arbitrary code.

-- Vendor Response:
Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222
