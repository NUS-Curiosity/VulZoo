Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X.Org X server,
possibly allowing for the remote execution of arbitrary code with root
privileges.

Background
==========

The X Window System is a graphical windowing system based on a
client/server model.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package               /   Vulnerable   /               Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1  x11-base/xorg-server     < 1.3.0.0-r6               >= 1.3.0.0-r6

Description
===========

Regenrecht reported multiple vulnerabilities in various X server
extensions via iDefense:

* The SProcSecurityGenerateAuthorization() and
   SProcRecordCreateContext() functions of the RECORD and Security
   extensions are lacking proper parameter validation (CVE-2008-1377).

* An integer overflow is possible in the function ShmPutImage() of
   the MIT-SHM extension (CVE-2008-1379).

* The RENDER extension contains several possible integer overflows in
   the AllocateGlyph() function (CVE-2008-2360) which could possibly
   lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. Further possible integer
   overflows have been found in the ProcRenderCreateCursor() function
   (CVE-2008-2361) as well as in the SProcRenderCreateLinearGradient(),
   SProcRenderCreateRadialGradient() and
   SProcRenderCreateConicalGradient() functions (CVE-2008-2362).

Impact
======

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could possibly lead to the remote
execution of arbitrary code with root privileges, if the server is
running as root, which is the default. It is also possible to crash the
server by making use of these vulnerabilities.

Workaround
==========

It is possible to avoid these vulnerabilities by disabling the affected
server extensions. Therefore edit the configuration file
(/etc/X11/xorg.conf) to contain the following in the appropriate
places:

       Section "Extensions"
     	Option "MIT-SHM" "disable"
     	Option "RENDER" "disable"
     	Option "SECURITY" "disable"
       EndSection

       Section "Module"
        Disable "record"
       EndSection

Resolution
==========

All X.org X Server users should upgrade to the latest version:

     # emerge --sync
     # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=x11-base/xorg-server-1.3.0.0-r6"
