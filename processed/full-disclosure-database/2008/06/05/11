Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 06.04.08: VMware
 Multiple Products vmware-authd Untrusted Library Loading Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 06.04.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Jun 04, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

VMware Inc. markets several virtualization products which allow multiple
virtual computers to run on a single system. For more information visit
the following URL.

http://www.vmware.com/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of an untrusted library path vulnerability in
multiple products distributed by VMware Inc. could allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

The Linux version of VMware products include a program called
'vmware-authd', which is installed set-uid root. When this program is
executed, it reads configuration options from the executing user's
VMware configuration file. One such option allows the user to specify
the directory in which to look for shared library modules needed by the
program. By loading a specially crafted library, an attacker can execute
arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the execution of arbitrary
code with root privileges. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker must have access to execute the set-uid vmware-authd binary on
an affected system. No additional credentials are needed.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in the following
VMware products.

  VMware Workstation 6.0.2.59824 for Linux
  VMware GSX Server 3.2.1.14497 for Linux
  VMware ESX Server 3.0.1.32039

All versions of all products which include a set-uid vmware-authd binary
are suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

To prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, modify the file
permissions for the vmware-authd set-uid binary. Possible choices
include removing the set-uid bit, or only allowing members of a trusted
group to execute the binary.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

VMware has addressed this vulnerability by release new versions of their
products. For more information, consult their advisory at the following
URL.
