Are you sick of being laughed at and not getting the respect you
deserve for releasing XSS?

Web Application Security Awareness Day, it brings the respect you
deserve back!!!

What does it mean to take part? You'll be part of a day when web
application bugs are being released, you'll be part of a landmark day
in infosec history, when we talk with one voice to send a message to
the powers that be.

White papers, research, bugs, tips, everything to do with Web
Application Security will be released & discussed.

This is your day to shine, its Web Application Security Awareness Day,
a new and innovative day brought to you by n3td3v.
