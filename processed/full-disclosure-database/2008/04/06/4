Synopsis
========

A double free vulnerability discovered in UnZip might lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Info-ZIP's UnZip is a tool to list and extract files inside PKZIP
compressed files.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /  Vulnerable  /                       Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-arch/unzip      < 5.52-r2                          >= 5.52-r2

Description
===========

Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered that the NEEDBITS
macro in the inflate_dynamic() function in the file inflate.c can be
invoked using invalid buffers, which can lead to a double free.

Impact
======

Remote attackers could entice a user or automated system to open a
specially crafted ZIP file that might lead to the execution of
arbitrary code or a Denial of Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All UnZip users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-arch/unzip-5.52-r2"
