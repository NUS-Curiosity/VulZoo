Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Opera, allowing for
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Opera is a fast web browser that is available free of charge.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /  Vulnerable  /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-client/opera       < 9.27                             >= 9.27

Description
===========

Michal Zalewski reported two vulnerabilities, memory corruption when
adding news feed sources from a website (CVE-2008-1761) as well as when
processing HTML CANVAS elements to use scaled images (CVE-2008-1762).
Additionally, an unspecified weakness related to keyboard handling of
password inputs has been reported (CVE-2008-1764).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to visit a specially crafted web
site or news feed and possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Opera.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Opera users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/opera-9.27"
