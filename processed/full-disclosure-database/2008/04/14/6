4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Lotus 
Notes, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a 
user's system.

1) A boundary error in the EML reader (emlsr.dll) when parsing certain
headers ("To:", "Cc:", "Bcc:", "From:", "Date:", "Subject:",
"Priority:", "Importance:", and "X-MSMail-Priority:") in EML files can
be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via an overly long
string.

2) A boundary error in the EML reader (emlsr.dll) when encountering the
beginning of RFC2047 encoded-words in headers can be exploited to cause
a heap-based buffer overflow via an overly long string.

3) A boundary error in the EML reader (emlsr.dll) when parsing the text
string in RFC2047 encoded-words in headers can be exploited to cause a
heap-based buffer overflow via an overly long string.

4) A boundary error in the EML reader (emlsr.dll) when creating a
filename based on the subject in an EML file can be exploited to cause 
a heap-based buffer overflow via an overly long string.
