4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability in Internet Explorer,
which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a user's
system.

The vulnerability is caused due to an error when processing data
streams and can be exploited to trigger a use-after-free condition by

MIME-type for which no handler is registered.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a user
visits a malicious website.
