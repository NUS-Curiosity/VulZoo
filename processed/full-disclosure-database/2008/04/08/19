Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.08.08: Microsoft
 HxTocCtrl ActiveX Control Invalid Param Heap Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.08.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 08, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

The HxTocCtrl ActiveX Control is a library used by the Microsoft Help
engine. More information is available at the following website.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Help_2

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a heap corruption vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Microsoft Help 2.5 ActiveX control allows an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user.

Microsoft Help 2.5 installs the following ActiveX control, which is
marked as safe for scripting:

ProgID: HxVz.HxTocCtrl.1
CLSID: 314111B8-A502-11D2-BBCA-00C04F8EC294
File: %PROGRAM DIR%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Help\hxvz.dll

By providing malformed arguments to this control, it is possible to
corrupt heap memory.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the logged-on user. Exploitation would require an
attacker to host a maliciously crafted page on a website and entice
users to visit that site. No further action is needed other than
following a link to a malicious website. Exploitation requires that
users have the specified control installed.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed this vulnerability in version 2.05.50727.42 of
