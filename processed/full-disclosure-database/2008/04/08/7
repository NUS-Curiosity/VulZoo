ZDI-08-020: Microsoft GDI WMF Parsing Heap Overflow Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-08-020


-- CVE ID:
CVE-2008-1083

-- Affected Vendors:
Microsoft

-- Affected Products:
Microsoft Windows XP SP2
Microsoft Windows 2003 SP1
Microsoft Windows Vista

-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is
required in that a user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious
web page.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of malformed WMF files. A
vulnerability exists in the GDI funcion CreateDIBPatternBrushPt used
when processing WMF files.  Due to a mis-calculation of user data a heap
chunk can be under-allocated and later used resulting in a heap
overflow. Successful exploitation can result in system compromise under
the credentials of the currently logged in user.

-- Vendor Response:
Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
