Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in CUPS, allowing for the
remote execution of arbitrary code and a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX-based operating
systems.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-print/cups      < 1.2.12-r7                      >= 1.2.12-r7

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in CUPS:

* regenrecht (VeriSign iDefense) discovered that the
  cgiCompileSearch() function used in several CGI scripts in CUPS'
  administration interface does not correctly calculate boundaries when
  processing a user-provided regular expression, leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2008-0047).

* Helge Blischke reported a double free() vulnerability in the
  process_browse_data() function when adding or removing remote shared
  printers (CVE-2008-0882).

* Tomas Hoger (Red Hat) reported that the gif_read_lzw() function
  uses the code_size value from GIF images without properly checking
  it, leading to a buffer overflow (CVE-2008-1373).

* An unspecified input validation error was discovered in the HP-GL/2
  filter (CVE-2008-0053).

Impact
======

A local attacker could send specially crafted network packets or print
jobs and possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running CUPS (usually lp), or cause a Denial of Service. The
vulnerabilities are exploitable via the network when CUPS is sharing
printers remotely.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.2.12-r7"
