Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.09.08: IBM DB2
 Universal Database Administration Server File Creation Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.09.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 09, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

IBM Corp.'s DB2 Universal Database product is a large database server
product commonly used for high-end databases. The DB2 Administration
Server (DAS) implements the server component to which the Java-based
DB2 Control Center GUI connects. For more information, visit the
product website at the following URL.

http://ibm.com/db2/

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a file creation vulnerability in the
Administration Server of IBM Corp.'s DB2 Universal Database allows
attackers to elevate privileges to root.

This vulnerability exists due to unsafe file access from within the
db2dasrrm program. When a user starts the DAS, the "db2dasrrm" process
is started with root privileges. As part of the initialization, the
"dasRecoveryIndex", "dasRecoveryIndex.tmp", ".dasRecoveryIndex.lock",
and "dasRecoveryIndex.cor" files are created with root privileges. By
removing and re-creating these files as symbolic links, an attacker can
create arbitrary files as root.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows local attackers to gain root privileges. In order to
exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to an account
that is allowed to start and stop the DB2 Administration Server. For
example, the "dasusr1" account or an account with access to the
"db2adm1" group.

It should be noted that an attacker does not appear to any control over
the contents of the data written. However, this does not significantly
impact exploitation since the file is created using the user's umask
and group.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in IBM
Corp.'s DB2 Universal Database 9.1 release with Fix Pack 3 installed on
Linux. Other versions are also suspected to be vulnerable.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue.
