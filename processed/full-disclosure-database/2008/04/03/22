Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 04.02.08: Borland
 CaliberRM StarTeam Multicast Service Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 04.02.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 02, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Borland CaliberRM is an enterprise software requirements management
system. It is part of Borland's distributed development and deployment
solution. For more information about Borland CaliberRM, please visit
following website.

http://www.borland.com/us/products/caliber/index.html

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a buffer overflow vulnerability in Borland
Software Corp.'s CaliberRM enterprise software requirements management
system could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM
level privileges.

This vulnerability exists in the StarTeam Multicast Service component
(STMulticastService). This service is implemented using the HTTP
protocol. The vulnerable function, PGMWebHandler::parse_request, is
shown below.

  .text:003AA15D call PGMWebHandler::parse_request(char const 
*,uint,char *,uint,http_request_info_t &)
  ...
  .text:003AA35E loc_3AA35E:
  .text:003AA35E mov al, [ebx]
  .text:003AA360 cmp al, 0Ah
  .text:003AA362 mov [edx], al ; edx points to the stack, overflowable 
because of the loop
  .text:003AA364 jnz loc_3AA4EF
  ...
  .text:003AA36A mov byte ptr [edx+1], 0
  .text:003AA36E mov al, byte ptr [esp+618h+lbuff]
  .text:003AA372 cmp al, 0Dh
  .text:003AA374 jz loc_3AA509
  ...
  .text:003AA4F0 loc_3AA4F0:
  .text:003AA4F0 mov eax, [esp+618h+count]
  .text:003AA4F4 mov ecx, [esp+618h+req_len]
  .text:003AA4FB inc ebx
  .text:003AA4FC inc eax
  .text:003AA4FD cmp eax, ecx
  .text:003AA4FF mov [esp+618h+count], eax
  .text:003AA503 jl loc_3AA35E ; loop back up

While searching for the standard 0x0a0d that ends HTTP requests, a loop
copies attacker supplied data byte by byte into a fixed-size stack
buffer. If a large enough request is sent, the return address, SEH
pointers, and other stack data is overwritten.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM
level privileges. In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker
would have to send malicious data to the STMulticastService service
listening on TCP port 3057.

The StarTeam Multicast service is not installed by default with
CaliberRM 2006. The user must enable MPX Events and the StarTeam
Message Broker option during the installation process.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed that the trial version of Borland CaliberRM 2006
(file version 9.0.809.000) is vulnerable. The actual vulnerable
component is StarTeam Multicast Service 6.4. Other Borland products
containing StarTeam Multicast Service component, such as Borland
StarTeam, may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

In order to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, administrators
can disable the Multicast Service monitoring port. For more information
consult Borland's Knowledge Base at the following URL.

http://support.borland.com/kbshow.php?q=29083

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Borland Software Corp. has not responded to repeated inquiries regarding
this vulnerability. iDefense Labs confirmed that the current version
(Borland CaliberRM 2008) still contains the vulnerable code. However,
the monitoring port appears to be disabled in a default installation.

VII. CVE INFORMATION

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the
name CVE-2008-0311 to this issue. This is a candidate for inclusion in
the CVE list (http://cve.mitre.org/), which standardizes names for
security problems.
