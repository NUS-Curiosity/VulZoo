iDefense Security Advisory 04.02.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Apr 02, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Norton Internet Security 2008 is a system security suite that offers
protection from spyware, viruses, identity theft, spam, and malicious
network traffic. More information can be found on the vendor's site at
the following URL.

http://www.symantec.com/home_homeoffice/products/overview.jsp?pcid=is&pvid=nis2008

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a design error in an ActiveX control installed
with Symantec Norton Internet Security 2008 could allow for the
execution of arbitrary code.

Norton Internet Security 2008 installs the following ActiveX control
which is registered as safe for scripting:

  Progid: SymAData.ActiveDataInfo.1
  Clsid: 3451DEDE-631F-421c-8127-FD793AFC6CC8
  File: C:\PROGRA~1\COMMON~1\SYMANT~1\SUPPOR~1\SymAData.dll
  Version:  2.7.0.1

This control contains functionality designed to allow Symantec to
remotely execute programs on the target machine.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the currently logged in user. In order for exploitation
to occur, an attacker would have to lure a vulnerable user to a
malicious web site.

While this control is marked as safe for scripting, the control has been
designed so that it can only be run from the "symantec.com" domain. In
practice this requirement can be bypassed through the use of any Cross
Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Symantec domain.
Exploitation could also occur through the use of DNS poisoning attacks.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense confirmed that this vulnerability exists in version 2.7.0.1 of
the control that is installed with the 2008 version of Norton Internet
Security. Other versions may also be available.

V. WORKAROUND

Setting the kill-bit for this control will prevent it from being loaded
within Internet Explorer. However, doing so will prevent legitimate use
of the control.
