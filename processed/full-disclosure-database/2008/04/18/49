Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in CUPS might allow for the execution of arbitrary code
or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX-based operating
systems.

Affected packages
=================

     -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package         /   Vulnerable   /                     Unaffected
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
   1  net-print/cups      < 1.2.12-r8                      >= 1.2.12-r8

Description
===========

Thomas Pollet reported a possible integer overflow vulnerability in the
PNG image handling in the file filter/image-png.c.

Impact
======

A malicious user might be able to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running CUPS (usually lp), or cause a Denial of
Service by sending a specially crafted PNG image to the print server.
The vulnerability is exploitable via the network if CUPS is sharing
printers remotely.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

     # emerge --sync
     # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.2.12-r8"
