Advisory ID:       VMSA-2008-0007
Synopsis:          Moderate Updated Service Console packages pcre
~                   net-snmp, and OpenPegasus
Issue date:        2008-04-15
Updated on:        2008-04-15 (initial release of advisory)
CVE numbers:       CVE-2006-7228 CVE-2007-1660 CVE-2007-5846
~                   CVE-2008-0003
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary:

~   Updated Service Console packages for pcre, net-snmp, and OpenPegasus

2. Relevant releases:

~   VMware ESX 3.5 without patch ESX350-200803214-UG

3. Problem description:

~   a. Updated pcre Service Console package addresses several security issues

~   The pcre package contains the Perl-Compatible Regular Expression library.
~   pcre is used by various Service Console utilities.

~   Several security issues were discovered in the way PCRE handles
~   regular expressions. If an application linked against PCRE parsed a
~   malicious regular expression, it may have been possible to run
~   arbitrary code as the user running the application.

~   VMware would like to thank Ludwig Nussel for reporting these issues.

~   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
~   assigned the names CVE-2006-7228 and CVE-2007-1660 to these issues.

~   RPM Updated:
~   pcre-3.9-10.4.i386.rpm

~   b. Updated net-snmp Service Console package addresses denial of service

~   net-snmp is an implementation of the Simple Network Management
~   Protocol (SNMP).  SNMP is used by network management systems to
~   monitor hosts.  By default ESX has this service enabled and its ports
~   open on the ESX firewall.

~   A flaw was discovered in the way net-snmp handled certain requests. A
~   remote attacker who can connect to the snmpd UDP port could send a
~   malicious packet causing snmpd to crash, resulting in a denial of
~   service.

~   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
~   assigned the name CVE-2007-5846 to this issue.

~   RPM Updated:
~   net-snmp-5.0.9-2.30E.23.i386.rpm
~   net-snmp-libs-5.0.9-2.30E.23.i386.rpm
~   net-snmp-utils-5.0.9-2.30E.23.i386.rpm

~   c. Updated OpenPegasus Service Console package fixes overflow condition

~   OpenPegasus is a CIM (Common Information Model) and Web-Based Enterprise
~   Management (WBEM) broker.  These protocols are used by network management
~   systems to monitor and control hosts.  By default ESX has this service
~   enabled and its ports open on the ESX firewall.

~   A flaw was discovered in the OpenPegasus CIM management server that
~   might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.  OpenPegasus
~   when compiled to use PAM and without PEGASUS_USE_PAM_STANDALONE_PROC
~   defined, has a stack-based buffer overflow condition.

~   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has
~   assigned the name CVE-2008-0003 to this issue.

~   RPMS updated:
~   cim-smwg-1.0-release-606113.i386.rpm
~   pegasus-2.5-release-606113.i386.rpm
