Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC, allowing for the execution
of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/vlc      < 0.8.6f                           >= 0.8.6f

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in VLC:

* Luigi Auriemma discovered that the stack-based buffer overflow when
  reading subtitles, which has been reported as CVE-2007-6681 in GLSA
  200803-13, was not properly fixed (CVE-2008-1881).

* Alin Rad Pop of Secunia reported an array indexing vulnerability in
  the sdpplin_parse() function when processing streams from RTSP
  servers in Xine code, which is also used in VLC (CVE-2008-0073).

* Drew Yao and Nico Golde reported an integer overflow in the
  MP4_ReadBox_rdrf() function in the file libmp4.c leading to a
  heap-based buffer overflow when reading MP4 files (CVE-2008-1489).

* Drew Yao also reported integer overflows in the MP4 demuxer, the
  Real demuxer and in the Cinepak codec, which might lead to buffer
  overflows (CVE-2008-1768).

* Drew Yao finally discovered and a boundary error in Cinepak, which
  might lead to memory corruption (CVE-2008-1769).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media
file or stream, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6f"
