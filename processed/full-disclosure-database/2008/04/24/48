Package        : phpmyadmin
Vulnerability  : insufficient input sanitising
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id(s)      : CVE-2008-1149 CVE-2008-1567 CVE-2008-1924

Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin,
an application to administrate MySQL over the WWW. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2008-1924

    Attackers with CREATE table permissions were allowed to read
    arbitrary files readable by the webserver via a crafted
    HTTP POST request.

CVE-2008-1567

    The PHP session data file stored the username and password of
    a logged in user, which in some setups can be read by a local
    user.

CVE-2008-1149

    Cross site scripting and SQL injection were possible by attackers
    that had permission to create cookies in the same cookie domain
    as phpMyAdmin runs in.

For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:2.9.1.1-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:2.11.5.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.

Upgrade instructions
- --------------------

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

If you are using the apt-get package manager, use the line for
sources.list as given below:

apt-get update
        will update the internal database
apt-get upgrade
        will install corrected packages

You may use an automated update by adding the resources from the
footer to the proper configuration.
