Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in VLC may allow for the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  media-video/vlc      < 0.8.6i                           >= 0.8.6i

Description
===========

* Remi Denis-Courmont reported that VLC loads plugins from the
    current working directory in an unsafe manner (CVE-2008-2147).

* Alin Rad Pop (Secunia Research) reported an integer overflow error
    in the Open() function in the file modules/demux/wav.c
    (CVE-2008-2430).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted .wav
file, and a local attacker could entice a user to run VLC from a
directory containing specially crafted modules, possibly resulting in
the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6i"
