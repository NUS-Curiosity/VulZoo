====================================================================== 
4) Description of Vulnerability

Secunia Research has discovered two vulnerabilities in K9 Web 
Protection, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise
a user's system.

The vulnerabilities are caused by boundary errors in the filter 
service (k9filter.exe) when handling HTTP version information in 
responses from a centralised server (sp.cwfservice.net). These can be
exploited to cause stack-based buffer overflows via a specially 
crafted response containing overly long HTTP version information.

Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but
requires that requests to the centralised server can be redirected to
a malicious service or otherwise intercepted.

====================================================================== 
5) Solution 

The vendor is reportedly working on a fixed version, which may be
available shortly.

             provided beta release).
03/03/2008 - New beta release provided with vulnerabilities fixed.
             Vendor informs that scheduled ship date was missed due to 
             stability issues in fixed version.
13/05/2008 - Status update requested.

             Vendor also states that customer impact is considered
             minimal as exploitation requires access to the user's
             system.
19/05/2008 - Vendor contacted, clarifying remote attack vector of the
             vulnerability using e.g. Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
17/07/2008 - Status update requested. Vendor informed that disclosure
             date will not be pushed again as coordination now has 
             taken more than a year from initial vulnerability report.
31/07/2008 - Public disclosure.
