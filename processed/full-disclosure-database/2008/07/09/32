Synopsis
========

An integer overflow vulnerability has been reported in OpenOffice.org.

Background
==========

OpenOffice.org is an open source office productivity suite, including
word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, drawing, data charting,
formula editing, and file conversion facilities.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------

    -------------------------------------------------------------------

Description
===========

Sean Larsson (iDefense Labs) reported an integer overflow in the
function rtl_allocateMemory() in the file
sal/rtl/source/alloc_global.c.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All OpenOffice.org users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-2.4.1"

All OpenOffice.org binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-2.4.1"
