Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in Bacula may allow local attackers to obtain sensitive
information.

Background
==========

Bacula is a network based backup suite.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  app-backup/bacula       < 2.4.1                          >= 2.4.1

Description
===========

Matthijs Kooijman reported that the "make_catalog_backup" script uses
the MySQL password as a command line argument when invoking other
programs.

Impact
======

A local attacker could list the processes on the local machine when the
script is running to obtain the MySQL password. Note: The password
could also be disclosed via network sniffing attacks when the script
fails, in which case it would be sent via cleartext e-mail.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

A warning about this issue has been added in version 2.4.1, but the
issue is still unfixed. We advise not to use the make_catalog_backup
script, but to put all MySQL parameters into a dedicated file readable
only by the user running Bacula.
