Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability in PeerCast may allow for the remote
execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

PeerCast is a client and server for P2P-radio networks.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /   Vulnerable   /               Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-sound/peercast      < 0.1218-r1                >= 0.1218-r1

Description
===========

Nico Golde reported a boundary error in the HTTP::getAuthUserPass()
function when processing overly long HTTP Basic authentication
requests.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request to the
vulnerable server, possibly resulting in the remote execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PeerCast users should upgrade to the latest version:

   # emerge --sync
   # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/peercast-0.1218-r1"
