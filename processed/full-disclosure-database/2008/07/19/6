Description:
    Previous versions of the bind package are vulnerable to a
    cache-poisoning attack due to a weakness in the DNS protocol.
    This update improves bind's resilience to this attack; however,
    it does not provide a definitive solution.
    
    Additionally, the bind package has been updated with root
    nameserver information, including the new IP address for 
    the "L" root nameserver.
