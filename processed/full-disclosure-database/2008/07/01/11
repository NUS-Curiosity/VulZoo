Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Motion might result in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Motion is a program that monitors the video signal from one or more
cameras and is able to detect motions.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package             /  Vulnerable  /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  media-video/motion     < 3.2.10.1                     >= 3.2.10.1

Description
===========

Nico Golde reported an off-by-one error within the read_client()
function in the webhttpd.c file, leading to a stack-based buffer
overflow. Stefan Cornelius (Secunia Research) reported a boundary error
within the same function, also leading to a stack-based buffer
overflow. Both vulnerabilities require that the HTTP Control interface
is enabled.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending an
overly long or specially crafted request to a vulnerable Motion HTTP
control interface, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the motion user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Motion users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/motion-3.2.10.1"

==========
