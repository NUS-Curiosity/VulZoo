Synopsis
========

An SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered in the Courier
Authentication Library.

Background
==========

The Courier Authentication Library is a generic authentication API that
encapsulates the process of validating account passwords.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package                   /  Vulnerable  /             Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  net-libs/courier-authlib      < 0.60.6                  >= 0.60.6

Description
===========

It has been discovered that some input (e.g. the username) passed to
the library are not properly sanitised before being used in SQL
queries.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could provide specially crafted input to the library,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary SQL commands.
NOTE: Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a MySQL database
is used for authentication and that a Non-Latin character set is
selected.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Courier Authentication Library users should upgrade to the latest
version:

  # emerge --sync
  # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/courier-authlib-0.60.6"
