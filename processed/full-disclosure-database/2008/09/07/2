Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities in VLC may lead to the remote execution of
arbitrary code.

Background
==========

VLC is a cross-platform media player and streaming server.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package          /   Vulnerable   /                    Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  media-video/vlc      < 0.8.6i-r2                     >= 0.8.6i-r2

Description
===========

g_ reported the following vulnerabilities:

* An integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the
    Open() function in modules/demux/tta.c (CVE-2008-3732).

* A signedness error leading to a stack-based buffer overflow in the
    mms_ReceiveCommand() function in modules/access/mms/mmstu.c
    (CVE-2008-3794).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All VLC users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-video/vlc-0.8.6i-r2"
