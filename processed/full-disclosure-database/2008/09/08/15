Synopsis
========

Multiple buffer underflow vulnerabilities in libTIFF may allow for the
remote execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libTIFF provides support for reading and manipulating TIFF (Tagged
Image File Format) images.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package          /  Vulnerable  /                      Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  media-libs/tiff     < 3.8.2-r4                        >= 3.8.2-r4

Description
===========

Drew Yao (Apple Product Security) and Clay Wood reported multiple
buffer underflows in the LZWDecode() and LZWDecodeCompat() functions in
tif_lzw.c when processing TIFF files.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted TIFF
file with an application making use of libTIFF, possibly resulting in
the remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libTIFF users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/tiff-3.8.2-r4"
