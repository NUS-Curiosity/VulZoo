Details
=======

The following sections provide details to help determine if a device
may be affected by any of the vulnerabilities.

Erroneous SIP Processing Vulnerabilities

Cisco PIX and Cisco ASA devices configured for SIP inspection are
vulnerable to multiple processing errors that may result in denial of
service attacks. All Cisco PIX and Cisco ASA software releases may be
vulnerable to these SIP processing vulnerabilities. A successful
attack may result in a reload of the device.

SIP inspection is enabled with the inspect sip command.

To determine whether the Cisco PIX or Cisco ASA security appliance is
configured to support inspection of sip packets, log in to the device
and issue the CLI command show service-policy | include sip. If the
output contains the text Inspect: sip and some statistics, then the
device has a vulnerable configuration. The following example shows a
vulnerable Cisco ASA Security Appliance:

    asa#show service-policy | include sip
          Inspect: sip, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0
    
    asa#

These vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco Bug IDs and
has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
identifier CVE-2008-2732.

  * CSCsq07867
  * CSCsq57091
  * CSCsk60581
  * CSCsq39315

IPSec Client Authentication Processing Vulnerability

Cisco PIX and Cisco ASA devices configured to terminate client based
VPN connections are vulnerable to a crafted authentication processing
vulnerability if they are running software versions 7.2, 8.0, or 8.1.
Devices that run software versions 7.0 or 7.1 are not affected by
this vulnerability.

A successful attack may result in a reload of the device.

Remote access VPN connections will have Internet Security Association
and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) enabled on an interface with the
crypto command, such as: crypto isakmp enable outside.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCso69942
and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
identifier CVE-2008-2733.

SSL VPN Memory Leak Vulnerability and URI Processing Error
Vulnerability in SSL VPNs

A crafted SSL or HTTP packet may cause a denial of service condition
on a Cisco ASA device that is configured to terminate clientless VPN
connections. A successful attack may result in a reload of the
device.

Cisco ASA devices that run versions 7.2, 8.0, or 8.1 with clientless
SSL VPNs enabled may be affected by this vulnerability. Devices that
run software versions 7.0 and 7.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability.

Clientless VPN, SSL VPN Client, and AnyConnect connections are
enabled via the webvpn command. For example, the following
configuration shows a Cisco ASA with Clientless VPNs configured and
enabled. In this case the ASA will listen for VPN connections on the
default port, TCP port 443:

    http server enable                                                              
    !
    webvpn
     enable outside

Note that with this particular configuration, the device is
vulnerable to attacks coming from the outside interface due to the 
enable outside command within the webvpn group configuration.

These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCso66472
and CSCsq19369. They have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) identifiers CVE-2008-2734 and CVE-2008-2735.

Potential Information Disclosure in Clientless VPNs

On Cisco ASA devices configured to terminate clientless VPN
connections, an attacker may be able to discover potentially
sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This attack
requires an attacker to convince a user to visit a rogue web server,
reply to an e-mail, or interact with a service to successfully
exploit the vulnerability.

Cisco ASA devices running software versions 8.0 or 8.1 with
clientless VPNs enabled may be affected by this vulnerability. Cisco
ASA devices running that run software versions 7.0, 7.1, or 7.2 are
not vulnerable to this vulnerability.

Clientless SSL VPN connections are enabled via the webvpn command.
For example, the following configuration shows a Cisco ASA device
with Clientless VPNs configured and enabled. In this case the Cisco
ASA device will listen for VPN connections on the default port, TCP
port 443:

    http server enable                                                              
    !
    webvpn
     enable outside

Note that with this particular configuration, the device is
vulnerable to attacks coming from the outside interface due to the 
enable outside command within the webvpn group configuration.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCsq45636 
and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
identifier CVE-2008-2736.

Workarounds
===========

The following workarounds may help some customers mitigate these
vulnerabilities.

Additional mitigation techniques that can be deployed on Cisco
devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied
Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:

http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-amb-20080903-asa.shtml

Erroneous SIP Processing Vulnerabilities

SIP inspection should be disabled if it is not needed and temporarily
disabling the feature will mitigate the SIP processing
vulnerabilities. SIP inspection can be disabled with the command no
inspect sip.

IPSec Authentication Processing Vulnerability

Use strong group credentials for remote access VPN connections and do
not give out the group credentials to end users.

SSL VPN Memory Leak Vulnerability and URI Processing Error
Vulnerability in SSL VPNs

IPSec clients are not vulnerable to this issue and may be used in
conjunction with strong group credentials until the device can be
upgraded.

Potential Information Disclosure in Clientless SSL VPNs

Client based VPN connections are not vulnerable to the information
disclosure vulnerability. If you are running 8.0(3)15, 8.0(3)16,
8.1(1)4, or 8.1(1)5, you may safely use client based VPN connections as
an alternative to clientless VPNs.

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/prod_warranties_item09186a008088e31f.html

or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at:

http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt@...co.com or security-alert@...co.com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's
worldwide website at http://www.cisco.com.

Customers using Third Party Support Organizations
+------------------------------------------------

Customers whose Cisco products are provided or maintained through
prior or existing agreements with third-party support organizations,
such as Cisco Partners, authorized resellers, or service providers
should contact that support organization for guidance and assistance
with the appropriate course of action in regards to this advisory.

The effectiveness of any workaround or fix is dependent on specific
customer situations, such as product mix, network topology, traffic
behavior, and organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected
products and releases, customers should consult with their service
provider or support organization to ensure any applied workaround or
fix is the most appropriate for use in the intended network before it
is deployed.

Customers without Service Contracts
+----------------------------------

Customers who purchase direct from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco
service contract, and customers who purchase through third-party
vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through
their point of sale should acquire upgrades by contacting the Cisco
Technical Assistance Center (TAC). TAC contacts are as follows.

  * +1 800 553 2447 (toll free from within North America)
  * +1 408 526 7209 (toll call from anywhere in the world)
  * e-mail: tac@...co.com

Customers should have their product serial number available and be
prepared to give the URL of this notice as evidence of entitlement to
a free upgrade. Free upgrades for non-contract customers must be
requested through the TAC.
