Synopsis
========

Insufficient input validation in newsbeuter may allow remote attackers
to execute arbitrary shell commands.

Background
==========

Newsbeuter is a RSS/Atom feed reader for the text console.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package              /  Vulnerable  /                  Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  net-news/newsbeuter        < 1.2                           >= 1.2

Description
===========

J.H.M. Dassen reported that the open-in-browser command does not
properly escape shell metacharacters in the URL before passing it to
system().

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a feed with specially
crafted URLs, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary
shell commands with the privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Newsbeuter users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-news/newsbeuter-1.2"
