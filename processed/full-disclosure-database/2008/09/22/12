Description

When configuring a web application to use only ssl (e. g. by forwarding all 
http-requests to https), a user would expect that sniffing and hijacking the 
session is impossible.

Though, for this to be secure, one needs to set the session cookie to have the 
secure flag. Else the cookie will be transferred through http if the victim's 
browser does a single http-request on the same domain.

Squirrelmail does not set that flag. It is fixed in the 1.5 test versions, but 
current 1.4.15 is vulnerable.
