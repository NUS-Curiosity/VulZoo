1. Summary

    Updated ESXi and ESX 3.5 packages address critical security issue in
    openwsman

2. Relevant releases

    VMware ESXi 3.5 Update 2 without patch ESXe350-200808501-I-SG

    VMware ESX  3.5 Update 2 without patch ESX350-200808413-SG

3. Problem Description

  a.  Updated Openwsman

    Openwsman is a system management platform that implements the Web
    Services Management protocol (WS-Management). It is installed and
    running by default. It is used in the VMware Management Service
    Console and in ESXi.

    The openwsman 2.0.0 management service on ESX 3.5 and ESXi 3.5 is
    vulnerable to the following issue found by the SuSE Security-Team:
    
    - Two remote buffer overflows while decoding the HTTP basic
      authentication header

    This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by users without
    valid login credentials.
 
    Openwsman before 2.0.0 is not vulnerable to this issue. The ESXi
    3.5 patch ESXe350-200808201-O-UG updated openwsman to version 2.0.0.
    The ESX 3.5 patch ESX350-200808205-UG updated openwsman to version
    2.0.0. These patches are installed as part of the ESX and ESXi
    Upgrade 2 release. The ESX patch can be installed individually.

    Version Information and Workaround
    The following VMware KB articles provide information on how to
    obtain the version of openwsman in your environment and what a
    possible workaround for the issue might be.
    ESXi 3.5
      Refer to the VMware KB article at http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1005818.
    ESX 3.5
      Refer to the VMware KB article at http://kb.vmware.com/kb/1006878.

    Note: This vulnerability can be exploited remotely only if the
          attacker has access to the service console network.
          Security best practices provided by VMware recommend that the
          service console be isolated from the VM network. Please see
          http://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/726 for more
          information on VMware security best practices.

    The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project (cve.mitre.org)
    has assigned the name CVE-2008-2234 this issue.
