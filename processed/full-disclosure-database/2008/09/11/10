Overview:

The Horde project is about creating high quality Open Source
applications, based on PHP and the Horde Framework.

The guiding principles of the Horde Project are to create solid
standards-based applications using intelligent object-oriented design
that, wherever possible, are designed to run on a wide range of
platforms and backends. There is great emphasis on making Horde as
friendly to non-English speakers as possible. The Horde Framework
currently supports many localization features such as unicode and
right-to-left text and generous users have contributed many translations
for the framework and applications.

Currently Horde Project boasts many applications, some already
enterprise-ready and deployed in demanding environments, and some
exciting new ones still in development.


Description:

The Horde Framework fails to properly sanitize the filename of MIME
attachments on received emails.


Impact:

While a webmail user is viewing an email with a malicously prepared
filename attachment, the attacker can highjack victim's account.
This allows him to send emails on behalf of the victim or to do other
arbitrary actions.


Solution:

references section [1] of this document.
