Synopsis
========

A vulnerability in yelp can lead to the execution of arbitrary code
when opening a URI, for example through Firefox.

Background
==========

yelp is the default help browser for GNOME.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  gnome-extra/yelp      < 2.22.1-r2                    >= 2.22.1-r2
                                                         *>= 2.20.0-r1

Description
===========

Aaron Grattafiori reported a format string vulnerability in the
window_error() function in yelp-window.c.

Impact
======

A remote attacker can entice a user to open specially crafted "man:" or
"ghelp:" URIs in yelp, or an application using yelp such as Firefox or
Evolution, and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that user.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All yelp users running GNOME 2.22 should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gnome-extra/yelp-2.22.1-r2"

All yelp users running GNOME 2.20 should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=gnome-extra/yelp-2.20.0-r1"
