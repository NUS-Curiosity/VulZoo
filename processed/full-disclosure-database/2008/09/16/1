-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of LANDesk Management Suite. Authentication is
not required to exploit this vulnerability.

The specific flaw exists within the QIP Server Service (qipsrvr.exe)
which listens by default on TCP port 12175. The process makes a
vulnerable call to MultiByteToWideChar using values obtained from packet
data. A malicious 'heal' request can allow an attacker to control both
the pointer to the StringToMap and the StringSize arguments. The
destination buffer is either allocated on the stack or heap depending on
the specified sizes. In both cases it can be overflown leading to
arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.

-- Vendor Response:
LANDesk has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More
details can be found at:
