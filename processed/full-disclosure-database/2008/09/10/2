Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 09.09.08: Microsoft
 Windows GDI+ Gradient Fill Heap Overflow Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 09.09.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Sep 09, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

The GDI+ library, or "GdiPlus.dll", provides access to a number of
graphics methods, via a class-based API. Vector Markup Language (VML)
is a component of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) that specifies
vector images (e.g., rectangles and ovals) using the GDI+ API. For more
information about these technologies, visit the following URLs.

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in multiple
versions of Microsoft Corp.'s GDI+ could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code within the context of the local user.

The vulnerability specifically exists in the memory allocation performed
by the GDI+ library. Certain malformed gradient fill input can cause the
application to corrupt the heap, potentially allowing arbitrary code
execution.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. To exploit this
vulnerability, the attacker would need to convince a targeted user to
render a document with an application that utilizes the vulnerable GDI+
functions. This could be accomplished by persuading the user to follow a
link, view a document, or read an e-mail message.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense Labs confirmed this vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 7
and Internet Explorer 6 on the Microsoft Windows XP SP2 platform. The
following versions of VGX.DLL were tested and found to be vulnerable:

  7.00.6000.20628
  7.00.6000.16386
  6.00.2900.3051
  6.00.2900.2997

While the VGX.DLL library (which handles VML) appears to be the most
likely vector, Microsoft have indicated to us that the GdiPlus.dll is
the root cause of the vulnerability. Version 5.1.3102.2180 of
GdiPlus.dll was installed on each of the tested systems.

V. WORKAROUND

In order to prevent exploitation of this vulnerability, unregister or
deny access to vgx.dll and/or gdiplus.dll. Note that doing so will
prevent proper rendering of documents that rely on the affected
component.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Microsoft has officially addressed this vulnerability with Security
Bulletin MS08-052. For more information, consult their bulletin at the
following URL.
