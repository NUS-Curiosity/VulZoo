Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ruby that allow for
attacks including arbitrary code execution and Denial of Service.

Background
==========

Ruby is an interpreted object-oriented programming language. The
elaborate standard library includes an HTTP server ("WEBRick") and a
class for XML parsing ("REXML").

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package        /     Vulnerable     /                  Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-lang/ruby      < 1.8.6_p287-r1               >= 1.8.6_p287-r1

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Ruby interpreter
and its standard libraries. Drew Yao of Apple Product Security
discovered the following flaws:

* Arbitrary code execution or Denial of Service (memory corruption)
  in the rb_str_buf_append() function (CVE-2008-2662).

* Arbitrary code execution or Denial of Service (memory corruption)
  in the rb_ary_stor() function (CVE-2008-2663).

* Memory corruption via alloca in the rb_str_format() function
  (CVE-2008-2664).

* Memory corruption ("REALLOC_N") in the rb_ary_splice() and
  rb_ary_replace() functions (CVE-2008-2725).

* Memory corruption ("beg + rlen") in the rb_ary_splice() and
  rb_ary_replace() functions (CVE-2008-2726).

Furthermore, several other vulnerabilities have been reported:

* Tanaka Akira reported an issue with resolv.rb that enables
  attackers to spoof DNS responses (CVE-2008-1447).

* Akira Tagoh of RedHat discovered a Denial of Service (crash) issue
  in the rb_ary_fill() function in array.c (CVE-2008-2376).

* Several safe level bypass vulnerabilities were discovered and
  reported by Keita Yamaguchi (CVE-2008-3655).

* Christian Neukirchen is credited for discovering a Denial of
  Service (CPU consumption) attack in the WEBRick HTTP server
  (CVE-2008-3656).

* A fault in the dl module allowed the circumvention of taintness
  checks which could possibly lead to insecure code execution was
  reported by "sheepman" (CVE-2008-3657).

* Tanaka Akira again found a DNS spoofing vulnerability caused by the
  resolv.rb implementation using poor randomness (CVE-2008-3905).

* Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek (ACROS Security) disclosed a Denial
  of Service (CPU consumption) vulnerability in the REXML module when
  dealing with recursive entity expansion (CVE-2008-3790).

Impact
======

These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code,
spoof DNS responses, bypass Ruby's built-in security and taintness
checks, and cause a Denial of Service via crash or CPU exhaustion.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Ruby users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/ruby-1.8.6_p287-r1"
