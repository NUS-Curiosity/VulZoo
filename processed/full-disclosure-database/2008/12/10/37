 Excel Malformed Object Memoy Corruption Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 12.09.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Dec 09, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Excel is the spreadsheet application included with Microsoft Corp.'s
Office productivity software suite. More information is available at
the following website:

http://office.microsoft.com/excel/

II. DESCRIPTION

Remote exploitation of a memory corruption vulnerability in Microsoft
Corp.'s Excel spreadsheet could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the current user.

This issue exists in the handling of certain malformed object records
within an Excel spreadsheet (XLS), allowing memory corruption to occur.
This could lead to an exploitable situation.

iDefense's proof of concept code can redirect the program execution flow
to a user controllable address on Excel 2000 SP3, and crash on other
versions of Excel, including Excel XP SP3, Excel 2003 SP3 and Excel
2007 SP1.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context
of the currently logged-on user. To exploit this vulnerability, the
attacker must persuade a user to open a specially crafted Excel (XLS)
document.

Likely attack vectors include sending the file as an e-mail attachment
or linking to the file on a website. By default, systems with Office
2000 installed will open Office documents, including Excel spreadsheet
files, from websites without prompting the user. This allows attackers
to exploit this vulnerability without user interaction. Later versions
of Office do not open these documents automatically unless the user has
chosen this behavior.

Using the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool for Office 2000 can
prevent Office files from opening automatically from web sites. Use of
this tool is highly recommended for users still using Office 2000.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability with Office
2000 SP3 fully patched as of July 2008.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any effective workaround for this
issue, since the vulnerability exists in the core component of Excel.

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE
