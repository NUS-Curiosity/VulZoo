Synopsis
========

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been discovered in Imlib2.

Background
==========

Imlib2 is replacement library from the Enlightenment project for
libraries like libXpm.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package            /  Vulnerable  /                    Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  media-libs/imlib2     < 1.4.2-r1                      >= 1.4.2-r1

Description
===========

Julien Danjou reported a pointer arithmetic error and a heap-based
buffer overflow within the load() function of the XPM image loader.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to process a specially crafted
XPM image, possibly resulting in the remote execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application, or a Denial of
Service.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Imlib2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/imlib2-1.4.2-r1"
