You know, the discourse on this list singiularly manifests the problems in it security these days.

I have remained subscribed for a couple of years as I thought there was occasaional snippets of useful informatiion, .

There obviously is no reason to continue here.  

This list has devolved to an argument between nt whateber and urleet.

I cannot remember something important was broached on this list'.

If security is important, how do we allow it to be so trivialized by the comments on this forum, and how do we get our budgets through in such a harsh econo$y?

If only you knew t34ch_m3_h0w_t0_h4ck is a Yahoo! employee and I was
making fun of it while trying to get intelligence on folks from that
forum.

We used to collect intelligence together and information share about hackers.

You can contact t34ch_m3_h0w_t0_h4ck here: http://metal.hurlant.com/blog/

Or email him here: henri_torgemane@...oo.com

Or his corporate email at henrit@...oo-inc.com if you don't believe me.

I have never told a lie...

And the folks who are subscribed to "funsec" have been lured in by Gadi Evron.

Look's like the intelligence services have got all their bases covered.

Likewise, you've all been lured into Full-disclosure and Bugtraq, but
what's *really* going on?

Take it easy,

When we look what you say in december 2008, and the look at your posts on
that forum in 2004, it's impossible to believe one second that it's not you.

How does that follow from your experience here, given that you claim to
be a blogger rather than an actual serious researcher?

(And before you say "but I *am* a researcher", keep in mind that many on
the list will immediately counter "researching what?")

Kevin is a good security researcher, but you n3td3v you are only a good
trouble researcher.
Let us see one poc, some code, something innovating come on, we're waiting
to see this since 6 years.
You think you know something about security because you feel safe behind
your keyboard you fucking scary retarded.

Real researchers who should be taken seriously aren't taken seriously anymore.

I'm leaving full-disclosure because of the abuse.

It's just turned into flames to spin people up, I don't get a chance
to talk about security or my skill set.

It's abuse after abuse after abuse.

Sorry, I can't take it anymore.
