Synopsis
========

Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in PowerDNS, possibly leading
to a Denial of Service and easing cache poisoning attacks.

Background
==========

The PowerDNS Nameserver is an authoritative-only nameserver which uses
a flexible backend architecture.

Affected packages
=================

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
       Package       /  Vulnerable  /                         Unaffected
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
    1  net-dns/pdns     < 2.9.21.2                           >= 2.9.21.2

Description
===========

Daniel Drown reported an error when receiving a HINFO CH query
(CVE-2008-5277). Brian J. Dowling of Simplicity Communications
discovered a previously unknown security implication of the PowerDNS
behavior to not respond to certain queries it considers malformed
(CVE-2008-3337).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could send specially crafted queries to cause a
Denial of Service. The second vulnerability in itself does not pose a
security risk to PowerDNS Nameserver. However, not answering a query
for an invalid DNS record within a valid domain allows for a larger
spoofing window on third-party nameservers for domains being hosted by
PowerDNS Nameserver itself.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All PowerDNS users should upgrade to the latest version:

      # emerge --sync
      # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-dns/pdns-2.9.21.2"
