Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in lighttpd may lead to information disclosure
or a Denial of Service.

Background
==========

lighttpd is a lightweight high-performance web server.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package               /  Vulnerable  /                 Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  www-servers/lighttpd      < 1.4.20                      >= 1.4.20

Description
===========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in lighttpd:

* Qhy reported a memory leak in the http_request_parse() function in
  request.c (CVE-2008-4298).

* Gaetan Bisson reported that URIs are not decoded before applying
  url.redirect and url.rewrite rules (CVE-2008-4359).

* Anders1 reported that mod_userdir performs case-sensitive
  comparisons on filename components in configuration options, which is
  insufficient when case-insensitive filesystems are used
  (CVE-2008-4360).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause a Denial
of Service, to bypass intended access restrictions, to obtain sensitive
information, or to possibly modify data.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All lighttpd users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-servers/lighttpd-1.4.20"
