Synopsis
========

libxslt is affected by a heap-based buffer overflow, possibly leading
to the execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

libxslt is the XSLT C library developed for the GNOME project. XSLT is
an XML language to define transformations for XML.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package           /   Vulnerable   /                   Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  dev-libs/libxslt      < 1.1.24-r1                    >= 1.1.24-r1
                                                               < 1.1.8

Description
===========

Chris Evans (Google Security) reported that the libexslt library that
is part of libxslt is affected by a heap-based buffer overflow in the
RC4 encryption/decryption functions.

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to process an XML file using a
specially crafted XSLT stylesheet in an application linked against
libxslt, possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the application.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All libxslt users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libxslt-1.1.24-r1"

==========
