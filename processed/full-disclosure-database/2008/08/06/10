Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities in Net-SNMP allow for authentication bypass in
snmpd and execution of arbitrary code in Perl applications using
Net-SMNP.

Background
==========

Net-SNMP is a collection of tools for generating and retrieving SNMP
data. The SNMPv3 protocol uses a keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code
(HMAC) to verify data integrity and authenticity of SNMP messages.

Affected packages
=================

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Package                /  Vulnerable  /                Unaffected
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  net-analyzer/net-snmp      < 5.4.1.1                   >= 5.4.1.1

Description
===========

Wes Hardaker reported that the SNMPv3 HMAC verification relies on the
client to specify the HMAC length (CVE-2008-0960). John Kortink
reported a buffer overflow in the Perl bindings of Net-SNMP when
processing the OCTETSTRING in an attribute value pair (AVP) received by
an SNMP agent (CVE-2008-2292).

Impact
======

An attacker could send SNMPv3 packets to an instance of snmpd providing
a valid user name and an HMAC length value of 1, and easily conduct
brute-force attacks to bypass SNMP authentication. An attacker could
further entice a user to connect to a malicious SNMP agent with an SNMP
client using the Perl bindings, possibly resulting in the execution of
arbitrary code.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Net-SNMP users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-analyzer/net-snmp-5.4.1.1"
