Synopsis
========

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Mozilla Firefox,
Thunderbird, SeaMonkey and XULRunner, some of which may allow
user-assisted execution of arbitrary code.

Background
==========

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird
an open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The
SeaMonkey project is a community effort to deliver production-quality
releases of code derived from the application formerly known as the
'Mozilla Application Suite'. XULRunner is a Mozilla runtime package
that can be used to bootstrap XUL+XPCOM applications like Firefox and
Thunderbird.

     8 affected packages on all of their supported architectures.

Description
===========

The following vulnerabilities were reported in all mentioned Mozilla
products:

* TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative reported that an incorrect
  integer data type is used as a CSS object reference counter, leading
  to a counter overflow and a free() of in-use memory (CVE-2008-2785).

* Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman and Gary Kwong reported crashes in the
  JavaScript engine, possibly triggering memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-2799).

* Devon Hubbard, Jesse Ruderman, and Martijn Wargers reported crashes
  in the layout engine, possibly triggering memory corruption
  (CVE-2008-2798).

* moz_bug_r_a4 reported that XUL documents that include a script from
  a chrome: URI that points to a fastload file would be executed with
  the privileges specified in the file (CVE-2008-2802).

* moz_bug_r_a4 reported that the mozIJSSubScriptLoader.LoadScript()
  function only apply XPCNativeWrappers to scripts loaded from standard
  "chrome:" URIs, which could be the case in third-party add-ons
  (CVE-2008-2803).

* Astabis reported a crash in the block reflow implementation related
  to large images (CVE-2008-2811).

* John G. Myers, Frank Benkstein and Nils Toedtmann reported a
  weakness in the trust model used by Mozilla, that when a user accepts
  an SSL server certificate on the basis of the CN domain name in the
  DN field, the certificate is also regarded as accepted for all domain
  names in subjectAltName:dNSName fields (CVE-2008-2809).

The following vulnerabilities were reported in Firefox, SeaMonkey and
XULRunner:

* moz_bug_r_a4 reported that the Same Origin Policy is not properly
  enforced on JavaScript (CVE-2008-2800).

* Collin Jackson and Adam Barth reported that JAR signing is not
  properly implemented, allowing injection of JavaScript into documents
  within a JAR archive (CVE-2008-2801).

* Opera Software reported an error allowing for arbitrary local file
  upload (CVE-2008-2805).

* Daniel Glazman reported that an invalid .properties file for an
  add-on might lead to the usage of uninitialized memory
  (CVE-2008-2807).

* Masahiro Yamada reported that HTML in "file://" URLs in directory
  listings is not properly escaped (CVE-2008-2808).

* Geoff reported that the context of Windows Internet shortcut files
  is not correctly identified (CVE-2008-2810).

* The crash vulnerability (CVE-2008-1380) that was previously
  announced in GLSA 200805-18 is now also also resolved in Seamonkey
  binary ebuilds.

The following vulnerability was reported in Firefox only:

* Billy Rios reported that the Pipe character in a command-line URI
  is identified as a request to open multiple tabs, allowing to open
  "chrome" and "file" URIs (CVE-2008-2933).

Impact
======

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email that will trigger one of the vulnerabilities, possibly
leading to the execution of arbitrary code or a Denial of Service. It
is also possible for an attacker to trick a user to upload arbitrary
files or to accept an invalid certificate for a spoofed web site, to
read uninitialized memory, to violate Same Origin Policy, or to conduct
Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

Workaround
==========

There is no known workaround at this time.

Resolution
==========

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-2.0.0.16"

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask -1 -v ">=www-client/mozilla-firefox-bin-2.0.0.16"

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask -1 -v ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-2.0.0.16"

All Mozilla Thunderbird binary users should upgrade to the latest
version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge -a -1 -v ">=mail-client/mozilla-thunderbird-bin-2.0.0.16"

All Seamonkey users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/seamonkey-1.1.11"

All Seamonkey binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=www-client/seamonkey-bin-1.1.11"

All XULRunner users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/xulrunner-1.8.1.16"

All XULRunner binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

    # emerge --sync
    # emerge --ask --oneshot -v ">=net-libs/xulrunner-bin-1.8.1.16"
