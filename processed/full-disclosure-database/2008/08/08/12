This affects any web site and service provider of various natures. It's 
not exclusive for OpenID nor for any other protocol / standard / 
service! It may affect an OpenID provider if it uses a compromised key 
in combination with unpatched DNS servers. I don't understand why OpenID 
is singled out, since it can potentially affect any web site including 
Google's various services (if Google would have used Debian systems to 
create their private keys).
