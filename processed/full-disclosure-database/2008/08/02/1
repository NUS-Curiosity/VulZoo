Subject: iDefense Security Advisory 08.01.08: Ingres
 Database for Linux verifydb Insecure File Permissions Modification
 Vulnerability

iDefense Security Advisory 08.01.08
http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/
Aug 01, 2008

I. BACKGROUND

Ingres Database is a database server used in several Computer
Associates' products. For example, CA Directory Service uses the Ingres
Database server. More information can be found on the vendor's website
at the following URL.

http://ingres.com/downloads/prod-cert-download.php

II. DESCRIPTION

Local exploitation of a file permissions modification vulnerability in
the "verifydb" utility, as included with Ingres Database 2006 Release 2
for Linux, allows attackers to modify the permissions of files owned by
the Ingres database user.

The vulnerability exists within the "verifydb" utility included with
Ingres. It is used to cleanup unneeded files created in the database
directory. This program has the set-uid bit set, and is owned by the
"ingres" user.

The "verifydb" program improperly changes the permissions on files. The
program first creates a file called "iivdb.log" in the current
directory, and then makes it world writable. By creating a symbolic
link to a file owned by the "ingres" user, an attacker can gain write
access to the target file.

III. ANALYSIS

Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite
arbitrary files owned by the "ingres" user. By itself, this
vulnerability does not have very serious consequences. However, when
combined with the library loading vulnerability, it allows an attacker
to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

IV. DETECTION

iDefense has confirmed the existence of this vulnerability in Ingres
2006 Enterprise Edition Release 2 for Linux x86 (32-bit). Other
versions may also be affected.

V. WORKAROUND

iDefense is currently unaware of any workaround for this issue.
