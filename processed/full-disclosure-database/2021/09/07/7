Subject: [FD] Dahua CVE-2021-33044, CVE-2021-33045

Greetings,

Two independent authentication bypass has been found in Dahua (and their OEMs) devices.
Due to the very high potential of another "Dahua mass hack", I will keep Full Disclosure details until October 6, 2021.
Highly recommend upgrading the firmware until then.

Dahua advisory: https://www.dahuasecurity.com/support/cybersecurity/details/957

Have a nice day,
