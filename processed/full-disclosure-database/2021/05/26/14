KL-001-2021-004: CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller Hard-coded Web Application Administrator Password

Title: CommScope Ruckus IoT Controller Hard-coded Web Application Administrator Password
Advisory ID: KL-001-2021-004
Publication Date: 2021.05.26
Publication URL: https://korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2021-004.txt


1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: CommScope
     Affected Product: Ruckus IoT Controller
     Affected Version: 1.7.1.0 and earlier
     Platform: Linux
     CWE Classification: CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password
     CVE ID: CVE-2021-33219


2. Vulnerability Description

     An undocumented, administrative-level, hard coded web
     application account exists in the IoT Controller OVA which
     cannot be changed by the customer.


3. Technical Description

     Ruckus vRIoT server software is available from the software
     library at: https://support.ruckuswireless.com/software/

     Once the OVA is imported into VirtualBox, a VMDK file is
     created. The VMDK file can be mounted and the directory
     structure and its contents can be perused. The virtual appliance
     contains two web application accounts with passwords stored
     in clear text on the file system. The two accounts are 'admin'
     and 'nplus1user'. The 'admin' account is documented in vendor
     documentation, but the 'nplus1user' account is undocumented.

     The password for 'admin' is documented and can be changed
     by the user. The password for the 'nplus1user' account
     is 'nplus1user'. Both accounts are administrative-level
     accounts. The virtual appliance does not appear to offer a
     mechanism for changing the default password from the vendor
     for the 'nplus1user' account.


4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     The vendor has released an updated firmware (1.8.0.0) which
     remediates the described vulnerability. Firmware and release
     notes are available at:
