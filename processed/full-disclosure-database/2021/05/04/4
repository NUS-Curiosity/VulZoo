Description:
============
An issue was discovered on Shenzhen Skyworth

A long Text to the IpAddr function allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (segmentation fault) or achieve unauthenticated remote
code execution because of control of registers.


Additional Information
========================
The value of IpAddr under /cgi-bin/app-staticIP.asp function is not
getting sanitized,so passing too much junk data to the IpAddr parameter
triggers to the SIGSEGV segmentation fault in device, post research it
was possible to control the registers.A Successful exploitation could
leads to unauthenticated remote code execution on device.


[Affected Component]
IpAddr function on page /cgi-bin/app-staticIP.asp inside the boa web
server implementation.

------------------------------------------
[Attack Type]
Remote
------------------------------------------
[Impact Code execution]
true
------------------------------------------
[Impact Denial of Service]
true

------------------------------------------
[Attack Vectors]
Remote code execution by running the poc.py against the target ip address.

[Vulnerability Type]
====================
Buffer Overflow,Exec

How to Reproduce: (POC):
========================
