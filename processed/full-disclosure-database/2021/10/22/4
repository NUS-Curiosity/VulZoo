## Vulnerability Details

CVE-2021-27597: An improper input validation for a memory function in
`GwCheckReceivedSapParams()` exists in SAP RFC Gateway service. The source
pointer is calculated partially with attacker controlled inputs. When this
`GW_REQ*` pointer’s is used again in `GwSearchConn()`, to get another
offset, it
leads to unattended behavior or crash.

CVE-2021-27633: A memory corruption vulnerability exists for `ThCPIC()` in
Disp+work binary through the SAP RFC Gateway service. An attacker can craft
a
malicious RFC packet to reach a particular part of function `ThrtHdlAppc()`,
where inputs, after a few modifications, are sent to disp+work with
`ThSAPCMSEND()`. Leading it to crash in `ThCPIC()`.

CVE-2021-27634: A memory corruption vulnerability exists for
`ThCpicDtCreate()`
in Disp+work binary through the SAP RFC Gateway service. In normal workload,
RFC requests received by the gwrd are forwarded to a work process type DIA
to
perform an ABAP task. These requests are stored in `pendingRequests` part in
memory. An attacker can craft a valid RFC packet and force the service to
store
malicious entry in `pendingRequests` aera. Leading the disp+work to crash.
