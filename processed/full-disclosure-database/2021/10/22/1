## Affected Components Description

The SAP dispatcher service is part of SAP Kernel. Mandatory, it manage,
gather
and collect the requests from end users then forward them to work process.
Without SAP dispatcher service, the SAP system is not able to process any
users
requests.


## Vulnerability Details

CVE-2021-27607 : A NULL pointer dereference exist in `ThSncIn(REQUEST_BUF**,
unsigned char)`, where `_Z10DpCaGetPtri` tries to read a part of input
controlled by an attacker, then return 0x0 instead of a pointer to normal
value
if the input is 0xffffffff.

CVE-2021-27628 : A memory corruption vulnerability exists for
`DpRTmPrepareReq(DP_SESSION_INFO)` in Disp+work binary through the SAP
Dispatcher service. If an attacker crafts a valid SAP Dispatcher packet,
with
valid header, but with a total packet size smaller than normal, the
subtraction
operation results in a negative value. Also if this negative value is
anticipated and put in the same packet at a particular offset, the check
operation that compares the two values will pass, and this value is used as
size
during the next operation.


## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 3021197 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.
