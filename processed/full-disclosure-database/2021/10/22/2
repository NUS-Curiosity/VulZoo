## Affected Components Description

The ESP framework is a framework used inside SAP JAVA NetWeaver. Due to
being
part of this foundational layer, every SAP product based on JAVA NetWeaver
will
be vulnerable to this attack. This includes: SAP SolMan, SAP LaMa, SAP CRM,
just to mention a few.


## Vulnerability Details

The Communication Profiles functionality provided within SAP JAVA

compromise
the integrity (by reading files of the OS) and the availability (by causing
process
to crash).
