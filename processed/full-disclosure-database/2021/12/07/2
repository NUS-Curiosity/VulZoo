Introduction: 
An issue was discovered in /goform/login_process in RLM 14.2. When an attacker attempts to login, the response if an username is valid includes "Login Failed", but does not include this string if the username is invalid. This allows an attacker to enumerate valid users.

Vulnerability: 
This vulnerability is triggered upon failed authentication, if an attacker supplies an invalid user with an invalid password no error message is given however if an attacker supplies the application with a valid user with an invalid password an error message is displayed informing the user "Login Failed". The difference in response can be abused in order to allow an attacker to enumerate valid users.
 
Recommendation:
We recommend displaying generic error messages upon failed authentication to mitigate the possibility of an attacker enumerating validÂ users.
