Introduction:
As the session cookies are short and simple, an attacker can hijack any existing sessions by bruteforcing the 4 hex-character session cookie on the Windows version (the Linux version appears to have 8 characters). An attacker can obtain the static part of the cookie (cookie name) by first making a request to any page on the application (e.g.,/goforms/menu) and saving the name of the cookie sent with the response.
The attacker can then use the name of the cookie and try to request that same page, setting a random value for the cookie. If any user has an active session, the page should return with the authorized content, when a valid cookie value is hit.

Vulnerability:
Due to the session cookies being rather simple and predictable, a single session, can be brute forced in less than 3 minutes, on a laptop, and can therefore be considered very insecure.

Recommendation:
It is recommended to follow industry standards and use secure randomized complex session cookies which expire when not in use or the user de-authenticates.
