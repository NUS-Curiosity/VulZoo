Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends updating to the latest version of IBM Sterling B2B
Integrator.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is highly
advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2021-20562)
A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability has been identified across
multiple functions in the mailbox component of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator,
which can be exploited under the specific condition of a victim's session.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2021-20562)
The "securetoken" parameter of the following scripts is affected by the
reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability:
/mailbox/jsp/MBIList.jsp
/mailbox/jsp/MBISearch.jsp
/mailbox/jsp/MBISend.jsp

The exploitation is successful if the "SCI_DLSSO" cookie is valid, and the
"JSESSIONID" cookie of the mailbox is invalid or does not exist. One of the
possible scenarios to meet this condition is proceeding to the following steps:

1. Log in to the dashboard via https://<host>/dashboard/Login to obtain an
"SCI_DLSSO" cookie.

2. Visit the mailbox web page via https://<host>/mailbox, which gets logged
in automatically since the web browser sends the "SCI_DLSSO" cookie from the
step 1 to obtain a "JSESSIONID" cookie of the mailbox (Path=/mailbox/).

3. Log out of the dashboard via https://<host>/dashboard/Logout
The server appears to invalidate both "SCI_DLSSO" cookie in the step 1 and
mailbox's "JSESSIONID" cookie in the step 2.

4. Log in to the dashboard via https://<host>/dashboard/Login again to obtain
a new "SCI_DLSSO" cookie.

5. Visit one of the following attacker-prepared URLs, where the web browser
uses the mailbox's "JSESSIONID" cookie in the step 2 and the "SCI_DLSSO"
cookie in the step 4, as follows:

https://<host>/mailbox/jsp/MBIList.jsp?securetoken=%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(location.origin);%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3E
https://<host>/mailbox/jsp/MBISearch.jsp?securetoken=%27%22)%3C/a%3E%3Csvg/onload%3dalert(location.origin)%3E
https://<host>/mailbox/jsp/MBISend.jsp?securetoken=%27)%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(location.origin)%3E
