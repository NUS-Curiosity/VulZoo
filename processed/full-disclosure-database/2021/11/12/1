Dear Full Disclosure Team,

------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Title:* SQL injection vulnerability in Talariax sendQuick Alertplus server
admin version 4.3

*CVE Reference:* **RESERVED** CVE-2021-26795
*Product:* Talariax sendQuick Alertplus server admin
*Vendor:* TalariaX Pte Ltd
*Vulnerable version: *Talariax sendQuick Alertplus Server Admin version 4.3
Patch no 8HF8 and below.
*Fixed version: *Patch no 8HF11
*Impact: *High
*Vulnerability Type:* SQL Injection (CWE-89)
*Vendor notification (and approval for disclosure):* 2021-Oct-05
*Public Disclosure:* 2021-Oct-06
*Discoverer: *Jerry Toh (t.ghimhong@...il.com), Edmund Ong (

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Vulnerability details: *

SQL Injection in the web interface of Talariax sendQuick Alertplus server
admin allows an authenticated user to perform error-based SQL injection via
unsanitized form fields.

The affected URL is found in the Roster Management function:
/appliance/shiftmgn.php

The attached screenshots (see evidence*.jpeg) shows that:
(1) Vulnerability was discovered showing that there is an error message
which states that the SQL Syntax error after a single quotation mark was
appended upon the form submission causing an error message which is thrown
from the database
(2) Finding was subsequently verified as fixed after input validation was
implemented in the fields.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Proof of concept:*

The following input fields were found to be vulnerable to SQL injection:
Navigate to "Roster Management" > Select Edit Roster > Day Selected > Input
fields "Roster Time". (see evidence-2.jpeg). The screenshot above shows
that there is an error message which states that the SQL Syntax error,
after a single quotation mark ('), is being appended upon the form
submission.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Remediation:*

Although the patch (Patch no 8HF11) was tested to have fixed this, it is
still recommended to use the latest product version/patches. Please
approach the vendor for the latest product patches.
