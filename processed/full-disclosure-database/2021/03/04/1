         CVE Name       CVE-2019-15297                                        

      Description     When Asterisk sends a re-invite initiating T.38 faxing  
                      and the endpoint responds with a m=image line and zero  
                      port, a crash will occur in Asterisk. This is a         
                      reoccurrence of AST-2019-004.                           
    Modules Affected  res_pjsip_t38.c                                         

    Resolution  If T.38 faxing is not required then setting ���t38_udptl��� on    
                the endpoint to ���no��� disables this functionality. This        
                option is ���no��� by default.                                    
                                                                              
                If T.38 faxing is required, then Asterisk should be upgraded  
                to a fixed version.
