- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 2975189


## Affected Components Description

SAP Hybris is an ecommerce platform that is used to address a family
of products involving
Customer Experience and Management. The "medias" module is responsible
for providing users a
secure way to upload and access files in the system.


## Vulnerability Details

When a file is uploaded into Hybris using the "medias" module, part of
the destination path is
generated using user-provided information and some other static
context data kept by Hybris.
The user-controlled part is the only one that changes among uploaded
files and therefore it's
possible to sequentially craft download-links (bruteforcing) with the
goal of accessing prior
uploaded files. Among these files it is possible to find critical ones such as
those inside the 'impex' directory.


## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 2975189 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded
fromhttps://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2975189.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
