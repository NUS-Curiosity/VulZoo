# Onapsis Security Advisory 2021-0013: [CVE-2020-26829] - Missing
Authentication Check In SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA P2P Cluster
communication


## Impact on Business

A malicious unauthenticated user could abuse the lack of authentication
check on SAP Java P2P cluster communication, in order to connect to the
respective TCP ports and perform different privileged actions, such as:

- Installing new trusted SSO providers
- Changing database connection parameters
- Gaining access to configuration information


## Advisory Information

- Public Release Date: 06/14/2021
- Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2021-0013
- Researcher(s): Ignacio D. Favro


## Vulnerability Information

- Vendor: SAP
- Affected Components: SAP Netweaver JAVA version 7.10 - 7.50

  (Check SAP Note <XXX> for detailed information on affected releases)

- Vulnerability Class: [CWE-306] Missing Authentication for Critical Function
- CVSS v3 score: 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- Risk Level: Critical
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2020-26829
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 2974774


## Affected Components Description

SAP Netweaver JAVA version 7.10 - 7.50

(Check SAP Note #2974774 for detailed information on affected releases)


## Vulnerability Details

The Cluster Manager introduced in SAP AS Java since 7.10, listens by
default on all interfaces.
The TCP port where the CM listens is defined, as several SAP products,
by a port pattern. In
this case the following structure defined the port:
**50000+100*<instance_number>+20+<node>*5**,
Where <instance_numbers> refers to the JAVA instance number of the
system and <node> the node
number within the custer.

Due to several missing authentication checks, a threat actor that is
able to reach the Cluster
Manager TCP port, could execute highly privileged actions allowing
them to gain SAP system
administrator access or perform denial of service without
authentication among others.


## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 2974774 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded
fromhttps://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2974774.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
