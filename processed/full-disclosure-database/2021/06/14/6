# Onapsis Security Advisory 2021-0010: File exfiltration and DoS in
SolMan End-User Experience Monitoring


## Impact on Business

The End-User Experience Monitoring (EEM) application, part of the SAP
Solution Manager, is vulnerable to path traversal. As a consequence, an
unauthorized attacker would be able to read sensitive OS files and affect
the availability of the EEM robots connected to the SolMan.


## Advisory Information

- Public Release Date: 06/14/2021
- Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2021-0010
- Researchers: Gonzalo Roisman, Pablo Artuso


## Vulnerability Information

- Vendor: SAP
- Affected Components:
  - SAP Solution Manager 7.2

  (Check SAP Note #2983204 for detailed information on affected releases)

- Vulnerability Class: [CWE-23] Relative Path Traversal
- CVSS v3 score: 8.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L)
- Risk Level: High
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2020-26837
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE #2983204


## Affected Components Description

SAP SolMan 7.2 introduces a bunch of web services which run on top of
the SAP Java
NetWeaver stack. The affected versions have a vulnerable web service exposed.
Affected components:
* Solman 7.20
* Solman Java Stack NW 7.5
* LM-SERVICE: 1000.7.20.9.14.20200731160700

(Check SAP Note #2983204 for detailed information on affected releases)


## Vulnerability Details

The main objective of the End-user Enterprise Monitoring (EEM) app is
to upload scripts
which will mimic user actions in order to be able to automatically perform
different kinds of tests.

In order to develop and upload the aforementioned scripts, a
proprietary language has to be used.

The lack of sanitization in a specific functionality provided by this
proprietary language,
allows a malicious user to perform path traversal attacks. Due to
these scripts being executed
by the EEM robots (by default, SMD Agents), the attacker could
exfiltrate files containing
sensitive information from the SMDAgents. Furthermore, attacks which
affect the availability
of some services from the SMDAgents, could be carried out by
exploiting this same vulnerability.


## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note #2983204 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded
fromhttps://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2983204.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
