Business recommendation:
------------------------
SEC Consult recommends upgrading to the latest available version which patches
the security issues.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is advised,
as the software may be affected from further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected cross-site scripting
The process template function with the collection settings allows uploading of
a zip file, from which the name of the template is taken and returned to the
browser. This variable is not sanitized, leading to a reflected cross-site
scripting vulnerability.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected cross-site scripting
An authenticated user with privileges to upload project files can access the
Collection Settings of one project. Under the Process function, it is possible
to upload a process template in form of a zip file, which can be obtained 
by
downloading an existing template. According to the template structure, the
ProcessTemplate.xml file should contain a name, in which the XSS payload is
injected as below:

```
<ProcessTemplate>
  <metadata>
    <name>XSS here: &lt;img src=x onerror=alert(document.URL)&gt;</name>
    <description>This template is flexible and will work great</description>
    <version type="aa12a345-00a0-1f11-ba00-b12345b12345" major="1" minor="0" />
    <plugins>
```

Soon after the upload, a message is returned to the user, stating the process
template has been renamed to the malicious one with the XSS payload. At this
point, the injected JavaScript will get executed, showing a pop-up window 
with
the URL in this case.

In reality, an attacker might send a malicious zip file to administrators 
and
trick them into uploading it, thus achieving to compromise their account.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested, which was the most recent one at the
time of the test:
