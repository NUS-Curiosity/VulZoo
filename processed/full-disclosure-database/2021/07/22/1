         CVE Name        CVE-2021-31878                                       

      Description     When Asterisk receives a re-INVITE without SDP after    
                      having sent a BYE request a crash will occur. This      
                      occurs due to the Asterisk channel no longer being      
                      present while code assumes it is.                       
    Modules Affected  res_pjsip_session.c                                     

    Resolution  Upgrade to one of the fixed versions of Asterisk or apply     
                the appropriate patch.
