          CVE Name        CVE-2021-32558                                      

      Description     If the IAX2 channel driver receives a packet that       
                      contains an unsupported  media format  it can cause a   
                      crash to occur in Asterisk.                             
    Modules Affected  chan_iax2.c                                             

    Resolution  Checks are now in place that make it so packets containing    
                unsupported media formats are ignored/dropped in the IAX2     
                channel driver. This ensures Asterisk no longer crashes.
