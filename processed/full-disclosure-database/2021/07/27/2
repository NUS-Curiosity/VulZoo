Missing Authentication for Ehcache RMI - CVE-2020-36239

Severity:
Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical, according
to the scale published in our Atlassian severity levels. The scale allows us to
rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.
This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT
environment.


Description:
Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, Jira Software Data Center, and Jira
Service Management Data Center exposed a Ehcache RMI network service which
attackers, who can connect to the service, on port 40001 and potentially
40011[0][1][2], could execute arbitrary code of their choice in Jira through
deserialization due to a missing authentication vulnerability. While Atlassian
strongly suggests restricting access to the Ehcache ports to only Data Center
instances, fixed versions of Jira will now require a shared secret in order to
allow access to the Ehcache service.

[0] In Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and Jira Software Data Center
versions prior to 7.13.1, the Ehcache object port can be randomly allocated.

[1] In Jira Service Management Data Center versions prior to 3.16.1, the
Ehcache
object port can be randomly allocated.

[2] The default Ehcache port is 40001 but it can be configured to be on a
different port, see
https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/installing-jira-data-center-938846870.html#InstallingJiraDataCenter-parametersCluster.propertiesfileparameters
for more details.
