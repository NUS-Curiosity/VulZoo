Amazon kindle for windows suffers from a DLL hijacking issue.

Mitre has issued CVE-2017-6189 for this issue.

The issue is vendor confirmed and Kindle 1.19 fixes this issue.


Proof of concept/demonstration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Create a malicious dll file and save it in your "Downloads" directory.

2. Download "Kindle Setup" and save it in your "Downloads" directory.

3. Execute "Kindle Setup" from your "Downloads" directory.

4. Malicious dll file gets executed.

Thanks.
