Subject: [FD] CVE-2017-6061 - SAP BusinessObjects XSS

Hi list,

We have found a Cross-site scripting vulnerability in SAP BusinessObjects Financial Consolidation.

[Description]
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the help component of SAP
BusinessObjects Financial Consolidation 10.0.0.1933 allows remote
attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a GET request.

------------------------------------------

[Additional Information]
The help pages of SAP BusinessObjects Financial Consolidation is
vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The help
pages are build out of multiple iframes. The frameset.htm can be
requested with JavaScript code as part of the parameters. The
parameters are written using JavaScript into the "src" attribute of an
"iframe" tag. The JavaScript code reads the URL that is present in the
browser and does basic filtering based on regular expressions to
verify whether a URI is included in the argument. However this filter
can be bypassed.
