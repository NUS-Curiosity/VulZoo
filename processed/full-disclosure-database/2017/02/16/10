2. Overview

Plone is an open source CMS written in python. In version 5.0.5, the Zope
Management Interface (ZMI) component is vulnerable to reflected XSS as it does
not properly encode double quotes.

3. Details

CVSS: Medium 4.3 AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N

Description: The search functionality of the management interface is vulnerable
to reflected XSS. As the input is echoed into an HMTL attribute, an attacker
can use double quotes to escape the current attribute and add new attributes to
enter a JavaScript context.

Proof of Concept:

obj_ids%3Atokens=%22+autofocus+onfocus%3dalert(1)%3E&obj_searchterm=&obj_mspec=
%3C&obj_mtime=&search_sub%3Aint=1&btn_submit=Find
