Vulnerability Summary
The following advisory describes a SQL injection found in QTS Helpdesk
versions 1.1.12 and earlier.

QNAP helpdesk: “Starting from QTS 4.2.2 you can use the built-in Helpdesk
app to directly submit help requests to QNAP from your NAS. To do so,
ensure your NAS can reach the Internet, open Helpdesk from the App Center,
and create a new Help Request. Helpdesk will automatically collect and
attach NAS system information and system logs to your request, and you can
provide other information such as the steps necessary to reproduce the
error, the error message and screenshots so we can identify the problem
faster.”
