Subject: [FD] Sophos Web Appliance - Block & Unblock IPs Remote Command
 Injection (CVE-2016-9553)

Critical Start security expert Russell Sanford discovered and reported two critical zero-day vulnerabilities in the Sophos Web Appliance in December of 2016. The vulnerabilities, documented under CVE-2016-9553, allow the remote compromise of the appliance's underlining Linux subsystem. The vulnerabilities have now been patched in the January 2017 4.3.1 release of the appliance line.

Here is a summary of the two vulnerabilities documented under CVE-2016-9553.

CVE ID
CVE-2016-9553<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-9553>
Vulnerability Details
The Sophos Web Appliance (version 4.2.1.3) is vulnerable to two Remote Command Injection vulnerabilities affecting its web administrative interface. These vulnerabilities occur in the MgrReport.php (/controllers/MgrReport.php) component responsible for blocking and unblocking IP addresses that are able to access appliance.
The device doesn't properly escape the information passed in the variables 'unblockip' and 'blockip' before calling the shell_exec() function which allows for system commands to be injected into the device.
The page that contains the vulnerabilities, /controllers/MgrReport.php, is accessed by a number of the machine's built in commands in administrative interface. The pages that call to the vulnerable page (passed in the '&c=' parameter) are: 'report', 'trend_volume', 'trend_suspect','top_app_ctrl', 'perf_latency', 'perf_throughput', 'users_browse_summary', 'traf_sites', 'traf_blocked', 'traf_users', 'users_virus_downloaders', 'users_pua_downloaders', 'users_highrisk', 'users_policy_violators', 'users_top_users_by_browse_time', 'users_quota', 'users_browse_time_by_user', 'users_top_users_by_category', 'users_site_visits_by_user', 'users_category_visits_by_user', 'users_monitored_search_queries', 'users_app_ctrl', 'traf_category', 'traf_download', and 'warned_sites'.
Exploitation of this vulnerability yields shell access to the remote machine under the system account 'spiderman'.
