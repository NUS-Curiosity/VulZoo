==============================================================
[CVE-2016-9962] Insecure opening of file-descriptor allows privilege
escalation

==============================================================

RunC allowed additional container processes via `runc exec` to be ptraced
by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes of the
container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these
new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes
or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the
container


Credit for this discovery goes to Aleksa Sarai from SUSE and TÃµnis Tiigi
from Docker.
