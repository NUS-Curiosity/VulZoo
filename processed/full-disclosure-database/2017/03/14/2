Subject: [FD] Aleph Research: Attacking Nexus 9 with Malicious Headphones
 (CVE-2017-0510)

Title:
Attacking Nexus 9 with Malicious Headphones

Identifier: 
CVE-2017-0510

Severity: 
Critical

Product:
Google Nexus 9

Vulnerable Version:
Android 7.1.1 N4F26Q and below

Mitigation: 
Upgrade to build N4F26T (March 2017 Security patches).

Technical Details:
Nexus 9 (running build N4F26Q and below) allows unauthorized access to the FIQ debugger via its headphones jack, which has the following impact:
1. It enables sensitive information theft, via malicious headphones, out of arbitrary processes. For example, by exploiting this vulnerability we managed to leak stack canaries and weaken ASLR. 
2. It allows the adversary access the Linux SysRq interface.
3. The attacker can reboot the device, via the FIQ debugger, into HBOOT, which may aid in further exploitation such as communicating with internal SoCs via IÂ²C. 
4. The attacker can conduct a Factory Reset.
