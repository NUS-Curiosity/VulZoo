*SAP Enterprise Portal and Clients Input Validation Flaw Lets Remote Users
Conduct Cross-Site Scripting Attacks*


*CVE Reference:* CVE-2017-10701


*Date:*  Sep 27 2017


*Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score:* 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I
:L/A:N)


*Fix Available:*  Yes  *Vendor Confirmed:*  Yes


*Version(s):*  SAP Enterprise Portal 7.50 and prior


*Description:*   A vulnerability was reported in SAP Enterprise Portal (EP)
and Clients. A remote user can conduct cross-site scripting attacks.

The software does not properly filter HTML code from user-supplied input
before displaying the input. A remote user can cause arbitrary scripting
code to be executed by the target user's browser. The code will originate
from the site running the SAP Enterprise Portal (EP) and will run in the
security context of that site. As a result, the code will be able to access
the target user's cookies (including authentication cookies), if any,
associated with the site, access data recently submitted by the target user
via web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target
user.


*Impact:*   A remote user can access the target user's cookies (including
authentication cookies), if any, associated with the site running the SAP
Enterprise Portal, access data recently submitted by the target user via
web form to the site, or take actions on the site acting as the target user.
