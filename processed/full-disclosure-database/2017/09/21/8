ESA-2017-081:  EMC ViPR SRM, EMC Storage M&R, EMC VNX M&R, EMC M&R (Watch4Net) for SAS Solution Packs Multiple Vulnerabilities 

EMC Identifier: ESA-2017-081
CVE Identifier: CVE-2017-8007, CVE-2017-8012	
Severity Rating: CVSS Base Score:  See below for individual scores. 

Affected products:  
*	EMC ViPR SRM all versions 
*	EMC Storage M&R all versions 
*	EMC VNX M&R all versions
*	EMC M&R (Watch4Net) for SAS Solution Packs all versions

Summary:  
EMC ViPR  SRM, EMC Storage M&R, EMC VNX M&R, EMC M&R (Watch4Net) for SAS Solution Packs  contain multiple vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious users to compromise the affected system. 

Details:  
*	Directory Traversal Vulnerability (CVE-2017-8007) 
Webservice Gateway used in these products is affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. Attackers with knowledge of Webservice Gateway credentials could potentially exploit this vulnerability to access unauthorized information, and modify or delete data by supplying specially crafted strings in input parameters of the web service call. 

CVSSv3 Base Score:  8.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

*	JMX Denial of Service Vulnerability (CVE-2017-8012)
The Java Management Extensions (JMX) protocol used to communicate between components in the Alerting and/or Compliance components in these products can be leveraged to create a denial of service (DoS) condition. Attackers with knowledge of JMX  agent user credentials could potentially exploit this vulnerability to create arbitrary files on the affected system and create a DoS condition by leveraging inherent JMX protocol capabilities. 

CVSSv3 Base Score:  7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

Resolution:
