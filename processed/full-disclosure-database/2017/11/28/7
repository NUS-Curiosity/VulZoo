ESA-2017-146: RSA® Authentication Agent SDK for C Error Handling Vulnerability

EMC Identifier:  ESA-2017-146
CVE Identifier:  CVE-2017-14378
 
Severity Rating: CVSS v3 Base Score: 10 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) (see note below)
 
Affected Products:
	.	RSA® Authentication Agent API 8.5 for C
	.	RSA® Authentication Agent SDK 8.6 for C
 
Summary:
A security vulnerability in RSA Authentication Agent API/SDK for C versions 8.5 and 8.6 could potentially lead to authentication bypass in certain limited implementations.
 
Details:
RSA Authentication Agent API/SDK 8.5/8.6 for C has an error handling flaw that could lead to authentication bypass in certain limited implementations. This issue will occur when the API/SDK is used in TCP asynchronous mode and return codes from the API/SDK are not handled properly by the application.
 
Implementations handling the API/SDK return codes appropriately (per coding guidelines documented in the  RSA Authentication Agent API for C Developer's Guide) are not vulnerable. Refer to KB article 000035762 (https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-85061) for information on how to inspect your implementation and additional guidance on proper handling of API/SDK return codes.
 
For clarification purposes, this issue does not impact:
	.	RSA Authentication Agent API/SDK for Java
	.	RSA Authentication Agent API for C versions prior to v8.5
	.	RSA Authentication Manager SDK and RSA SecurID® Mobile SDK.
 
Note: The CVSSv3 base score and vectors provided above are calculated based on maximum impact for vulnerable implementations. RSA recommends that all impacted customers take into account the base score (re-calculated for their own vulnerable implementation) and any temporal and/or environmental scores that may be relevant to their environment to assess their overall risk.
 
Recommendation:
The following releases contain resolution for this vulnerability:
	.	RSA Authentication Agent API 8.5.1 for C
	.	RSA Authentication Agent SDK 8.6.1 for C
 
RSA recommends all impacted customers upgrade at the earliest opportunity and/or ensure that their implementation of the API/SDK conforms to the coding guidelines documented in the RSA Authentication Agent API for C Developer's Guide. RSA Authentication Agent API/SDK downloads and documentation can be found at https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-40601#agents
 
Severity Rating:
For an explanation of Severity Ratings, refer to the Security Advisories Severity Rating  knowledge base article (https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-47147). RSA recommends all customers take into account both the base score and any relevant temporal and environmental scores which may impact the potential severity associated with particular security vulnerability.
 
EOPS Policy:
RSA has a defined End of Primary Support policy associated with all major versions. Please refer to the Product Version Life Cycle (https://community.rsa.com/docs/DOC-40387) for additional details.
