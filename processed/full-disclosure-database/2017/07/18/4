Orion Elite Hidden IP Browser Pro++ - Multiple Known Vulnerabilities
(Formerly known as: Torion Secure Anonymous Browser Pro++)
Versions affected:
7.9 (02 May 2016) and all former versions dating back to 1.0 (10 August 2015)
iPhone App Info - Description by Developer:
"#1 Onion Routing Browser that protects and hides your IP (Internet Protocol) address from
the internet for legal legitimate purposes. It is the most robust, tested and popular App on the
App Store. Is your privacy worth cutting corners? Can you be half protected? Is it worth the
risk? The world famous eVestigator.com.au, the Cyber Digital-Forensics Private Investigator,
the author and enhancer of this original open browser says "not even he could hack it" and
"I have put people behind bars just from tracing an IP before". That's straight from the Author.
If you're thinking about investigating in an inferior product, think again!"

-:: The Advisory - Detailed::-
The iPhone application reviewed is vulnerable to multiple known issues.
1. The Tor client embedded within the application is: 0.2.6.5-rc (released 18 Mar 2015)
Relevant changelogs:
- https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/ReleaseNotes?h=release-0.2.6 (https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0265-rc-released)
- Potentially Applicable CVEs:
CVE-2017-0376, CVE-2017-0375, CVE-2016-8860
2. The OpenSSL library embedded within the application is: 1.0.2a (released 19 Mar 2015)
Relevant changelogs:
- https://openssl.org/news/changelog.html
- https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt << Important security advisory
- https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt << Important security advisory
- Applicable CVEs:
CVE-2017-3731, CVE-2017-3732, CVE-2016-7055, CVE-2016-7052, CVE-2016-6304, CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2016-6303
CVE-2016-6302, CVE-2016-2182, CVE-2016-2180, CVE-2016-2177, CVE-2016-2178, CVE-2016-2179, CVE-2016-2181
CVE-2016-6306, CVE-2016-2107, CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, CVE-2016-2109, CVE-2016-2176, CVE-2016-0800
CVE-2016-0705, CVE-2016-0798, CVE-2016-0797, CVE-2016-0799, CVE-2016-0702, CVE-2016-0701, CVE-2015-3197
CVE-2015-3193, CVE-2015-3194, CVE-2015-3195, CVE-2015-1793, CVE-2015-3196
3. Known bugs from the original application, by the original developer:
- Video note: Websites using HTML5 <video> tags may leak <video>-related DNS queries and data transfer outside
of Tor. This includes YouTube, Vimeo, and any website using iOS-compatible HTML5 video. This is due to behavior
of the embedded QuickTime player and a comprehensive workaround has not yet been developed.
- JavaScript blocking: The "Active Content Blocking" feature is experimental. If ACB is turned off, JavaScript
techniques can identify what type of iOS device you are using and what version of iOS you are using, even if
User-Agent Spoofing is enabled.
- Geolocation blocking: Websites may use the HTML5 Geolocation API unless the "Active Content Blocking" feature
is set to "Block All". Users should remain vigilant for any pop-ups asking for permission to access location data.
Note: Please refer to the references further below, i.e. "Known Bugs".
4. The application also sends the following HTTP request on startup to the developers website:
http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/ip34r.asp?guid=<INSERT GUID HERE>
An example of this can be seen below:
GET /secure/ip34r.asp?guid=<INSERT GUID HERE>&new=1 HTTP/1.1
Host: www.orionbrowser.com
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-us
Connection: close
Pragma: no-cache
User-Agent: OrionBrowser/<VERSION HERE> CFNetwork/<VERSION HERE> Darwin/<VERSION HERE>
According to the developer, this is to check that the application is licensed, by sending a unique GUID over HTTP that can be tracked, every time the application is run.
5. In addition to the above, several other links are hardcoded to use HTTP:
__cstring:001B912A 00000033 C http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/ip34r.asp?guid=
__cstring:001B9443 00000028 C http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/?tk=
__cstring:001B94C5 0000003F C window.location.href='http://orionbrowser.com/secure/top.asp';
__cstring:001B9504 00000042 C window.location.href='http://orionbrowser.com/secure/bottom.asp';
__cstring:001B9546 00000040 C window.location.href='http://orionbrowser.com/secure/menu.asp';
__cstring:001B971D 00000037 C http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/bookmark.asp?title=
__cstring:001B9980 00000026 C http://www.orionbrowser.com/help.html
__cstring:001BBA84 0000001D C http://www.orionbrowser.com/
__cstring:001BBB27 00000027 C http://www.orionbrowser.com/opensource
6. Several embedded HTML files within the application, will also redirect to the developer's website over HTTP:
a.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2; URL='http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/a.html" />
about.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='http://www.orionbrowser.com/" />
bookmark.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/bookmark.asp" />
help.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure" />
startup.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure" />
status.html: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL='http://www.orionbrowser.com/secure/status.html" />
7. The current version of this iPhone app does not use "HashedControlPassword" within the TorRC file either.
-:: Proof of Concept ::-
The current version of this iPhone application appears to be broken, and has likely been broken for a few months.
When the app starts up, it expects the developer's domain to provide a specific response over plain-text HTTP. The
first request made to the developer's website is vulnerable to MITM attacks before it crashes.
-:: Solution ::-
1. The embedded OpenSSL library must be updated to the latest version.
2. The embedded Tor client within the application, must be updated to the latest secure version.
3. Users must be notified of known bugs - See references further below.
4. All connections made to the developer's website must be over HTTPS.
5. The application should NOT send a unique GUID to the developer's website when it runs.
6. The application should NOT allow the user to save bookmarks on the developer's website.
It is STRONGLY advised to uninstall this iPhone application immediately, if you have it installed on your phone.
