Product
-------------------

Nextcloud is a open source software for cloud storage service. Also,
this software are more features for synchronizing. e.g. Calendar,
contacts, tasks or RSS readers.
It is a fork from Owncloud. Currently, Owncloud is working on
backporting this vulnerability to be fixed in the next release, I
hope.                                                                                                                                                                                                           

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Description

A HTML injection vulnerability flaw in the Nextcloud and Owncloud.
Through this vulnerability an attacker could manipulate the website.
This vulnerability could affect to the logged users. An attacker could
send a malicious link (that contains the manipulated URL) to a
legitimate user that he is logged in and simulate the login screen to
stole the password (phishing), or multiple attacks more, like XSS.
Nextcloud and ownCloud use Content-Security-Policy which prevents
execution of inline JavaScript. However, as of  now prominently Internet
Explorer hasn't implemented Content-Security-Policy thus being at risk
against this reflected Cross-Site Scripting

Exist more options to attack, for example, redirect the content of an
<object> or <script> to a saved and shared items of your directory.
Also, the mimetypes are well configured and the most browsers will not
execute a javascript file that doesn't have the javascript content-type.
