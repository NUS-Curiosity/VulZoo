Subject: [FD] [KIS-2020-01] SuiteCRM <= 7.11.11 Second-Order PHP Object
 Injection Vulnerabilities

---------------------------------------------------------------------
SuiteCRM <= 7.11.11 Second-Order PHP Object Injection Vulnerabilities
---------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

https://suitecrm.com/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 7.11.11 and prior versions.


[-] Vulnerabilities Description:

1) The vulnerability exists because the 
"EmailsControllerActionGetFromFields::getEmailSignatures()” method
is using the unserialize() function with the "account_signatures” user 
preference, and such a value can be
arbitrarily manipulated by evil users through the EmailUIAjax interface. 
This can be exploited to inject
arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope, allowing an attacker 
to perform a variety of attacks,
such as executing arbitrary PHP code.

2) The vulnerability exists because the 
"EmailsControllerActionGetFromFields::handleActionGetFromFields()”
method is using the unserialize() function with the "showFolders” user 
preference, and such a value can be
arbitrarily manipulated by evil users through the EmailUIAjax interface. 
This can be exploited to inject
arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope, allowing an attacker 
to perform a variety of attacks,
such as executing arbitrary PHP code.
