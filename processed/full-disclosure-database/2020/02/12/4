Subject: [FD] [KIS-2020-04] SuiteCRM <= 7.11.11 (add_to_prospect_list)
 Broken Access Control Vulnerability

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SuiteCRM <= 7.11.11 (add_to_prospect_list) Broken Access Control 
Vulnerability
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[-] Software Link:

https://suitecrm.com/


[-] Affected Versions:

Version 7.11.11 and prior versions.


[-] Vulnerability Description:

There is a Local File Inclusion vulnerability within the 
"add_to_prospect_list" function. User input
passed through the "parent_module" and "parent_type" parameters is not 
properly validated before
being used in a call to the include() function. This can be exploited to 
include arbitrary .php
files within the webroot and potentially bypass authorization mechanisms 
(for instance, by setting
the "parent_module" parameter to "Administration" and the "parent_type" 
parameter to "expandDatabase"
or any other administrative action which does not implement ACL checks).


[-] Solution:

No official solution is currently available.
