Subject: [FD] TCMalloc viewer/dumper - TCMalloc Inspector Tool

Hi List,

Maybe you will find this interesting/useful.

Below is the TCMalloc tool that can inspect TCMalloc allocations:

https://github.com/marcinguy/tcmalloc-inspector

Here is my attempt to do the same for Chromium (Chrome) based browsers,
since they also used a tuned/adjusted TCMalloc. However without success.
Let me know if you know how to fix it.

Did this to play some more with CVE-2020-15999


Thanks,
Marcin

P.S With CVE-2020-15999 got stuck here now:
