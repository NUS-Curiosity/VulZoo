# CVE: CVE-2019-12783

1. Description

An issue was discovered in Verint Impact 360 15.1. At wfo/control/signin,
the rd parameter can accept a URL, to which users will be redirected after
a successful login. In combination with CVE-2019-12784, this may allow
attackers to compromise credentials via bruteforce even if the site is not
accessible to the attacker due to firewall rules or network configuration.

2. Mitigation

Create firewall rules that drop outbound traffic to unknown hosts with a
referrer of the Impact 360 system.
Request a patch from Verint. Verint has not patched this vulnerability to
my knowledge, despite having been made aware of it over a year ago.

3. PoC

Withheld due to possible legal threat.
