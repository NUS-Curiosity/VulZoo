Subject: [FD] RichFaces exploitation toolkit

Hi,

The RichFaces library has been vulnerable to many Java deserialization 
and EL injection vulnerabilities. This infamous library is included with 
many JSF web applications for providing advanced UI elements beyond the 
(very limited) set that is built-in with the framework. Therefore, many 
websites using JSF are vulnerable to exploitation.

Until now, the vulnerabilities had to be exploited manually. Richsploit 
is a toolkit that can exploit multiple versions of RichFaces:

RichFaces 3
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.3 	CVE-2013-2165
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.4 	CVE-2018-12533
3.1.0 ≤ 3.3.4 	CVE-2018-14667
RichFaces 4
4.0.0 ≤ 4.3.2 	CVE-2013-2165
4.0.0 ≤ 4.5.4 	CVE-2015-0279
4.5.3 ≤ 4.5.17 	CVE-2018-12532

For more information, please read our blog post at:

The tool can be downloaded from GitHub:
