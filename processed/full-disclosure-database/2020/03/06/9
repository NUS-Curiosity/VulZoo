 Creative Contact Form

# Directory Traversal in Creative Contact Form

## Overview
* Identifier: AIT-SA-20200301-01
* Target: Creative Contact Form (for Joomla)
* Vendor: Creative Solutions
* Version: 4.6.2 (before Dec 03 2019)
* CVE: CVE-2020-9364
* Accessibility: Remote
* Severity: Critical
* Author: Wolfgang Hotwagner (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology)

## Summary
[Creative Contact Form](https://creative-solutions.net/) is a responsive jQuery contact form for the Joomla content-management-system. 

## Vulnerability Description
A directory traversal vulnerability resides inside the mailer component of the Creative Contact Form for Joomla. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to receive any files from the server via e-mail.

The vulnerable code is located in "helpers/mailer.php" at line 290:
```
if(isset($_POST['creativecontactform_upload'])) {
if(is_array($_POST['creativecontactform_upload'])) {
foreach($_POST['creativecontactform_upload'] as $file) {

// echo $file.'--';
$file_path = JPATH_BASE . '/components/com_creativecontactform/views/creativeupload/files/'.$file;
$attach_files[] = $file_path;
}
}
}
```

If an attacker puts "../../../../../../../../etc/passwd" into $_POST['creativecontactform_upload'], and enables "Send me a copy", the contact-form would send him the content of /etc/passwd via email.

_Note: this vulnerability might not be exploitable in the free version of Creative Contact Form since it does not allow "Send copy to sender"._

## Vulnerable Versions
Creative Contact Form Personal/Professional/Business 4.6.2 (before Dec 3 2019)

## Impact
An unauthenticated attacker could receive any file from the server

## Mitigation
Update to the current version
