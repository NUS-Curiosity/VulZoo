Subject: [FD] CVE-2020-2771, CVE-2020-2851,
 CVE-2020-2944 - Multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle Solaris

Hello,

Please find attached 3 recent advisories for the following vulnerabilities, fixed in Oracle's Critical Patch Update (CPU) of April 2020:

CVE-2020-2771. A difficult to exploit heap-based buffer overflow in setuid root whodo and w binaries distributed with Solaris allows local users to corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code in order to escalate privileges.

CVE-2020-2851. A difficult to exploit stack-based buffer overflow in the _DtCreateDtDirs() function in the Common Desktop Environment version distributed with Oracle Solaris 10 1/13 (Update 11) and earlier may allow local users to corrupt memory and potentially execute arbitrary code in order to escalate privileges via a long X11 display name. The vulnerable function is located in the libDtSvc library and can be reached by executing the setuid program dtsession.

CVE-2020-2944. A buffer overflow in the _SanityCheck() function in the Common Desktop Environment version distributed with Oracle Solaris 10 1/13 (Update 11) and earlier allows local users to gain root privileges via a long calendar name or calendar owner passed to sdtcm_convert in a malicious calendar file.
