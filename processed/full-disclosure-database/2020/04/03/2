Subject: [FD] MicroStrategy Intelligence Server and Web 10.4 - multiple
 vulnerabilities

Hi,
early last autumn we have conducted an assessment on MicroStrategy 
Intellitence Server & Web 10.4, that brought to the discovery of six 
different vulnerabilities and recently at the registration of a total of 
five CVE(s).

CVE-2020-11450 - Information Disclosure in Axis2 Happiness Page
Microstrategy Web 10.4 and possibly above exposes JVM configuration, CPU 
architecture, installation folder and other info through the URL 
“/MicroStrategyWS/happyaxis.jsp”. An attacker could use this 
vulnerability to learn more about the environment the application is 
running in.

CVE-2020-11453 - Server-Side Request Forgery in Test Web Service
Microstrategy Web 10.4 and possibly above is vulnerable to Server-Side 
Request Forgery in the “Test Web Service” functionality exposed through 
the path “/MicroStrategyWS/”. The functionality requires no 
authentication and, while it is not possible to pass arbitrary schemes 
and parameters in the SSRF request, it is still possible to exploit it 
to conduct port scanning. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability 
to enumerate the resources allocated in the network (IP addresses and 
services exposed).

CVE-2020-11452- Server Side Request Forgery in adding external data
Microstrategy Web 10.4 and possibly above includes a functionality to 
allow users to import files or data from external resources such as URLs 
or databases in order to parse contents for dashboard creation. By 
providing an external URL under attacker control it’s possible to send 
requests to external resources or leak files from the local system using 
the “file://” stream wrapper.

CVE-2020-11451 - Remote Code Execution in Upload Visualization Plugin
The “Upload Visualization” plugin in the Microstrategy admin panel 
(version 10.4 and above) allows an administrator to upload a zip
archive containing files with arbitrary extensions and data. Access to 
admin panel could be reached through SSRF (for example via 
CVE-2020-11452).

CVE-2020-11454 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting in the Dashboard
Microstrategy Web 10.4 and possibly above is vulnerable to Stored 
Cross-Site Scripting in the “HTML Container” and “Insert Text”
functionalities in the window allowing for the creation of a new 
dashboard. In order to exploit this vulnerability an user need to have 
access to a shared dashboard or the ability to create a dashboard on the 
application.
