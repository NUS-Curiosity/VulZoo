The vulnerability is due to improper SSL policy handling by the affected software when packets are passed through the sensing interfaces of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets through a targeted system. This vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower System Software that is configured with the SSL policy feature. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc84361."
