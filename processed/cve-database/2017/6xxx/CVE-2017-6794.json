The attacker must first authenticate to the application with valid administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input at the CLI for certain commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected application and submitting a crafted CLI command for execution at the Cisco Meeting Server CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform command injection and escalate their privilege level to root. Vulnerable Products: This vulnerability exists in Cisco Meeting Server software versions prior to and including 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf53830."
