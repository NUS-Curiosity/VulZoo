The vulnerability is due to the absence of role-based access control (RBAC) for file-download requests that are sent to the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download and view any system file by using the affected software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd11628."
