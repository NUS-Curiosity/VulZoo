Supported versions that are affected are 2.2.0.3.13, 2.3.0.0 and 2.3.0.1. Easily \"exploitable\" vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Real-Time Scheduler. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Real-Time Scheduler, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Real-Time Scheduler accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Real-Time Scheduler accessible data.
