The attacker could be granted full administrator privileges. The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of authentication for accessing certain web pages using the GUI interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface of the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and perform unauthorized configuration changes or issue control commands to the affected device. This vulnerability affects Cisco Mobility Express 1800 Series Access Points running a software version prior to 8.2.110.0. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuy68219."
