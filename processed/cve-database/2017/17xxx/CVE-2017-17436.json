The website and marketing materials advertise that this communication channel is encrypted with \"Highest Level Bluetooth Encryption\" and \"Data transmissions are secure via AES256 bit encryption.\" These claims, however, are not true. Moreover, AES256 bit encryption is not supported in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) standard, so it would have to be at the application level. This lack of encryption allows an individual to learn the passcode by eavesdropping on the communications between the application and the safe."
