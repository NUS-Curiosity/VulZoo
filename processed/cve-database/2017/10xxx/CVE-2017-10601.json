The following error messages may be seen when this failure occurs: mgd: error: commit failed: (statements constraint check failed) Warning: Commit failed, activating partial configuration. Warning: Edit the router configuration to fix these errors. If the administrative changes are not made that result in such a failure, then this issue is not seen.
