The supported version that is affected is 11.1.1.9.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Service Bus. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Service Bus, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Service Bus accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Service Bus accessible data.
