During analysis, it was found that this domain was not owned by IROAD, allowing an attacker to register it and potentially intercept sensitive device traffic. If the dashcam or related services attempt to resolve this domain over the public Internet instead of locally, it could lead to data exfiltration or man-in-the-middle attacks."
