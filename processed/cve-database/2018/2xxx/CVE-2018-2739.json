Supported versions that are affected are 10.1.4.3.0, 11.1.2.3.0 and 12.2.1.3.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Access Manager. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Access Manager, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data or all Oracle Access Manager accessible data as well as unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Oracle Access Manager accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.3 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N)."
