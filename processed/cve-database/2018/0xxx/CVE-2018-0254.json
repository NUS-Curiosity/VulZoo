The vulnerability is due to incorrect counting of the percentage of dropped traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending network traffic to a targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured file action policies, and traffic that should be dropped could be allowed into the network. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf86435."
