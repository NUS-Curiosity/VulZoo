The vulnerability is due to the improper display of user-account tokens generated in the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device with a token in use by another account. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to cause a partial impact to the device's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg05206."
