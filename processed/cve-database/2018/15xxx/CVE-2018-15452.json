To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative credentials on the Windows system. The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of resources loaded by a system process at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious DLL file and placing it in a specific location on the targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to disable the targeted system's scanning services and ultimately prevent the system from being protected from further intrusion. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
