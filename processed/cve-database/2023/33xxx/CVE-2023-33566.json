This vulnerability could allow a malicious user to inject malicious ROS2 nodes into the system remotely. Once injected, these nodes could disrupt the normal operations of the system or cause other potentially harmful behavior. NOTE: this is disputed by multiple third parties who believe there was not reasonable evidence to determine the existence of a vulnerability."
