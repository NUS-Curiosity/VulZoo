Continued receipt of this specific packet will cause a sustained Denial of Service condition.\n\nOn all SRX Series and MX Series platforms, where IDP is enabled and a specific malformed SSL packet is received, the SSL detector crashes leading to an FPC core.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks SRX Series and MX Series prior to SigPack 3598.\n\nIn order to identify the current SigPack version, following command can be used:\n\nuser@junos# show security idp security-package-version"
