Unfortunately the logic introduced there\ndidn't account for the extreme case of the entire packet being split\ninto as many pieces as permitted by the protocol, yet still being\nsmaller than the area that's specially dealt with to keep all (possible)\nheaders together.  Such an unusual packet would therefore trigger a\nbuffer overrun in the driver.\n"
