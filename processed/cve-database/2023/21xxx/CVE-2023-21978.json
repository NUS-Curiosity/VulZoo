Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Application Object Library.  Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Application Object Library, attacks may significantly impact additional products (scope change). Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in  unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Application Object Library accessible data as well as  unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Application Object Library accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Oracle Application Object Library.
