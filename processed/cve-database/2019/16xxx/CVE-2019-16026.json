The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of SCTP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a man-in-the-middle position between the eNodeB and the MME and then sending a crafted SCTP message to the MME. A successful exploit would cause the MME to stop sending SCTP messages to the eNodeB, triggering a DoS condition."
