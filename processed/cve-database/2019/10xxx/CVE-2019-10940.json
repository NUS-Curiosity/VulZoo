Incorrect session validation could allow an attacker with a valid session, with low privileges, to perform firmware updates and other administrative operations on connected devices. The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system. An attacker must have access to a low privileged account in order to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system and underlying components. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known."
