It doesn't sufficiently filter output when displaying certain block descriptions created by administrators. An attacker could potentially craft a specialized description, then have an administrator execute scripting when configuring a layout, aka XSS. This issue is mitigated by the fact that the attacker would be required to have the permission to create custom blocks, which is typically an administrative task."
