The supported version that is affected is 8.0.8. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Oracle Hospitality Cruise Shipboard Property Management System executes to compromise Oracle Hospitality Cruise Shipboard Property Management System. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Hospitality Cruise Shipboard Property Management System, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of Oracle Hospitality Cruise Shipboard Property Management System as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Hospitality Cruise Shipboard Property Management System accessible data and unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Hospitality Cruise Shipboard Property Management System accessible data.
