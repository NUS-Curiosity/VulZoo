The vulnerability exists because OpenSSH mishandles the authentication process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the device via SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the configuration as an administrative user if the default credentials are not changed. There are no workarounds available; however, if client-side certificate authentication is enabled, disable it and use strong password authentication. Client-side certificate authentication is disabled by default."
