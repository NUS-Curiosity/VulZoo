The vulnerability is due to insufficient X.509 certificate validation when establishing a WSMA connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted X.509 certificate during the WSMA connection setup phase. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt confidential information on WSMA connections to the affected software. At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco IND Software releases prior to 1.7."
