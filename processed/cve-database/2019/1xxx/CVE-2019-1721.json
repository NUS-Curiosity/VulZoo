The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the XML input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) message with a crafted XML payload to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust CPU resources, resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention may be required to recover the device. This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server Releases X12.5.1 and later."
