The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link and subsequently access a specific web interface page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive browser-based information."
