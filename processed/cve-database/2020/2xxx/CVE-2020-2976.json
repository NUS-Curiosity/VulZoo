Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker having SQL Workshop privilege with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Application Express. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Application Express, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Application Express accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Application Express accessible data.
