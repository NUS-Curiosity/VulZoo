Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Access Manager. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Access Manager, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Access Manager accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle Access Manager accessible data.
