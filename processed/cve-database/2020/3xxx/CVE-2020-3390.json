The vulnerability is due to the lack of input validation of the information used to generate an SNMP trap in relation to a wireless client connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an 802.1x packet with crafted parameters during the wireless authentication setup phase of a connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, causing a DoS condition."
