The vulnerability is due to improper authorization of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a specific URI on the web-based management interface of the router, but only after any valid user has opened a specific file on the device since the last reboot. A successful exploit would allow the attacker to view sensitive information, which should be restricted."
