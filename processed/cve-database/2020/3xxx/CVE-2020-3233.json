The attacker must have valid Local Manager credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based Local Manager interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into a system settings tab. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information."
