In addition, the Elefant installer registers two\n Firebird database services which are running as \u201cNT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\u201d.\u00a0\n\nPath: C:\\Elefant1\\Firebird_2\\bin\\fbserver.exe\n\nPath: C:\\Elefant1\\Firebird_2\\bin\\fbguard.exe\n\n\nBoth service binaries are user writable. This means that a local \nattacker can rename one of the service binaries, replace the service \nexecutable with a new executable, and then restart the system. Once the \nsystem has rebooted, the new service binary is executed as \"NT \nAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\"."
