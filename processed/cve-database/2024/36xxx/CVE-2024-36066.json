CMP includes password-based MAC as one of the options for message integrity and authentication (the other option is certificate-based). RFC 4211 section 4.4 requires that password-based MAC parameters use a salt with a random value of at least 8 octets. This helps to inhibit dictionary attacks. Because the standalone CMP client originally was developed as test code, the salt was instead hardcoded and only 6 octets long."
