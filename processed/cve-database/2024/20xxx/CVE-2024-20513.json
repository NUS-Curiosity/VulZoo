An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by brute forcing valid session handlers. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the AnyConnect VPN service of an affected device to retrieve a valid session handler and, based on that handler, predict further valid session handlers. The attacker would then send a crafted HTTPS request using the brute-forced or predicted session handler to the AnyConnect VPN server of the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate targeted SSL VPN sessions, forcing remote users to initiate new VPN connections and reauthenticate."
