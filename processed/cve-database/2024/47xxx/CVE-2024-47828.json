Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces authenticated users to submit a request to a Web application against which they are currently authenticated. This vulnerability can be exploited by creating a malicious script with an arbitrary playlist ID belonging to another user. When the user submits the request, their playlist will be deleted. Any User with active sessions who are tricked into submitting a malicious request are impacted, as their playlists or other objects could be deleted without their consent."
