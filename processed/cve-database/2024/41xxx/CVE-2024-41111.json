                "value": "Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework, it can be used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing. Sliver version 1.6.0 (prerelease) is vulnerable to RCE on the teamserver by a low-privileged \"operator\" user. The RCE is as the system root user. The exploit is pretty fun as we make the Sliver server pwn itself. As described in a past issue (#65), \"there is a clear security boundary between the operator and server, an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on the server.\" An operator who exploited this vulnerability would be able to view all console logs, kick all other operators, view and modify files stored on the server, and ultimately delete the server. This issue has not yet be addressed but is expected to be resolved before the full release of version 1.6.0. Users of the 1.6.0 prerelease should avoid using Silver in production."
