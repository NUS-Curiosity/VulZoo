This candidate was originally published to handle a pre-patch vague announcement, but multiple simultaneous pre-patch announcements resulted in duplicate CVEs that could not be identified until a full patch was released. Notes: All CVE users should reference CVE-2005-4092 instead of this candidate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage."
