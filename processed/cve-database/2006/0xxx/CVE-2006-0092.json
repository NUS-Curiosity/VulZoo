Reason: this candidate was intended for one issue, but a typo caused it to be associated with a Novell/Groupwise issue.  In addition, this issue was a duplicate of a SiteSuite issue that was also assigned CVE-2006-0158.  Notes: All CVE users should consult CVE-2006-0992 and CVE-2006-0158 to determine which ID is appropriate.  All references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to prevent accidental usage."
