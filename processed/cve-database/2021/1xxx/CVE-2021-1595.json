These vulnerabilities are due to incorrect processing of certain LLDP packets at ingress time. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to continuously consume memory, which could cause the device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent)."
