This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming mDNS traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted mDNS packet to an affected device through a wireless network that is configured in FlexConnect local switching mode or through a wired network on a configured mDNS VLAN. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the access point (AP) to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition."
