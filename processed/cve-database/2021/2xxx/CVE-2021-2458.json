Supported versions that are affected are 11.1.2.2.0, 11.1.2.3.0, 12.2.1.3.0 and 12.2.1.4.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Identity Manager. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Identity Manager, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Identity Manager accessible data as well as unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Identity Manager accessible data.
