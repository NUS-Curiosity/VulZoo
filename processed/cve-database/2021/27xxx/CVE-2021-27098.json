Proper controls are in place to require that the caller presents a valid agent certificate that is already authorized to issue at least one SPIFFE ID, and the requested SPIFFE ID belongs to the same trust domain, prior to being able to trigger this vulnerability. This issue has been fixed in SPIRE versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3 and 0.12.1."
