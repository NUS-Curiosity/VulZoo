Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the \"history\" utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s <code>.bash_history</code> file. For each user, this file resides at the same location: <code>~/.bash_history</code>. Typically, this file keeps track of the user’s last 500 commands. Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out.

A learning module may categorize computing entities inside the network into assets and generate asset data to monitor the computing entities. If one or more computing entities address a flow to an address of a host that no longer exists, ghost asset data may be recorded and updated in the asset data. When a computing entity inside the network contacts an object in the dark-net, the computing entity may be recorded a potential mapper. When the computing entity tries to contact a number of objects in the dark-net, such that a computed threshold is exceeded, the computing entity is identified a malicious entity performing network reconnaissance.",

Network packets are collected (ex. tapped from a network switch) and processed to create flows that are used to map out the network to identify network assets as well as ghost assets (addresses not assigned to a device or an existing device that is temporarily disabled). Once this mapping is complete it is used to monitor the network to determine if an attacker is attempting to connect to a ghost asset. If an attacker attempts to connect to a ghost asset over a threshold (ex. contacting four ghost assets in less than seven minutes), an alert is generated.",

For example, it could detect that the system clock is being sped up in an effort to get it to execute commands that it would normally only execute at a later time, or that the hardware manufacturer of the machine is a virtualization provider.\n * Malware can attempt to determine if it is being debugged, and change its behavior accordingly.\n * For maximum fidelity, the simulated and real environments should be as similar as possible because the malware could perform differently in different environments.\n * Sometimes the malware behavior is triggered only under certain conditions (on a specific system date, after a certain time, or after it is sent a specific command) and can't be detected through a short execution in a virtual environment.\n\n## Implementations\n* [Cuckoo Sandbox](https://cuckoosandbox.org)",

The focus of such work is to determine if source code and optimized code have the same functional semantics. In this paper, we introduce the correctness-security gap, which arises when a compiler optimization preserves the functionality of but violates a security guarantee made by source code. We show with concrete code examples that several standard optimizations, which have been formally proved correct, inhabit this correctness-security gap. We analyze this gap and conclude that it arises due to techniques that model the state of the program but not the state of the underlying machine. We propose a broad research program whose goal is to identify, understand, and mitigate the impact of security errors introduced by compiler optimizations. Our proposal includes research in testing, program analysis, theorem proving, and the development of new, accurate machine models for reasoning about the impact of compiler optimizations on security.",

For example, data collected for an application can show an API call to libc at address 0x43e0 and an API call by libc at address 0xlfb47. Accordingly, two rules are generated. The first rule specifies the location type and target of the API call at address 0x43e0, as well as the return address.

Windows SmartScreen)\n* User-File combination\n\nThis may be done to prevent execution of applications which are:\n\n* an old version with known vulnerabilities\n* without a valid license, which could cause legal issues\n* in a directory that is accessible to low-privileged users, that could be accessed by a malware dropper\n* known trojan horse programs\n* too open in their permissions, possibly set to run as a user other than the originator or allowing execution when they should not be\n* a match to the hash of other known malware\n* are detected as undesirable based on a file scan runtime behavior\n\nSystem administrators will customize the rules for the given environment.\n\n#### Backend\n\nThe policy-enforcing program may work by running in kernel mode, and [intercepting] [system calls which execute a process].\n\n## Considerations\n\n* If denylisting is done by filename, filepath, or hash, these mechanisms may be a worthy first line of defense and detection, but could still be evaded by an attacker.\n* Continuous management is needed to keep the denylist up to date, whether it is based on hash, publisher, behavior, or any other digital artifact.\n* Although denylists based on attributes such as file path and virus scan could defend against some threats which they have not been explicitly coded to block, denylists may not provide protection from new, unknown, or zero day attacks.\n\n\n## Examples\nOn a Windows machine the Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy enforcement is run in the kernel and allows for restricting applications.",

The system identifies certain host processes that may attempt to utilize a hosted scripting engine. An unmanaged interface module is injected into an identified host process. The unmanaged interface module is configured to detect certain conditions indicating the likelihood that a scripting engine will be instantiated, and in response to inject a managed interface module into the host process. The managed interface module hooks into certain methods of the scripting engine to intercept commands before they are executed by the scripting engine. The managed and unmanaged interface components then communicate with a kernel-mode threat detection component to determine whether any commands should be blocked.",

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\nMany application exploits rely on an attacker specifying a location in memory, which points to data or code used by the attacker.  If the addresses are changed each time the program is run, then it becomes more difficult for the attacker to determine the location that will contain the code they wish to run.\n\nImported modules may be similarly realigned if their default memory addresses conflict with other modules, in a process known as \"rebasing.\"  Just as not all code is built for participation in ASLR, not all modules can be rebased; instead, modules must indicate whether they implement support for rebasing.  Such information to relocate the executable is typically stored in the \".reloc\" segment -- each of the addresses pointed to in this segment has its address increased by the amount of the offset.\n(An alternative method for relocation would be to add an amount to a global variable each time -- leading to less overhead in the module load, but more for each access.  Still another implementation could instead contain code to deference each changeable memory location on the fly, so that each of the references do not need to be updated.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nAs the offset for each segment is constant, it is possible to guess at the value of the address given the address of another variable.  Alternatively, memory pointers may be kept around, which contain the address of another variable.\nAnother bypass technique is known as an \"egg hunt,\" whereby the attacker searches for a rather unique piece of the data or code in memory to determine its likely address.\n\nThe program needs to store these addresses for the functions somewhere.  In Linux, the PLT contains a \"trampoline\" to these addresses.  If an attacker desires to jump to the start of an existing function, they can jump directly to the trampoline anyway, and may have the opportunity to provide their own stack frame to the function with a write to the stack. If they overwrite a saved stack pointer which is loaded back into memory, or execute a function, that changes the address of a stack pointer.\n\nIf an attacker wants to inject some data into the program, for example as a parameter to a known function that is not under ASLR or a pointer to a trampoline function in the PLT, then they can repeat the data until they exceed the range of ASLR coverage, which on 32-bit systems is accomplishable in a few seconds with a heap spray.  Microsoft's EMET and Windows 10 Exploit Guard can pre-allocate particular addresses that are commonly used in heap sprays.  However, in many products, there does not seem to be nearly a complete coverage of such addresses, which only need to be executable and in the range of the heap; 0x0c0c0c0c is such an address that is commonly used for the x86 processor architecture, as when executed it only performs a numeric operation to a register four times.",

      "d3f:definition": "The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.",
      "d3f:kb-article": "## **How it works**\nThe goal of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is to identify the nearest neighbors of a given query point, so that we can assign a class label to that point. To determine which data points are closest to a given query point, the distance between the query point and the other data points will need to be calculated. The distance measures used can vary depending on the data set or implementation and help inform decision boundaries, which query points into different regions. Then, by defining the k-value (the number of neighbors to be checked to determine the classification of a specific query point), the data can be assigned its class label.\n\nFor classification problems, a class label is assigned on the basis of a majority vote—i.e. the label that is most frequently represented around a given data point is used (the term “majority vote” is commonly used in literature, however, the technique is more technically considered “plurality voting”).  Regression problems use a similar concept as classification problem, but in this case, the average the k nearest neighbors is taken to make a prediction about a classification. The main distinction here is that classification is used for discrete values, whereas regression is used with continuous ones.\n\nUnlike other algorithms that explicitly model the problem, such as linear regression, KNN is instance-based. It means that the algorithm doesn't explicitly learn a model. Instead, it memorizes the training instances and uses them as \"knowledge\" for the prediction phase. It's also worth noting that the KNN algorithm is also part of a family of “lazy learning” models, meaning that it only stores a training dataset versus undergoing a training stage.\n\n## **Considerations**\n\n* **Scaling:** Scaling is a problem as KNN is a lazy algorithm and takes up more memory and storage compared to other classification methods.\n\n* **Implementation and Hyperparameters:** As KNN only requires a k-value and a distance metric, it is often an easy implementation and can adjust will to new training data.\n\n## Key Test Considerations\n\n- **Supervised Learning:**\n\n  - **Cross Validation:** As cross validation methods like k-fold, leave-one-out, and stratified cross validation can help validate model performance. However, nuances like pessimism bias in k-fold cross validation or high variability in leave-one-out cross validation may need consideration.\n\n- **Classification:**\n\n  - **ROC Curve:**  A standard technique used to summarize classifier performance over a range of tradeoffs between true and false positives is the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.\n\n  - **Data Imbalance:** Imbalanced data sets where one class significantly outnumbers others, under sampling techniques like SMOTE may be beneficial in sampling minority classes.\n\n- **K-Nearest Neighbor**\n\n  - **Choice of K:** The number of neighbors, K, affects the decision boundary. A smaller K can lead to a noisy decision boundary, while a large K can smooth it out, but may also blur class distinctions.\n\n  - **K-d Tree:** Exact searching on large datasets can be computationally costly and inefficient. Implementing approximate nearest neighbor algorithms like the K-d tree algorithm.\n\n  - **Dimensionality:** KNN does not perform well while using high-dimensional data and can be sensitive to irrelevant features which can lead to overfitting.\n\n  - **Distance Metric:** Choosing the appropriate distance metric (Euclidean, Manhattan, MinKowski, Hamming etc.) is essential, based on the nature of the data.\n\n## **References**\n1.

For example with virtual address space:\n\n* Process A address space is different from process B address space, which prevents process A from writing to process B\n\nHardware process isolation is commonly implemented through Direct Memory Access (DMA) which collaborates with a Memory Management Unit (MMU), or Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU). These hardware controls are deployed directly on processors to aid hosts or enclaves in process isolation.\n\n* DMA - Direct memory access allows memory access to occur independently of the program currently run by the microprocessor. DMA allows for I/O devices to directly read from and write to memory, or it can be used to efficiently copy blocks of memory. During DMA transfers, the microprocessor can execute an unrelated program.\n* MMU - A memory management unit acts as an access control and is responsible for performing the translation of virtual memory addresses to physical memory addresses. The MMU allocates each process its own virtual memory space.\n* IOMMU - An input-output memory management unit is used to allocate each I/O device its own virtual address space to the underlying physical addresses. IOMMU allows devices that do not support long memory addresses to address the entire memory space.\n\n## Considerations\n* Private hosts may be vulnerable to DMA attack if they have a PCI or PCI Express port that connects attached devices directly to physical address space.\n\n## Implementations:\n * Intel Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (Intel VT-d)\n * Firecracker",

Their detection requires that software-based AVs continuously scan memory, which is expensive due to repeated locks and polls. However, research advances introduced near-memory and in-memory processing, which allow memory controllers to trigger basic computations without moving data to the CPU. In this paper, we address AVs performance overhead by moving them to the hardware, i.e., we propose instrumenting processors’ memory controller or smart memories (near- and in-memory malware detection, respectively) to accelerate memory scanning procedures. To do so, we present MINI-ME, the Malware Identification based on Near- and In-Memory Evaluation mechanism, a hardware-based AV accelerator that interrupts the program’s execution if malicious patterns are discovered in their memory. We prototyped MINI-ME in a simulator and tested it with a set of 21 thousand in-the-wild malware samples, which resulted in multiple signatures matching with less than 1% of performance overhead and rates of 100% detection, and zero false-positives and false-negatives.",

It can be used to remotely edit configuration, start services, query files, and anything that can be done with a WMI class. When remote WMI requests are over RPC (CAR-2014-05-001), it connects to a DCOM interface within the RPC group netsvcs. To detect this activity, a sensor is needed at the network level that can decode RPC traffic or on the host where the communication can be detected more natively, such as Event Tracing for Windows. Using wireshark/tshark decoders, the WMI interfaces can be extracted so that WMI activity over RPC can be detected.\n\nAlthough the description details how to detect remote WMI precisely, a decent estimate has been to look for the string RPCSS within the initial RPC connection on 135/tcp. It returns a superset of this activity, and will trigger on all DCOM-related services running within RPC, which is likely to also be activity that should be detected between hosts.

      "d3f:kb-abstract": "Various families of malware use domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to generate a large number of pseudo-random domain names to connect to a command and control (C&C) server. In order to block DGA C&C traffic, security organizations must first discover the algorithm by reverse engineering malware samples, then generating a list of domains for a given seed. The domains are then either preregistered or published in a DNS blacklist. This process is not only tedious, but can be readily circumvented by malware authors using a large number of seeds in algorithms with multivariate recurrence properties (e.g., banjori) or by using a dynamic list of seeds (e.g., bedep). Another technique to stop malware from using DGAs is to intercept DNS queries on a network and predict whether domains are DGA generated. Such a technique will alert network administrators to the presence of malware on their networks. In addition, if the predictor can also accurately predict the family of DGAs, then network administrators can also be alerted to the type of malware that is on their networks. This paper presents a DGA classifier that leverages long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to predict DGAs and their respective families without the need for a priori feature extraction. Results are significantly better than state-of-the-art techniques, providing 0.9993 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for binary classification and a micro-averaged F1 score of 0.9906. In other terms, the LSTM technique can provide a 90% detection rate with a 1:10000 false positive (FP) rate---a twenty times FP improvement over comparable methods. Experiments in this paper are run on open datasets and code snippets are provided to reproduce the results.",

Status information can include software details (version, configuration, etc), endpoint identification (MAC, IP address, machine ID) or other hardware/software configuration information. Interruption of the heartbeat can signal that the endpoint has been compromised.\n\n## Considerations\n* Security of heartbeat messages to ensure message integrity\n* Disappearance of the heartbeat could simply mean that the endpoint is powered off or intentionally disconnected from the network. Therefore other criteria may need to be used to accurately detect endpoint compromise.\n* Attacker presence on the machine may leave the heartbeat intact.\n* An attacker may determine the format of the heartbeat and continue to send it even after the machine is compromised.",

Once the stream is reassembled pattern matching is applied to determine if it contains a file of interest. Files of interest range from executable, archive, or document file formats. Once the file is captured, it is then processed with standard File Analysis Techniques. Example network protocols include HTTP, SMTP, FTP, HTTP/2, and TLS/HTTP/Dropbox.\n\n## Considerations\n- This is an error prone process due to the intricacies of network protocols and network packet capture.  For example reassembly may be done in real-time or streaming fashion, or packets may be written to disk, then bulk processed.  The packets may arrive out of order, with fragmentation, duplicates, or re-transmissions.  The reassembly software must compensate for the imperfect packet stream in order to recreate the well formed file which was transmitted.\n- File type identification can be a difficult process which can be exploited by adversaries.",

The /c flag causes the command shell to run a command and immediately exit. As a result, the desired program will remain running and it will report an error starting the service. This analytic will catch that command prompt instance that is used to launch the actual malicious executable.

Metadata from network traffic such as packet header information or information about a session (ex. time between request/responses) is extracted. After the metadata is extracted, the data is grouped into cluster maps of matching events to track how many instances of a network communication have occurred, such as five requests sent and five responses received. Threshold limits are set on the clusters to monitor them and if a cluster grows too large (ex. ten instances of requests and responses) this can correspond to unauthorized behavior. This method might detect, for example, a network attack using malicious payloads with automated scripts, in which a bot sends replicated malicious payloads to the same destination port.",

Referencing SP 800-53A, the controls are divided into more granular parts (determination statements) to be assessed. The parts of the control assessed by each determination statement are called control items. The control items are then grouped into the appropriate security capabilities. As suggested by SP 800-53 Revision 4, security capabilities are groups of controls that support a common purpose. For effective automated assessment, testable defect checks are defined that bridge the determination statements to the broader security capabilities to be achieved and to the SP 800-53 security control items themselves. The defect checks correspond to security sub-capabilities-called sub-capabilities because each is part of a larger capability. Capabilities and sub-capabilities are both designed with the purpose of addressing a series of attack steps. Automated assessments (in the form of defect checks) are performed using the test assessment method defined in SP 800-53A by comparing a desired and actual state (or behavior).",

One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the <code>CreateProcess</code> API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use.(Citation: DidierStevens SelectMyParent Nov 2009) This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via <code>svchost.exe</code> or <code>consent.exe</code>) rather than the current user context.(Citation: Microsoft UAC Nov 2018)",

The RMF includes activities to prepare organizations to execute the framework at appropriate risk management levels. The RMF also promotes near real-time risk management and ongoing information system and common control authorization through the implementation of continuous monitoring processes; provides senior leaders and executives with the necessary information to make efficient, cost-effective, risk management decisions about the systems supporting their missions and business functions; and incorporates security and privacy into the system development life cycle. Executing the RMF tasks links essential risk management processes at the system level to risk management processes at the organization level. In addition, it establishes responsibility and accountability for the controls implemented within an organization’s information systems and inherited by those systems.",

A dependent DLL associated with the driver is configured to be processed before other dependent DLLs and executes a number of operations to ensure the driver associated with the security agent is initialized first.\n\n* Kernel components can be signed by a certificate obtained by a third party to verify the source of the component and whether it has been modified. When signed, the component will include a signature block implemented as a hash value of the component header and can also include a certificate chain. The signature and certificate data are typically added before the kernel component is distributed to the public.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\n* The private keys to sign certificates as reputable companies have been stolen in the past -- in cases such as where certificates from Adobe, Realtek, and JMicron have been used to sign malicious executables. (Source: https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/cybercrime-exploits-digital-certificates/#gref)\n\n* Trusted Root Certificate Authorities have been compromised, yielding the ability to use the compromised keys to generate certificates with an arbitrary company name.\n\n* It may not be difficult for an attacker to start an organization which can obtain a signed certificate.\n\n* A root certificate authority (CA) whose certificate is trusted in the verification logic could generate incorrect certificates, if they are lax or have ulterior motives.",

There are numerous RPC specifications and implementations. RPC capabilities can be abused by attackers in order to achieve a variety of tactical objectives including execution, persistence, initial access, and more. RPC proxies may be used to collect and store RPC traffic. RPCs can occur over network sockets or named pipes.\n\nAnalytics look for unauthorized behavior such as:\n\n* Processes being launched or scheduled remotely\n* System configurations being changed remotely\n* Unauthorized file read activity\n\nExample RPC Protocols:\n\n* DCE/RPC\n* CORBA\n* Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call\n* D-Bus\n* XML-RPC\n* JSON-RPC\n* SOAP\n* Apache Thrift\n\n## Considerations\n* RPC is widely used in enterprise environments, and significant data filtering may be required in large environments to enable analytic processing.\n* RPC traffic may occur over a pipe, or within a host over loopback interface, thus making network collection difficult.",

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How It Works\nWhen a process encounters an exception, it calls an exception handler to deal with the exception.  The method by which this exception handler is determined varies by the operating system.  The exception handler is called, even if it is the default exception handler to terminate the program and display a message that the program stopped working.  In the case that no valid exception handler is found, the program would fail to proceed as normal and could be programmed to terminate.\n\nIn Windows, the address of the exception registration record is stored at the very start of the the Thread Information Block; the GS register points to this structure.\n\nThe exception registration record contains two pointers: a pointer to the next exception registration record should this handler fail to handle the exception, and a pointer to the handler.\n\nA buffer overflow can overwrite the saved return pointer with an invalid location to execute memory; this often triggers the exception handler chain, which could also be corrupted by the buffer overflow.  Although Process Exception Handler Validation does not make sure that the exception handler pointer or the code at the exception handler was unaltered, or that the exception handler code is secure, this technique does ensure that the pointer is at least an exception handler that could be called by the program.\n\nWith Process Exception Handler Validation, before the handler is called, it checks the exception handler against a source of valid exception handlers.  If the requested handler is not in this list, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.\n\n### Runtime valid exception handler source generation\nThe source of valid exception handlers could be generated at runtime, with the risk of the information that is used to determine the validity of exception handlers being compromised.\n\n### Compile-time\nThe source of valid exception handlers could also be generated at compile time or as a binary patch.  Given the source code, it would be rather straightforward to find the exceptions, as they are pointed in the catch statement of a try-catch clause and the compiler must already generate the code to call exceptions from this.\n\n## Considerations\nIf the program file can be altered by the attacker, then the security could be bypassed by replacing it with any desired program, without even bypassing SEH.\n\nIf the attacker was already able to overwrite the code for a valid exception handler via other functionality in the program, this defense would not prevent arbitrary code execution.\nIf an exception handler recognized as valid is vulnerable, it would be executed anyway.\n\nSafeSEH might be applied only to some executable files or modules, allowing an attacker to call any piece of code as an exception handler in the unprotected modules.",

Like most ATT&CK techniques, this behavior can be used legitimately, and the reliability of an analytic depends on the proper identification of the pre-existing legitimate behaviors. Although this behavior is disabled in many Windows configurations, it is possible to remotely enable the RemoteRegistry service, which can be detected with CAR-2014-03-005.\n\nRemote access to the registry can be achieved via\n\n* Windows API function RegConnectRegistry\n* command line via reg.exe\n* graphically via regedit.exe\n\nAll of these behaviors call into the Windows API, which uses the NamedPipe WINREG over SMB to handle the protocol information.

These activities are then analyzed to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs). These indicators are then fed into a forensics analysis engine, which then quickly decides whether a subject (e.g., process, user) is malicious. If so, the system takes some proactive action to alert a proper authority, to quarantine the potential attack, or to provide other remediation.

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\nThis technique is used to detect an attacker attempting to exploit and execute code on a target system's call stack using return-oriented programming (ROP). Modern processors that have the ability to maintain a list of the branching calls, e.g., Intel's Last Branch Recording (LBR), can be used to track and analyze indirect branching calls that are indicative of malicious activity.\n\nIn order to reduce the number of indirect branch calls to analyze to a manageable set it is assumed that malicious ROP activity will involve the use of system calls.  The technique observes indirect branch calls that are part of paths that lead to system calls, all others are ignored. Branching calls chained together is often referred to as gadgets and gadgets are often used in ROP attacks. Indirect branch calls that involve a transfer from user-space to kernel-space are of interest for this technique.\n\nIdentification of potential ROP exploit execution includes:\n\n- Inspecting the LBR when a system function call is made\n\n  - The LBR is configured to return only instruction of interest (ret, indirect jmp, indirect calls)\n\n\n- Behavior is analyzed for\n  - Ret instructions that appear to target areas not preceded by the call sites\n  - Sequences of small code fragments that appear to be chained through the indirect branching calls (gadgets)\n\n\n- Of interest are returns that appear to not render control back after calls\n  - Typical ret-call are paired\n  - gadgets will appear to have ret followed by instruction of next instruction of the following gadget\n\n\n## Considerations\n\n* May be operating system dependent since specific system calls are used to scope branching behavoir\n* Processors need to support access to a Last Branch Recording list feature\n* The size of the LBR stack can limit the expected size of the analyzed execution stack\n* If processor does not support LBR then overhead costs for the analysis can be significant",

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\nBytes are analyzed as if they are machine code instructions, and such instructions that are a common component of known shellcode are noted, such as stack pivots, reads from a Memory Address Table, and system calls for functions that disable protections or execute code.  For example, the x86 instruction `b0 0b: mov $11, %ax`, with no further alterations to the `%ax` register, followed by `cd 80: syscall` executes the system call `execve()` in the Linux kernel, which replaces the current process with another one specified -- this is a common action in shellcode, so this sequence would be flagged.\n\nThis technique detects shellcode despite whether or not it would cause a buffer overflow in the target binary.\n\nIf the sequence of bytes contains a sequence similar to that used in malicious shellcode, the entire byte sequence is flagged and a follow-on technique may be invoked.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### False Negatives\nIf the shellcode instructions are far apart, simple implementations might not detect the shellcode.\n\nDue to the nature of assembly instructions not having a defined start or end, implementations which do not process all start sequences (for example, when they a find byte sequence of interest, continue scanning forwards from the end of it) might not detect the shellcode.\n\nThis technique might not detect more complex or obfuscated instructions.  For that purpose, Dynamic Analysis or Emulated File Analysis could assist by analyzing the actual instruction function.\n\nThis technique may not detect self-modifying code.  To make it harder for a process to modify itself, Process Segment Execution Prevention should be used, while noting its considerations.\n\nThis technique might not detect malicious shellcode which reuses instructions in the target binary for malicious effect, as memory references in the presumed assembly code are not dereferenced.  Dynamic Analysis and Emulated File Analysis, when set up properly to fork from the running target binary, might detect this.  Process Segment Execution Prevention combined with Segment Address Offset Randomization frequently makes introduction of shellcode through overwriting a saved return pointer more difficult.  Call stack depth analysis might detect excessive reuse of instructions in the target binary.  Shadow Stack Frames might detect that a stack frame's return address has changed and Stack Frame Canary Verification might detect that the stack frame's return address was overwritten.  Other heuristic methods might detect jump-oriented programming shellcode.\n\nWith inserting code directly, that it is not a buffer overflow, and just some place where code is executed either to a file or a write-what-where, the buffer overflow mitigations do not help.  Behavioral analysis could detect this, or proper access control could mitigate this.\n\n### False Positives\n\nByte sequences containing code that is never used as machine code are still analyzed and flagged for anomalies, and [eventually](http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55871.html), it is likely that an attack sequence will arise from the sheer volume of bytes transmitted.",

It's worth considering whether decoy online personas might help in the quest to safeguard our digital identities and data.\n\nI believe deception tactics, such as selective and careful use of honeypots, holds promise for defending enterprise IT resources. Some forms of deception could also protect individuals against online scammers and other attackers. This approach might not be quite practical today for most people, but in the future we might find it both necessary and achievable.\n\nHuman attackers and malicious software pursue user accounts and data on-line through harvesting, phishing, password-guessing, software vulnerabilities, and various other means. How might we use decoys to confuse, misdirect, slow down and detect adversaries engaged in such activities?\n\n...\n\nThe wealth of personal details available on social networking sites allows attackers to target individuals using social engineering, secret question-guessing and other techniques. For some examples of such approaches, see The Use of Fake or Fraudulent LinkedIn Profiles and Data Mining Resumes for Computer Attack Reconnaissance.\n\nSetting up one or more fake social network profiles (e.g., on Facebook) that use the person's real name can help the individual deflect the attack or can act as an early warning of an impending attack. A decoy profile could purposefully expose some inaccurate information, while the person's real profile would be more carefully concealed using the site's privacy settings. Decoy profiles would be associated with spamtrap email addresses.\n\nSimilarly, the person could expose decoy profiles on other sites, for instance those reveal shopping habits (e.g., Amazon), musings (e.g., Twitter), skills (e.g., GitHub), travel (e.g., TripIt), affections (e.g., Pinterest), music taste (e.g., Pandora) and so on. The person's decoy identities could also have fake resumes available on sites such as Indeed and Monster.com.",

Symmetric-key algorithms are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext. The keys may be identical or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys. The keys, in practice, represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private information link. This requirement that both parties have access to the secret key is one of the main drawbacks of symmetric key encryption, in comparison to public-key encrytption (also known as asymmetric key encryption).",

Firewalls are deployed either directly on hosts through kernel level software implementations or installed in-line directly on network links. There are benefits and disadvantages to each approach.\n\nThere are various strategies for developing filtering rulesets:\n\n* Block everything by default\n* Limit destination hosts\n* Limit destination transport or application protocols\n* Restrict content outbound (Ex. strings formatted as social security numbers, or proprietary data)\n\n## Considerations\n* Dynamic IP assignment creates challenges for Outbound Traffic Filtering because users are not necessarily associated with the same IP address. This can be addressed by linking IP address management information with the filtering logic.\n* Connections using non-standard transport layer ports may circumvent outbound traffic filtering technology which does not detect application protocol based on traffic content.\n* Business requirements typically drive the development of filtering rule sets.\n\n## Implementations\n- iptables (Linux)\n- Windows Firewall\n- pf (BSD)",

A variation of the the technique, \"domainless\" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).",

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\nThis defense must be applied at compile-time, or via a patch to the program binary.  Stack Frame Canary Verification inserts instructions at the prologue and epilogue of desired functions.  In the prologue, a canary value, typically with the same size as the register size, is stored in the system of record and on the stack.  Typically, the canary is loaded to where it has a memory address just below that of the saved instruction pointer and base pointer.  In the epilogue, the canary value stored on the stack and, is compared to the canary value in the system of record.  If the values are different, other techniques such as those in Process Eviction might be invoked, such as Process Termination to end the current process, or Executable Blacklisting to blacklist the potentially vulnerable or malfunctioning executable.\n\nStack Frame Canary Verification is commonly used to detect potential tampering of a saved register value on the stack before it has been restored.  Examples of registers with values commonly saved to the stack include the instruction pointer and the base pointer.\n\nThe canary should be stored between where the start of a buffer overrun is likely, and the data to protect, in cases where the buffer size increases it will overwrite the data to be protected.\n\nOn most processor architectures, including x86, x64, and ARM, a \"push\" operation to store data to the stack grows the stack towards a lower memory address.  As in these architectures, saved register values are stored to the stack at a point in time just before space is made for the local function variables, the saved register values have a higher address than that of the local function variables.  Values at increasing indexes of a buffer are written to increasing memory addresses; therefore, an overwrite in the local variable buffer could overwrite saved register values, and a stack canary between these two would be useful in detecting an overwrite.\n\nOn some other processor architectures such as the B5000, the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, and some architectures, such as System Z and RCA1802A, stack direction can be chosen.  If the stack grows towards increasing memory addresses, while this architecture inherently provides more protection against a saved register being overwritten, other data including local function variables might be overwritten.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nThere are several ways that the protection provided by a canary could be rendered ineffective.\n\n### Performing a malicious action before the canary is checked\n\nIf the attacker alters the memory in such a way that it performs a malicious action before the epilogue is called, then this protection will not be effective.  This includes altering the logic of the program by altering the values of local variables stored on the function stack, or by causing an exception and exploiting the exception mechanism such as the SEH (Structured Exception Handling) mechanism on Windows.\n\n### Determining the canary value\n\nDetermining the canary value is possible through reading memory either for the code used to check the canary, or from the stored canary value itself in a stack frame.\n\n### Changing the canary value\n\nA vulnerability such as a write-what-where condition that allows one to write data after the canary in the stack, would allow control of the value of the saved instruction pointer without needing to know the canary value.",

The rules are usually expressed in a domain specific language (DSL), then deployed to software that scans files for matches. The rules are developed and broadly distributed by commercial vendors, or they are developed and deployed by enterprise security teams to address highly targeted or custom malware. Conceptually, there are public and private rule sets. Both leverage the same technology, but they are intended to detect different types of cyber adversaries.\n\n## Considerations\n* Patterns expressed in the DSLs range in their complexity. Some scanning engines support file parsing and normalization for high fidelity matching, others support only simple regular expression matching against raw file data. Engineers must make a trade-off in terms of:\n     * The fidelity of the matching capabilities in order to balance high recall with avoiding false positives,\n     * The computational load for scanning, and\n     * The resilience of the engine to deal with adversarial content presented in different forms-- content which in some cases is designed to exploit or defeat the scanning engines.\n * Signature libraries can become large over time and impact scanning performance.\n * Some vendors who sell signatures have to delete old signatures over time.\n * Simple signatures against raw content cannot match against encoded, encrypted, or sufficiently obfuscated content.\n\n## Implementations\n * YARA\n * ClamAV",

If the IP address(es) are in a range included in the blacklist, then the response is dropped and not forwarded to the client.\n\nThe DNS lookup can be blocked by either dropping the network traffic with an inline device, or modifying the value of the response sent by the DNS server. To transparently prevent client applications from hanging on a request, it is common practice to replace malicious values with addresses in the range 127.0.0.0/8 or the address of a honeypot maintained by the network administrators.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* This technique does not prevent the client from contacting the blacklisted IP, only from learning about this IP address via a nameserver lookup request.\n* DNS Response traffic can be transmitted over many different protocols, which presents a challenge to implementing methods to extract all DNS answer IP address value(s).\n  * DNS has historically used UDP port 53, with TCP port 53 instead used for responses over 512 bytes or after a lack of response over UDP.\n  * Usage of new protocols to provide confidentiality for DNS traffic, such as DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS), complicates collection of the IP address(es) in DNS responses. These protocols have often been enabled in browser settings transparently after a browser update, with DNS requests proxied over one of these cryptographic protocols through a specified host.\n* This technique must be implemented logically between the application that receives the response and the server which sent the response.\n  * DNS responses sent in an encrypted manner, such as those using DoH or DoT, will require interception of the TLS connections in order to determine the IP address(es) in the response.\n* Replacing the response is not effective in the case that the nameserver uses a technique to provide integrity of its responses, such as DNSSEC for DNS responses.",

As part of the eviction process, these files and programs should be removed to prevent further compromise or reinfection. Examples of malicious types of files are malware which is directly harmful and content files with the intent to deceive users (e.g., phishing.)\n\nOn Windows systems, antivirus (AV) software should be used to safely and permanently remove malicious files. AV software may first quarantine a suspected malicious file, which is the process of moving a file from its original location to a new location and makes changes so that it cannot be executed. Users can then verify that the file is not benign and then permanently delete it.\n\n## Considerations\n\nWhen it is determined that a file should be removed for security purposes, the organization--or systems implementing an organization's policies--may determine that the file should not simply be deleted from the enterprise's mission systems, but be quarantined to a secure system by an approved mechanism, so as to allow follow-up investigation by security staff.\n\nOn Windows systems, deleting a file in File Explorer does not permanently delete a file - it sends it to the Recycle Bin instead. The Recycle Bin must be emptied, or alternative steps must be performed to remove files completely. Even then, in some cases the data may persist in disk, so data shredder tools may be needed to completely wipe a file. Thus, AV tools are recommended.",

The system then generates a causality chain for the at least one event respective of the analysis. The causality chain comprises all the threads that attributed to the at least one event in a chronological order. The system then identifies a main thread that started the causality chain that led to the at least one event.

Tools like SafetyKatz, SafetyDump, and Outflank-Dumpert default to this variant and may be detected by this analytic, though keep in mind that not all options for using those tools will result in this specific behavior.\n\nThe analytic is based on a Sigma analytic contributed by Samir Bousseaden and written up in a blog on MENASEC. It looks for a call trace that includes either dbghelp.dll or dbgcore.dll, which export the relevant functions/permissions to perform the dump. It also detects using the Windows Task Manager (taskmgr.exe) to dump lsass, which is described in CAR-2019-08-001. In this iteration of the Sigma analytic, the GrantedAccess filter isn’t included because it didn’t seem to filter out any false positives and introduces the potential for evasion.\n\nThis analytic was tested both in a lab and in a production environment with a very low false-positive rate. werfault.exe and tasklist.exe, both standard Windows processes, showed up multiple times as false positives.",

This can detect attackers (which will tend to need the binaries for something different than normal usage) but will also tend to have false positives.\n\nThe analytic needs to be tuned. The 1.5 in the query is the number of standard deviations away to look. It can be tuned up to filter out more noise and tuned down to get more results.

The SGL facilitates building and maintaining a graph database to catalogue vulnerabilities found in open-source components. This graphical database can be accessed via a database interface directly or accessed by an agent that interacts with the database interface. To build the graph database, a database interface processes an open-source component and creates graph structures which represent relationships present in the open-source component. The database interface transforms a vulnerability description into a canonical form based on a schema for the graph database and updates the database based on a determination of whether the vulnerability is a duplicate. This ensures quality and consistency of the vulnerability dataset maintained in the graph database.",

The combination of the likelihood function for the observed data with each of the prior distributions yields hypothesis-specific models. For each of the hypothesis-specific models, averaging (ie, integrating) the likelihood with respect to the prior distribution across the entire parameter space yields the probability of the data under the model and, therefore, the corresponding hypothesis. This quantity is more commonly referred to as the marginal likelihood and represents the average fit of the model to the data. The ratio of the marginal likelihoods for both hypothesis-specific models is known as the Bayes factor.\n\n## References\nBaig, S. A., PhD. (2020).

Engineering-based solutions are essential to managing the growing complexity, dynamicity, and interconnectedness of today’s systems, as exemplified by cyber-physical systems and systems-of-systems, including the Internet of Things. This publication addresses the engineering-driven perspective and actions necessary to develop more defensible and survivable systems, inclusive of the machine, physical, and human components that compose the systems and the capabilities and services delivered by those systems. It starts with and builds upon a set of well-established International Standards for systems and software engineering published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and infuses systems security engineering methods, practices, and techniques into those systems and software engineering activities. The objective is to address security issues from a stakeholder protection needs, concerns, and requirements perspective and to use established engineering processes to ensure that such needs, concerns, and requirements are addressed with appropriate fidelity and rigor, early and in a sustainable manner throughout the life cycle of the system.",

      "d3f:kb-abstract": "Microsoft Windows uses its implementation of Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Call (DCE/RPC), which it calls Microsoft RPC, to call certain APIs remotely.\n\nA Remote Procedure Call is initiated by communicating to the RPC Endpoint Mapper, which exists as the Windows service RpcEptMapper and listens on the port 135/tcp. The endpoint mapper resolves a requested endpoint/interface and responds to the client with the port that the service is listening on. Since the RPC endpoints are assigned ports when the services start, these ports are dynamically assigned from 49152 to 65535. The connection to the endpoint mapper then terminates and the client program can communicate directly with the requested service.\n\nRPC is a legitimate functionality of Windows that allows remote interaction with a variety of services. For a Windows environment to be properly configured, several programs use RPC to communicate legitimately with servers. The background and benign RPC activity may be enormous, but must be learned, especially peer-to-peer RPC between workstations, which is often indicative of Lateral Movement.",

These attributes are analyzed to look for the presence or absence of specific values or patterns.\n\nSome attributes of interest are:\n - user\n - process name\n - image path\n - security content\n\n## Considerations\n\n - Attackers can spoof the parent process identifier (PPID), which could bypass this defense to allow execution of a malicious process from an arbitrary parent process.\n - Attackers could have legitimately compromised any of the process properties, such as the user, to make the execution appear legitimate.\n - Location: If the full image path is not checked, there could be a conflict with an executable that appears earlier due to resolution involving the system environment path/classpath variable.\n - Parsing issues: If the raw command from a shell is analyzed, rather than the actual function call, it is important to identify the actual command  being run from its arguments.  In Windows, services with unquoted file paths containing spaces will try to use the first token as the executable and the rest as arguments -- and shift tokens to the executable until a valid one is found.\n - Some [operating systems](/dao/artifact/d3f:OperatingSystem) can spawn processes without forking.",

The information may be polled by network management softare or configured once and then pushed from network sensors (or agents.)\n\nAnother means of establishing network connectivity is by means of sendingn traffic through the use of a tool such as traceroute, to determine the logical paths through the network architecture.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* Best practice is to encrypte network monitoring data and require authentication for queries or admin/management functions.\n* Push notifications reduce bandwidth necessary to capture and maintain information if reliable transport is used.\n* Special consideration should be made before using of active scanning in OT networks and OT-safe options chosen where available.",

It is possible to also connect via IP address, in which case the string \"\\<hostname\\>\" would instead look like IP Address.\n\nAlthough this analytic was created after CAR-2014-12-001, it is a much simpler (although more limited) approach. Processes can be created remotely via WMI in a few other ways, such as more direct API access or the built-in utility PowerShell.",

Access determinations are based on designed access control polices and are not based on local resource owner determinations.\n\nAccess is typically granted by defining sets of subjects and sets of objects. Subjects are the entities requesting access and objects are the resources that subjects are trying to access. Rules and policies are defined that associate subjects and object permissions and access controls.\n\n### Common MAC implementations\n#### Security label access control\nA fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels to individual resources, including processes, and the access control decisions are against a particular resource and a given user attempting to gain access. This type of MAC requires that the file system has built-in support for security labels.\n\nAccess controls are typically implemented through the use of label identifiers for every file system object. Identifier labels are applied to resources and users are assigned a similar access identifier. Users attempting to access a resource will result in the operating system performing an access control check. The access control check will compare the assigned user's credentials to that of the resource or object they are attempting to access.\n\nA security context is associated with resources and is used to determine assess. Typical basic access control elements include users, roles and types and together they form a security context which is the basis for the security labels.\n\nThis type of access control is what is employed in SELinux [2]. This form of MAC is considered the most flexible implementation, but it also is the most complex to deploy across the enterprise. Where multiple virtual machines (VM) are run together this type of access control is typically employed to ensure true isolation of processes and VMs.\n\n#### File path level controls\nA less fine-grained form of mandatory access control is to apply security labels that allow for access control at the file path level.  Access control is filesystem agnostic and no relabeling of resources is required. Pathname access control usually seems more natural for implementation and corresponding access audits.\n\nThis type of MAC is what is employed in AppArmor [3]. AppArmor was developed to provide a simpler alternative MAC method with much less management overhead. A simple access policy is maintained that defines path resource access rules. Access control attributes are typically associated with programs instead of users.\n\n\n## Considerations\nSome implementations of security label mandatory access control contain complex rules set that are hard to verify and complex to maintain over time.\n\nInitial planning of access model and continuous monitoring of the available users, resources and object is necessary.\n\n## Implementations\n\n * Linux C-Groups, and policy engines like SELinux and AppArmor\n * Windows Mandatory Integrity Control introduced in Windows Vista\n\n\n### Citations\n1.

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\n### Digital Signature\nDigital signatures are used to verifying a message is from the expected sender. In email, Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol is typically used to digitally sign messages. A hash value of the sender's message is created and encrypted with the sender's private key to create a digital signature. The message and the digital signature are sent to the recipient where the sender's public key is used to decrypt the digital signature and compute the hash of the message. The computed hash is compared with the hash from the received message, and any difference in the hash values signify the message did not originate from the sender and has been alerted in transit.\n\n### Message Authentication Code (MAC)\nMAC is a fixed size string that is appended to a message to provide message authentication and integrity. The sender MAC signing algorithm takes as input a secret symmetric key shared between sender and recipient and the message to calculate a short tag that is appended to the message. The recipient receives the message with the appended tag, and a MAC verification algorithm is run using the symmetric key to verify the message came from the stated sender and ensure the message has not been tampered with.\n\n## Considerations\n- Public keys associated with digital signatures should be verified by a Certification Authority (CA) to prevent impersonation. The CA verifies the owner of a public key and puts the sender's identity and public key into a certificate that is signed by the CA.\n- Digital signatures provide non-repudiation where a third party can verify the authenticity of the message using the sender's digital certificate signed by the CA.\n- Symmetric keys must be exchanged securely via a private channel and management of new symmetric keys are needed for each pair of participants wishing to exchange messages.",

Before calling an exception handler, Windows XP SP2 software-enforced DEP checks whether the exception handler is located in a memory region marked as executable.  If the program was also built with SafeSEH, this implementation also checks before changing control to the exception handler whether it is a registered exception handler in the program's file on disk.\n\n### Hardware-based implementations\nThe NX (No Execute) or XD (Execute Disable) bit on the processor specifies whether a certain part of memory is executable.  Early implementations set this bit by the memory segment, while modern implementations which are built on the flat memory model often store this bit in each entry of the page table, to control execution by the page.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nNon-hardware process data segment execution prevention is more susceptible to being able to be turned off for a page of memory.\n\nDifferent implementations of this defense have been in place since the 1980s, but implementation stalled when larger 16-bit programs began stuffing code in the segments usually reserved for data. Many modern programs follow the best practice of separation of code and data, are able to run under this defense.\n\nROP or ret2libc/return-to-function attacks could bypass this defense, as although they may pass attacker-controlled data or stack frames to a function, they abuse functions that are legitimately located in the .text segment (code segment) of the program.  For those, more advanced defenses such as a table of valid jump addresses, function call analysis, or return depth analysis could be used.",

A transaction is proposed by a seller, and the buyer signals his acceptance by entering his personal authentication information comprising a PIN and at least one biometric sample, forming a commercial transaction message. The commercial transaction message is forwarded to the computer system, where the computer system compares the personal authentication information in the commercial transaction message with previously registered buyer biometric samples. If the computer system successfully identifies the buyer, a financial account of the buyer is debited and a financial account of the seller is credited, and the results of the transaction are presented to both buyer and seller. As a result of the invention, a buyer can conduct commercial transactions without having to use any tokens such as portable man-made memory devices such as smartcards or swipe cards. The invention allows buyers to quickly select one of a group of different financial accounts from which to transfer funds. The invention further indicates to the user that the authentic computer system was accessed by the use of a private code that is returned to the buyer after the identification is complete. The invention additionally permits an authorized buyer to alert authorities in the event of an emergency, such as when a transaction is coerced.",

The switching ASIC has a high-speed memory table which enables it to look up addresses that it has previously obtained and to forward unicast packets to said addresses. The VSE is a CPU that makes switching decisions outside of the ASIC and keeps track of any unknown addresses, forwarding the packets out the appropriate ports and answers broadcast packets by proxy for all known addresses without forwarding any of the packets down the VLANs, thereby freeing the VLAN bandwidth from excessive traffic. The system requires no user configuration because the switching methodology is self-adaptive to the network in which it is inserted and has the ability to perform router functions such as level 2 and 3 switching, spanning tree protocols and compatibility with Internetwork Packet and Internetwork Packet Exchange networks.",

Other applications record this data in local or remote databases.\n\nThe log entry for each system call, which may reference additional information such as the date and time, and the process tree for the process which made the system call, is relayed, in real time or post-facto, to an analysis module which consults a catalog or model to determine whether the distribution matches a known-good or known-bad pattern.\n\n\n### Analysis\n\nSystem calls are analyzed with a variety of methods. Some analytics look for specific sequences of instructions, others may apply statistical methods to identify abnormal behavior. Sequences of instructions can be abstracted into conceptually higher order user activities, for example:\n\n* An attacker executes many system calls in a short period of time, with several sequences which could be used to escalate privileges.\n* Getting the contents from a URL, writing to a new file, and then executing the same file.\n* A ransomware program which either uses a loop or creates many threads to: read a specified file, encrypt its contents, create an output file with a similar name to the original file, and delete the unencrypted original.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* Duplicative or extraneous system calls may be added to malware to defeat analytics.\n* Malware could replace API hooking instructions to allow system calls to be made without being monitored.\n* A model built from a training set of system calls and related data may not be updated fast enough to detect new threats.\n\n\n[1] [Syscalls](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html)\n\n[2] [Hooking](http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hooking)",

Values for each feature are combined to develop a score for the URL.\n* Determining the probability of a character occurring in the URL given the preceding two characters.

If the file is not known/trusted, SmartScreen will prevent the execution and warn the user not to run it.(Citation: Beek Use of VHD Dec 2020)(Citation: Outflank MotW 2020)(Citation: Intezer Russian APT Dec 2020)",

They accomplish this by comparing the current artifacts to a previous snapshot.\n\nUnix - Unix systems have a file integrity checker tool called tripwire. Tripwire first initializes a database that serves as a basis for comparison and can then scan the system to compare the state of the current file system against the initial baseline database. Additionally, users can define policies that specify potential violations.\n\nWindows - In Microsoft Azure, file integrity monitoring can be enabled which can track file and registry key creation, removals, and modifications of specific files.\n\n## Considerations\nFiles can change constantly due to the non-static nature of a computer system. File Integrity Monitoring works best when pointed at a narrow scope of critical files to limit the number of unneccessary files that may be modified over the course of normal use. The accuracy and precision of defined policies also affect the efficacy of this technique.",

The requestor's address, and the server's address are checked against a access control list. If either address is invalid, the proxy closes the connection. If both are valid, a new connection is setup such that both the requestor and server are transparently connected to the proxy with variable higher levels being connected in a relay mode. Protocol data units are interrogated for conformance to a protocol session, and optionally further decoded to add additional application specific filtering. In one embodiment, an OSI architecture comprises the levels.",

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\nAn example K-center Clustering problem is to mimimize the number of points in a set that are necessary so that a every other point in the set is within some fixed distance of those points.  For instance, given n cities with specified distances, one wants to build k warehouses in different cities and minimize the maximum distance of a city to a warehouse.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- **Scalability**: Exact solutions are NP-hard.  However, algorithms\n    that have been proven effective and create no more than 2x the\n    optimal set of clusters can run in O(kn) proportional to k*n where\n    k is the minimum number of clusters and n is the number of data\n    points being clustered.\n\n## Key Test Considerations\n\n- **Unsupervised Learning**:\n\n  - **Number of Clusters**: The Gonzalez (Gon) algorithm guarantees\n      creating no more than twice the optimal number of clusters,\n      where the optimal number is the minimum number of clusters to\n      minimize total distance between representative points in the\n      clusters [1].\n\n- **Cluster Analysis**:\n\n    - **Rand Index and Adjusted Rand Index**: Given ground truth set\n      of class labels for the data, the Rand Index is a measure of the\n      similarity between two data clusterings. The Rand Index is the\n      accuracy of determining if a link belongs within a cluster or\n      not. A form of the Rand Index may be defined that is adjusted\n      for the chance grouping of elements, this is the Adjusted Rand\n      Index [5].\n\n    - **Adjusted Mutual Information**: Given ground truth set of class\n      labels for the data, Adjusted Mutual Information corrects the\n      effect of agreement solely due to chance between clusterings,\n      similar to the way the Adjusted Rand Index corrects the Rand\n      Index [6].\n\n- **Connection-based Clustering**:\n\n  - **Choice of Distance Metric**: The outcome can vary significantly depending on the chosen distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).\n\n  - **Sensitivity**: Connection-based method can be sensitive to outliers, which might affect the quality of the clusters formed.\n\n- **K-center Clustering**:\n\n  - **Silhouette Score**: The silhouette score refers to a scoring\n    method that helps validate the consistency between clusters of\n    data. The evaluation technique also produces a concise graphical\n    representation of how well each object appear to have been\n    classified.  It is suited to K-centric Clustering in that it also\n    works for different metric spaces.\n\n  - **Distance Metric**: The distance measure must be a true metric (see\n    [2]).  Differences in the metric chosen may (e.g., Euclidean,a\n    Manhattan) affect results significantly.\n\n  - **Sensitivity**: Greedy implementations may be sensitive to\n    outliers.\n\n## Platforms, Tools, or Libraries\n\nN/A. _Note that this algorithm is relatively simple and so it is\nusually implemented from scratch by those incorporating this algorithm\ninto a system._\n\n## References\n\n1.

      "d3f:kb-abstract": "An adversary needs to gain access to other hosts to move throughout an environment. In many cases, this is a twofold process. First, a file is remotely written to a host via an SMB share (detected by CAR-2013-05-003). Then, a variety of Execution techniques can be used to remotely establish execution of the file or script. To detect this behavior, look for files that are written to a host over SMB and then later run directly as a process or in the command line arguments. SMB File Writes and Remote Execution may happen normally in an environment, but the combination of the two behaviors is less frequent and more likely to indicate adversarial activity.\n\nThis can possibly extend to more copy protocols in order to widen its reach, or it could be tuned more finely to focus on specific program run locations (e.g. %SYSTEMROOT%\\system32) to gain a higher detection rate.",

Dead code can be created by adding code under a condition that never evaluates to true. Dead code should be removed since this type of code can produce unexpected results, if accidentally or maliciously forced to execute.\n\nDead code identification is typically performed by algorithms that implement program flows analysis looking for unreachable code. The dead code is eliminated by instructing compilers to remove the code through compiler flags, i.e., '-fdce' is used for Dead Code Elimination.\n\n## Considerations\n\nCode can also be deemed unreachable for certain run-time conditions. Different deployed systems and environments may contain some code that is unreachable for the given environment. This technique does not consider run-time conditions for unreachable code.",

The agent software is configurable to limit the use of certain devices connected to IO ports. The restriction software can also be configured to limit the access to files and applications on external storage devices connected to IO ports.\n\nHardware-based restriction can also be employed to limit access to IO ports. For example, a hardware USB filter device that is placed between the host system and the external devices can filter IO port connections based on configurable rules. When new devices are connected to the USB filter the type of device is determined. Using an allow list a connection determination is made for the device.\n\nSome implementations detect when a device is connected in order to authorize the connection against a list of approved devices, in some cases by device type. For example, if the device is determined to be a storage device, then the contained files and executables are examined to more accurately identify the device type.\n\nTypes of restrictions that may be applied:\n- Device connection\n- Device command filtering\n- Device file system read or write restrictions\n\n## Considerations\n * Agent software will need to be installed on host systems\n * Configurations for allow/deny for devices and files will need to be maintained",

Also, if a new process was started before a process initiated by the device (ex. during boot) and that new process was not initiated by a user (which can be determined by examining process parameters such as type of process, its creator, source, etc.) the process is identified as suspicious.\n\nFor example, Microsoft Word may block execution of any subprocess that is not in an approved path.\n\n## Considerations\n* Attackers may spoof the parent PID (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1502/), rendering such after-the-fact analysis on process lineage ineffective.\n* Processes may hide from various means of detection; an example on Linux is where a rootkit might remove key files for the process from its directory in /proc.\n* Zombie processes.",

User shells execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command line interface or remotely logs in (such as SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system (/etc) and the user’s home directory (~/) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use <code>/etc/profile</code> when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.",

This technique provides a method to embed a software security component into the deployed firmware which provides a near real-time monitoring hook. The exception handling code, in the firmware, is typically used to expose any detected vulnerabilities.\n\nThe injected software components provide a feature similar to intrusion detection systems for the firmware by detecting unauthorized modifications of the embedded firmware. The integrity of static code and firmware data are monitored continuously in the hosted devices. Comparisons are made to monitored elements like firmware memory addresses and data segments. Memory pages are scanned and if a modification is detected the software component may lock the page. This will protect subsequent attempted modifications to the firmware. The software component may utilize the exception handling code and thus be able to disclose the exact address of the modified memory.\n\nThe injected software components are inserted during the firmware imaging process. The injected software is assumed to have knowledge of both the embedded code and the current execution state of the host program. The injected software will monitor and alert, in near real-time, on potential suspicious activity. The injected code is run alongside of the embedded code in the host. The injected software operates as an independent entity and is not dependent on the host software.\n\nFinally, this technique may implement other countermeasure techniques as part of their analytical processes. These should be identified by referencing other countermeasure techniques directly as necessary.\n\n## Considerations\n* The firmware code will need to be modified and re-hosted on the device.\n* Exposing monitoring hooks to the injected code may introduce additional risk.",

Separate profiles may be created for each behavioral indicator, as well as for each time series of measurements, and aggregated to create an overall behavioral profile. An anomaly probability is determined from the behavioral profile and used to evaluate the data values of observables. Outlier data values which deviate from normal behavior by more than a predetermined probability threshold are identified for risk analysis as possible threats while inliers within the range of normal behavior are used to update the behavioral profile. Behavioral profiles are created for behavioral indicators based upon observables measured over predetermined time periods using algorithms employing statistical analysis approaches that work for any type of data distribution, and profiles are adapted over time using data aging to more closely represent current behavior. Algorithm parameters for creating profiles are based on the type of data, i.e., its metadata.",

One difference is what type of software is able to follow them:\n\n - Symbolic links are automatically resolved by the file system. Any software program, upon accessing a symbolic link, will see the target instead, whether the program is aware of symbolic links or not.\n\n - Shortcuts are treated like ordinary files by the file system and by software programs that are not aware of them. Only software programs that understand shortcuts (such as the Windows shell and file browsers) treat them as references to other files.\n\nAnother difference are the capabilities of the mechanism:\n\n - Microsoft Windows shortcuts normally refer to a destination by an absolute path (starting from the root directory), whereas POSIX symbolic links can refer to destinations via either an absolute or a relative path. The latter is useful if both the location and destination of the symbolic link share a common path prefix[clarification needed], but that prefix is not yet known when the symbolic link is created (e.g., in an archive file that can be unpacked anywhere).\n\n- Microsoft Windows application shortcuts contain additional metadata that can be associated with the destination, whereas POSIX symbolic links are just strings that will be interpreted as absolute or relative pathnames.\n\n- Unlike symbolic links, Windows shortcuts maintain their references to their targets even when the target is moved or renamed. Windows domain clients may subscribe to a Windows service called Distributed Link Tracking to track the changes in files and folders to which they are interested. The service maintains the integrity of shortcuts, even when files and folders are moved across the network.[14] Additionally, in Windows 9x and later, Windows shell tries to find the target of a broken shortcut before proposing to delete it.",

Domain generation algorithms (DGAs) are sometimes used to create a domain name automatically  that will resolve to C2 infrastructure, without directly coding the domains in question into the malicious code.\n* Another method analyzes information about domains that have been visited, including whether a domain name is longer than a common length,  if a dynamic DNS domain was visited, if a fast-flux domain was visited, and if a recently created domain was visited. These factors are used to develop a score and if that score is over a certain threshold, an alert is generated.\n* Collected malware samples can be executed in a virtual environment to identify network domains that are connected to during execution. The network domains are then generated into signatures to identity bad domains for other hosts.\n\nThis technique does not check for content hosted at the domain.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* DNS produces a large amount of traffic which can be resource-intensive to analyze in real time.\n* If a server is compromised, for example, as part of a watering hole attack, but the DNS information pointing to that server is not altered, this technique would not catch such an incident.",

When wmic.exe (or the schtasks API) is used to remotely create processes, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) to communicate with the the remote machine.\n\nAfter RPC authenticates, the RPC endpoint mapper opens a high port connection, through which the schtasks Remote Procedure Call is actually implemented. With the right packet decoders, or by looking for certain byte streams in raw data, these functions can be identified.\n\nWhen the command line is executed, it has the parent process of C:\\windows\\system32\\wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe.

Σ may be a human language alphabet, for example, the letters A through Z and other applications may use a binary alphabet (Σ = {0,1}) or a DNA alphabet (Σ = {A,C,G,T}) in bioinformatics.\n\nIn practice, the method of feasible string-search algorithm may be affected by the string encoding. In particular, if a variable-width encoding is in use, then it may be slower to find the Nth character, perhaps requiring time proportional to N. This may significantly slow some search algorithms. One of many possible solutions is to search for the sequence of code units instead, but doing so may produce false matches unless the encoding is specifically designed to avoid it.\n\n## References\n1.

The statistics may include number of bytes sent to and from, time of session initiation, packet size, or packet arrival time data.\n\n## Considerations\n\nComplex intranet VPNs or routing encapsulation may affect the detection analytics.

The system implements methodology for verifying or authenticating communications, especially between network security components thereby allowing those components to share information. In one embodiment, a system implementing an active firewall is provided which includes methodology for verifying or authenticating communications between network components (e.g., sensor(s), arbiter, and actor(s)), using cryptographic keys or digital certificates. Certificates may be used to digitally sign a message or file and, in a complementary manner, to verify a digital signature. At the outset, particular software components that may participate in authenticated communication are specified, including creating a digital certificate for each such software component. Upon detection by a sensor that an event of interest that has occurred in the computer network system, the system may initiate authenticated communication between the sensor component and a central arbiter (e.g., \"event orchestrator\") component, so that the sensor may report the event to the arbiter or \"brain.\" Thereafter, the arbiter (if it chooses to act on that information) initiates authenticated communication between itself and a third software component, an \"actor\" component (e.g., \"firewall\"). The arbiter may indicate to the actor how it should handle the event. The actor or firewall, upon receiving the information, may now undertake appropriate action, such as dynamically creating or modifying rules for appropriately handling the event, or it may choose to simply ignore the information.",

Although these events can be detected with command line analytics CAR-2013-08-001, it is possible for an adversary to use the API directly, via the Task Scheduler GUI or with a scripting language such as PowerShell. In this cases, an additional source of data becomes necessary to detect adversarial behavior. When scheduled tasks are created remotely, Windows uses RPC (135/tcp) to communicate with the Task Scheduler on the remote machine. Once an RPC connection is established (CAR-2014-05-001), the client communicates with the Scheduled Tasks endpoint, which runs within the service group netsvcs. With packet capture and the right packet decoders or byte-stream based signatures, remote invocations of these functions can be identified.\n\nCertain strings can be identifiers of the schtasks, by looking up the interface UUID of ITaskSchedulerService in different formats\n\n* UUID 86d35949-83c9-4044-b424-db363231fd0c (decoded)\n* Hex 49 59 d3 86 c9 83 44 40 b4 24 db 36 32 31 fd 0c (raw)\n* ASCII IYD@$621 (printable bytes only)\n\nThis identifier is present three times during the RPC request phase.

The metadata is used to build a connectivity graph of the network and identify groups of similar hosts that exhibit similar behavior. For each group of similar behavior identified, a baseline behavior pattern profile is developed. Network activity for a host within a group that deviates over a threshold from the baseline behavior patterns is identified as suspicious and an alert is generated.",

The method includes evaluating actions performed by each user against user behavioral models and business rules. As a result of the analysis, a subset of users may be identified and reported as having unusual or suspicious behavior. In response, the management may provide feedback indicating that the user behavior is due to the normal expected business needs or that the behavior warrants further review. The management feedback is available for use by machine learning algorithms to improve the analysis of user actions over time. Consequently, investigation of user actions regarding computer resources is facilitated and data loss is prevented more efficiently relative to the prior art approaches with only minimal disruption to the ongoing business processes.",

A behavior model is built for a user in the network based on the user's interactions with the network, wherein a behavior model for a user indicates client device(s), server(s), and resources used by the user. The user's behavior during a period of time is compared to the user's behavior model. A risk assessment is calculated for the period of time based at least in part on the comparison between the user's behavior and the user's behavior model, wherein any one of certain anomalies between the user's behavior and the user's behavior model increase the risk assessment.",

Values for a histogram category are along one axis and the number of times the value is received for the category is along another axis.

For this work, we employ established tools within a structured methodology for cyber resiliency analysis. Our model is focused on a strategic-level military scenario defined in a formal Request for Information (RFI) to industry and research partners by the NATO Multinational Cyber Defense Capability Development (MN CD2) Work Package 2 (WP2). We enhance this scenario with additional mission and operational context, and then build a mission dependency model for the enhanced scenario. It is anticipated that our mission dependency model will be part of an upcoming demonstration of cyber defense situational awareness capabilities in a NATO Communications and Information (NCI) Agency test environment, integrated with data sources that represent the operational military environment.",

The processor can determine a computational model based on the training model inputs. The computational model can receive an input vector and provide a corresponding feature vector. The processor can then locate a trial analysis region of a trial data stream based on the predetermined structure data and determine a trial model input. The processor can operate the computational model based on the trial model input to provide a trial feature vector, e.g., a signature.

Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for \"find\" or \"find and replace\" operations on strings, or for input validation.\n\n## Key Test Considerations\n\n- **External review of regular expressions**: Regular expressions used in rules should be reviewed by a independent developer SME.  Regex testing and visualization tools may be used to aid this review.  Back-tests for failure modes identified during the review shoud be developed.  Regular expressions are easy to get wrong and may appear to work on limited tests; small mistakes can lead to unintended misses and matches.]\n\n- **Processing Performance Review**: Review of resource-intensive rules may be necessary if system performance degraded.  Look for cases of “exponential backtracking”  Some regexes are computationally expensive.\n\n## References\n1. Regular expression. (2023, June 1). In _Wikipedia_.

One of the most common methods is via the Windows Service Control Manager (SCM), which allows authorized users to remotely create and modify services. Several tools, such as PsExec, use this functionality.\n\nWhen a client remotely communicates with the Service Control Manager, there are two observable behaviors. First, the client connects to the RPC Endpoint Mapper over 135/tcp. This handles authentication, and tells the client what port the endpoint--in this case the SCM--is listening on. Then, the client connects directly to the listening port on services.exe. If the request is to start an existing service with a known command line, the the SCM process will run the corresponding command.\n\nThis compound behavior can be detected by looking for services.exe receiving a network connection and immediately spawning a child process.",

Each partition then appears to the operating system as a distinct \"logical\" storage device that uses part of the actual device. System administrators use a program called a partition editor to create, resize, delete, and manipulate the partitions. Partitioning allows the use of different filesystems to be installed for different kinds of files. Separating user data from system data can prevent the system partition from becoming full and rendering the system unusable. Partitioning can also make backing up easier.

These days each household has at least one computer keyboard, making keystroke dynamics the easiest biometric solution to implement in terms of hardware.\n\nWith keystroke dynamics the biometric template used to identify an individual is based on the typing pattern, the rhythm and the speed of typing on a keyboard.

The results of the distributed host query are stored and merged on the server, and exported for display, reports, or security response.",

Each host has a host agent that analyzes file system activity and takes action based on policies configured on a server. The policies identify whether to block, log, allow, or quarantine actions such as file accesses and execution of executables. Examples of policies include:\n\n* Block/log execution of new executables and detached scripts (e.g., .exe or .bat)\n* Block/log reading/execution of new embedded content (e.g., macros in .doc)\n* Block/log installation/modification of Web content (alteration of content in .html or .cgi files)\n* Block/log execution of new files in an administratively defined 'class'; e.g., an administrator might want to block screen savers .scr, but not the entire class of executables .exe, .dll, .sys, etc . . .",

This does not match the normal cadence of input, and the device is disabled.\n\nInput to type the session user's name takes abnormally longer for each keystroke.  The system is locked to the password prompt screen.\n\nA system receives key press events from two different devices -- one device sends keystrokes after the other has been idle for a long time.\n\nA system receives physical input in a user session, while that user has sent input from a device located out of the country in the past hour.\n\nNetwork traffic is suddenly routed through a new external device, and nearly the same volume of network traffic is subsequently sent out the previously existing interface.  The new external device is disabled, and an alert is raised to investigate the network configuration for a potential compromise.\n\n\n## Considerations\n\nGiven some example of legitimate behavioral input patterns, attackers could mimic those input patterns, a technique which has been used in popular culture in the creation of Deepfake videos and [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com).",

The sender encrypts messages using the recipient's public key and the receipt decrypts the message using their private key. Standards that can be used to implement message encryption include S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) and PGP.\n### Symmetric Cryptography\nSymmetric encryption uses the same cryptographic key by both the sender and receiver to encrypt and decrypt a message. Asymmetric key exchange protocols such as Diffie-Hellman can be used to share the cryptographic key with the recipient.\n\n## Considerations\n- Separate configuration settings to enable message encryption are often needed for each messenger client (e.g. webmail, desktop client, mobile).\n- Continuous monitoring to ensure private keys are not compromised and the certificate authority (CA) is trusted.\n- Secure transfer of private keys between multiple devices.",

If the the conditions are met, then the rule will \"fire\" and some action will be taken, usually notifying a person or another system that the event being monitored needs further processing or attention.\n\n## Key Test Considerations\n\n- **Performance (Accuracy)** Identify instances in data where rule is expected to be triggered. Implement traceability and metrics for individual rule performance. Traceability of cases could be implemented as unit tests or as part of a fine-grained classification performance platform. For simple rule-based matching systems with many rules, individual rules may be unused or may create unusually high false positives (or false negatives relative to expectation.\n\n- **Performance (Computational)** Generate model performance measures (see Classification Performance Measures), esp. a confusion matrix for each rule and identify outliers and relative contribution of rule to overall performance.\n\n## References\n1.

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How It Works\n\nPointer Authentication (frequently referred to as PAC, although the technique is properly Pointer Authentication) is a security feature to provide protection against attackers with memory read/write access.  A Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) is a cryptographic hash or derivative computed on the value of a pointer and some additional context information which can then provide a cryptographically strong guarantee about the likelihood that a pointer has been tampered with by an attacker.\n\nAlthough pointers are 64 bits, most systems have a substantially smaller virtual address space, leaving unused bits in pointers that can store the value of the PAC, this can be done to reduce memory space requirements. One implementation is in ARMv8.3-A.  A PAC is computed over the 64-bit pointer value and a 64-bit context value.  Instructions are introduced to deal with pointers: one category to compute and insert the PAC into a pointer, another category to verify the pointer and invalidate the pointer if the PAC does not check, and a third category to remove the pointer and restore the original value without verifying.\n\nThe ARM standard specifies a cryptographic algorithm called QARMA-64 (designed by Qualcomm) to compute the signature, although this algorithm is not required.  The architecture provides for five secret 128-bit Pointer Authentication keys: two for instruction pointers, two for data pointers, and a general key for signing larger blocks of data.\n\n## Considerations\n\nIn the ARM implementation, the mechanisms above for manipulating PACS are provided, but it is up to the code developer to manage the keys for the cryptographic algorithm.\n\n\nA known potential limitation of PACs concerns signing gadgets. Under certain circumstances PACs can be bypassed by forcing the system to run a signing gadget which will allow the signing of arbitrary pointers to occur.",

In particular, by analyzing the STP data, ambiguity in determining switch uplink ports may be reduced. Specifically, the STP data can be used in conjunction with other topography data to provide Layer-2 connectivity for nodes on a network topology. Layer-2 address mapping tables are collected from a topology mapping, and STP data is collected, along with address translation tables (ARP) tables. Using this information, switches are identified using Layer-2 address tables. The STP data can be correlated by comparing data in switches, identifying switch ports directly connected to other switch ports, and eliminating direct switch-to-switch port connections from consideration for further Layer-2 node mappings.",

These logs can be accessed in a few different ways. While logged in, this command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable <code>HISTFILE</code>. When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called <code>~/.bash_history</code>. The benefit of this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in different sessions. Since everything typed on the command-line is saved, passwords passed in on the command line are also saved. Adversaries can abuse this by searching these files for cleartext passwords. Additionally, adversaries can use a variety of methods to prevent their own commands from appear in these logs such as <code>unset HISTFILE</code>, <code>export HISTFILESIZE=0</code>, <code>history -c</code>, <code>rm ~/.bash_history</code>.",

Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, which are described in more detail below.\n\n## Considerations:\n\nThere are many different types of classification algorithms for modeling classification predictive modeling problems.\n\nThere is no single theory on how to map algorithms onto problem types; instead, it is generally recommended that a practitioner use controlled experiments and discover which algorithm and algorithm configuration results in the best performance for a given classification task.\n\n## Key Test Considerations\n\n- **Machine Learning**:\n\n  - **Verify the dataset quality**: Check the data to make sure it is\n      free of errors.  Quantify the degree of missing values,\n      outliers, and noise in the data collection.  If the data quality\n      is low, it may be difficult or impossible to create models and\n      systems with the desired performance.\n\n  - **Verify development datasets are representative** of expected\n      operational environment and data collection means.  Compare\n      distributions of dataset features and labels with exploratory\n      data analysis and assess the difference in tests on training\n      data and tests on evaluation data (where the evaluation data\n      must be drawn from a representative dataset.)\n\n  - **Use software libraries**: and tools built for ML where possible, so\n      that the underlying code is verified by prior use.**\n\n  - **Diagnose model errors with domain SMEs**: Have problem domain\n    SMEs investigate model errors for conditions for which the model\n    may underperform and suggest refinements.\n\n- **Classification**:\n\n  - **Use Standard Classification Performance Measures**: Not all of\n      the following may be necessary, but should be considered for\n      both verification (developmental test) and operational test\n      stages use:\n\n    - **Accuracy**: The fraction of predictions that were corret.\n\n    - **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were correct.\n\n    - **Recall**: The proportion of actual positive cases identified correctly.\n\n    - **F-Measure**: Combines the preicion and recall into a single\n        score.  It is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.\n\n    - **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**: A ROC curve\n        shows the performance of a classification model at all\n        classification thresholds.  It graphs the True Positive Rate\n        over the False Positive Rate.\n\n    - **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**: This measures the\n        two-dimensional area under the ROC Curve.  AUC is\n        scale-invariant and classification-threshold invariant.\n\n    - **ROC TP vs FP points**: In addition to a specific AUC score,\n        the performance at points\n\n    - **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is a table layout that\n        allows the visualization of the performance of an\n        algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in\n        an actual class while each column represents the instances in\n        a predicted class, or vice versa. It is a special kind of\n        contingency table, with two dimensions (\"actual\" and\n        \"predicted\"), and identical sets of \"classes\" in both\n        dimensions (each combination of dimension and class is a\n        variable in the contingency table.)\n\n  - **Prediction Bias**: The difference between the average of the\n      predicted labels and the average of the labels in the data\n      set.  One should check for prediction bias when evaluating the\n      classifier's results. Causes of bias can include:\n\n    - **Noisy data set**: Errors in original data can as the\n      collection method may have an underlying bias.\n\n    - **Processing bug**: Errors in the data pipeline can\n      introduce bias.\n\n    - **Biased training sample (unbalanced samples)**: Model\n      parameters may be skewed towards majority classes.\n\n\t- **Overly strong regularization**: Model may be underfitting\n        model and too simple.\n\n\t- **Proxy variables**: Model features may be highly\n        correlated.\n\n  - **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Overfitting occurs when the the\n    model built corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular\n    set of data, and thus may fail to fit to predict additional data\n    reliably. An overfitted model is a mathematical model that\n    contains more parameters than can be justified by the data.\n    Underfitting occurs when the model built does adequately capture\n    the patterns in the data. As an example, a linear model will\n    underfit a non-linear dataset.\n\n## Platforms, Tools, or Libraries:\n\n- **Python**:\n\n  - **scikit-learn**: Is a free software machine learning library for\n      Python and includes features for classification.\n\n  - **TensorFlow**: is an end-to-end source machine learning\n    platform.\n\n  - **Keras**: is an open-source library that provides a Python API\n    designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks.\n\n  - **PyTorch**: Is a machine learning framework based on the Torch\n    library.\n\n- **R**:\n\n  - **caret**: Classification And REgression Training package contains\n      functions to streamline model training for complex regression\n      and classification problems.\n\n  - **randomForest**: Implementation of classification and regression\n      based on forest of trees.\n\n## References\n\n1.

In this defensive technique, metadata from collected network packet captures is extracted to categorize network sessions using known relay behaviors. Information such as the number of bytes sent to and from a potential internal relay host, time of session initiation, packet contents, packet size, flow direction, and packet arrival time statistics are used to categorize the sessions and identify relay behavior. This technique assumes that relay network connections' inter-packet arrival times exhibit a high degree of variance in comparison to standard client-to-server connections.

It is very common for some programs to spawn cmd.exe as a subprocess, for example to run batch files or windows commands.

The one-time password may be from a list provided in advance, sent via a channel such as SMS or HTTPS to an app, or a generated token.\n\nIn the case of a physical token which generates one-time passwords incrementally based on time elapsed, that token device need not be connected to the internet. In different implementations, an administrator of the system, or a user with additional verification, can adjust for clock skew between the token and the verification system as needed.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Compromise of delivery channel\n- SIM Swapping\n- Secure token visual compromise\n- Insecure delivery channel\n\n### Compromise of delivery device\nPhysical loss of One-time Password device.\n\n### Compromise of long-term backup codes\nThese are often provided in the form of a downloadable document with a regular name, which can be searched for in the case that the user forgets where they put them.

Since\ndetection is based on pattern matching, a signature modelling the attack must exist for the NIDS to detect it, and\nit is therefore only capable of detecting known attacks. This paper proposes a method to detect buffer overflow\nattacks by parsing the payload of network packets in search of shellcode which is the remotely executable\ncomponent of a buffer overflow attack. By analysing the shellcode it is possible to determine which system\ncalls the exploit uses, and hence the operation of the exploit. Current NIDS-based buffer overflow detection\ntechniques mainly rely upon specific signatures for each new attack. Our approach is able to detect previously\nunseen buffer overflow attacks, in addition to existing ones, without the need for specific signatures for each\nnew attack. The method has been implemented and tested for buffer overflow attacks on Linux on the Intel x86\narchitecture using the Snort NIDS.",

The true length of the actual transmission source address is hidden by adding blank bytes. Further, a 2nd bit field is added to a secret key saved locally in a remailer, and an extended secret key characteristic of the destination address is generated. Then, the compressed actual transmission source address is ciphered according to the data ciphering standards using the extended secret key characteristic of the destination address as a cipher key (S350). Further, the 2nd bit field is added to the ciphered and compressed actual transmission source address (S360).",

This process is continued iteratively until the final prediction is made by aggregating the previous predictions.\n\n## Considerations\nBoosting can be computationally expensive, prone to overfitting, and slower to train compared to other ensemble methods.\n\nThere are three main types of Boosting algorithms\n - Adaptive Boosting\nAdaptive Boosting (sometimes called AdaBoost) works by adding equal importance to each piece of a dataset and running it through the base learning algorithms. Every algorithm that errors, the boosting algorithm assigns a higher importance to. This continues until an acceptable level of confidence is reached.\n - Gradient Boosting\nGradient Boosting starts by training multiple models simultaneously to gather a strong estimate of strength to build new base learning algorithms.\n - XGBoosting\nXGBoosting is a scalable tree boosting model. Using decision trees, weight is assigned to each variable and put into a decision tree. Outputs that are classified by the algorithm as wrong or weak are put into a second decision tree and the results form a stronger model.\n\n## References\nSciencedirect. (n.d.).

      "d3f:definition": "Decision tree learning is a supervised learning approach used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. In this formalism, a classification or regression decision tree is used as a predictive model to draw conclusions about a set of observations.",
      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\nA decision tree starts with a root node, which does not have any incoming branches. The outgoing branches from the root node then feed into the internal nodes, also known as decision nodes. Based on the available features, both node types conduct evaluations to form homogenous subsets, which are denoted by leaf nodes, or terminal nodes. The leaf nodes represent all the possible outcomes within the dataset.\n\n## Considerations\n\nWhile the basic underlying model is that of a decision tree, the decision tree node criteria, and the method for identifying splits varies significantly depending on the learning algorithm selected (e.g., CART, ID3, C4.5, C5.0, CHAID, MARS.)  Extensions like linear and logistic trees can add additional expressiveness as well.\n\n## Key Test Considerations\n\n- **Machine Learning**:\n\n  - **Verify the dataset quality**: Check the data to make sure it is\n      free of errors.  Quantify the degree of missing values,\n      outliers, and noise in the data collection.  If the data quality\n      is low, it may be difficult or impossible to create models and\n      systems with the desired performance.\n\n  - **Verify development datasets are representative**: of expected\n      operational environment and data collection means.  Compare\n      distributions of dataset features and labels with exploratory\n      data analysis and assess the difference in tests on training\n      data and tests on evaluation data (where the evaluation data\n      must be drawn from a representative dataset.)\n\n   - **Use a variety of data sets**: where available and applicable, to\n      reflect different operating and environment conditions that are\n      likley to be be encountered.\n\n  - **Use software libraries**: and tools built for ML where possible, so\n      that the underlying code is verified by prior use.**\n\n  - **Diagnose model errors with domain SMEs**: Have problem domain\n    SMEs investigate model errors for conditions for which the model\n    may underperform and suggest refinements.\n\n- **Classification**:\n\n  - **Use Standard Classification Performance Measures**: Not all of\n      the following may be necessary, but should be considered for\n      both verification (developmental test) and operational test\n      stages use:\n\n    - **Accuracy**: The fraction of predictions that were corret.\n\n    - **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were correct.\n\n    - **Recall**: The proportion of actual positive cases identified correctly.\n\n    - **F-Measure**: Combines the preicion and recall into a single\n        score.  It is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall.\n\n    - **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**: A ROC curve\n        shows the performance of a classification model at all\n        classification thresholds.  It graphs the True Positive Rate\n        over the False Positive Rate.\n\n    - **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**: This measures the\n        two-dimensional area under the ROC Curve.  AUC is\n        scale-invariant and classification-threshold invariant.\n\n    - **ROC TP vs FP points**: In addition to a specific AUC score,\n        the performance at points\n\n    - **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is a table layout that\n        allows the visualization of the performance of an\n        algorithm. Each row of the matrix represents the instances in\n        an actual class while each column represents the instances in\n        a predicted class, or vice versa. It is a special kind of\n        contingency table, with two dimensions (\"actual\" and\n        \"predicted\"), and identical sets of \"classes\" in both\n        dimensions (each combination of dimension and class is a\n        variable in the contingency table.)\n\n  - **Prediction Bias**: The difference between the average of the\n      predicted labels and the average of the labels in the data\n      set.  One should check for prediction bias when evaluating the\n      classifier's results. Causes of bias can include:\n\n    - **Noisy data set**: Errors in original data can as the\n      collection method may have an underlying bias.\n\n    - **Processing bug**: Errors in the data pipeline can\n      introduce bias.\n\n    - **Biased training sample (unbalanced samples)**: Model\n      parameters may be skewed towards majority classes.\n\n    - **Overly strong regularization**: Model may be underfitting\n       model and too simple.\n\n    - **Proxy variables**: Model features may be highly\n       correlated.\n\n- **Supervised Learning**:\n\n  - **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Overfitting occurs when the the\n    model built corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular\n    set of data, and thus may fail to fit to predict additional data\n    reliably. An overfitted model is a mathematical model that\n    contains more parameters than can be justified by the data.\n    Underfitting occurs when the model built does adequately capture\n    the patterns in the data. As an example, a linear model will\n    underfit a non-linear dataset.\n\n  - **Sensitivity**: Perform N-fold Cross validation to indicate how\n    much sensitivity the algorithm has to data variation and to avoid\n    overfitting operational models.\n\n- **Decision Tree Learning**:\n\n  - **Sensitive to unbalanced classes**: Examine and determine target\n      class balance; decision tree learning algorithms are especially\n      sensitive to unbalanced target classes.\n\n  - **Consider decision boundaries**: Perform exploratory data\n      analysis to determine if decision boundaries lie alongaxes of\n      features. _Decision trees are ideal when decision boundaries can\n      be found that lie along axes of features._\n\n   - **Decision tree overfitting** may require tuning algorithm hyperparameters such as tree depth, max features used, max leaf nodes, etc.\n\n   - **Pruning** may result in a more robust model in real-word applications.\n\n   - **Missing values**: Inspect the data set to determine if there\n     are missing values and select a means to address them, either by\n     choosing an algorithm that works well or a way to impute the\n     value or eliminate the missing values in the data sensors or\n     pipeline.\n\n## Platforms, Tools, or Libraries\n\n- **scikit-learn**: includes tree algorithms for ID3, C4.5, C5.0, and CART.\n\n- **Weka**: includes J48 (C4.5), SimpleCart (CART), Logistic Model Trees, Naive Bayes Trees, and more.\n\n### Validation Approach\n- Use operationally relevant data across the range of application's operating environment.\n- Incorporate some kind of continuous validation to address concept drift and the need to retrain the model and/or check data quality.\n\n## References\n1.

Mismatches are counted and if the number of mismatches exceeds a certain threshold it is an indication of unauthorized activity and a security response action is performed.\n\n## Considerations\nIf the threshold for detecting a stack anomaly is low, it may not detect a return-oriented attack with just one gadget, such as a return-to-libc or return-to-plt attack.  Additionally, this technique may not detect JOP (Jump-oriented programming), as the return instruction is not executed.",

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\nProcesses are managed by the operating system kernel.  Different operating system kernels manage the creation and termination of processes in a different manner, and expose this functionality via the kernel API.\n\nA running process might be terminated to mitigate its immediate effects if it is exhibiting anomalous, unauthorized, or malicious behavior; such as after detecting anomalous behavior via <a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:AdministrativeNetworkActivityAnalysis\" rdf:about=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#AdministrativeNetworkActivityAnalysis\">Administrative Network Activity Analysis</a>, after a failed check from <a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:StackFrameCanaryVerification\" rdf:about=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#StackFrameCanaryValidation\">Stack Frame Canary Validation</a>, or after <a href=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:SystemCallAnalysis\" rdf:about=\"https://d3fend.mitre.org/ontologies/d3fend.owl#SystemCallAnalysis\">System Call Analysis</a> finds an attempt to execute an unauthorized system call.\n\n### Proprietary technology\nSecurity software might use proprietary technology to terminate processes, instead of the system-provided functions.    Further research may provide specific detail on such methods used.\n\n### System-provided functions\n\n#### Windows tools\nIn Windows, `ExitProcess()` is used to send a signal to a process to request it to exit, and `TerminateProcess()` is used to force a process to exit.\n\nThe `taskkill` executable available in the cmd shell is used to kill a process, with the `/F` switch forcing termination as with `TerminateProcess()`.  In PowerShell, `Stop-Process` is used, which is aliased by default to `spps` and `kill`.  Processes started in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment may be terminated there with the `kill` command.\n\nIn some cases, existing drivers can also be leveraged to kill processes.\n\n#### Unix/Linux tools\nIn Unix-like systems, all process termination requests are handled using signals.  The `kill` function takes the Process ID and signal to send, and is accessible with the `kill` command.  Some shells have a `kill` builtin function which is separate than the `kill` binary, which can also kill background jobs in the shell and additionally perform the function faster, and can run from an existing instance of the shell if the process table is full.  The signal SIGTERM specifies that the process to terminate may invoke a handler that it has defined instead of terminating, and the signal SIGKILL forces immediate termination.\n\nThe related command `xkill` terminates the connection of a program to the X window server, after which the user process may decide to terminate itself; however, termination is not guaranteed as the process, which could be on the same or different host, could then run in a terminal or reconnect to a different X server on any host.  Emacs is such a program that would not terminate itself after its connection to the X server is terminated.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### Persistence Mechanisms\nTerminating a malicious process is not enough to stop an adversary that has already gained persistence in the host via any initial access mechanism, including through that process or another access mechanism.\n\n### Terminating Multiple Processes\nOn most operating systems, process termination operations typically occur independently of each other, without functionality provided to atomically terminate multiple processes.  If there are multiple malicious processes which can make system calls to spawn other processes once one of them is closed, user session termination or system restart might be required.\n\n### Process Access Permissions\nUsers must have permissions to kill the process.  On Unix-like systems, either root or the process user can kill the process.  On Windows systems, process permissions are managed separately via process security tokens.\n\n### Process Resource Handles\n\n#### Terminating Processes with Open Resource Handles\n\nProcesses may have open resource handles, which could leave those resources in an undesired state if the process is forced to terminate.  As such, most operating systems provide a means to send a signal to a process to inform it to gracefully terminate, and on most of these operating systems, it is the typical first step used to terminate a process.\n\n#### Signal Traps\nAs the process may have open resource handles, commonly-used methods of process termination involve sending a signal to the process to terminate.\nOn Windows, the `ExitProcess()` function is used for this purpose.  Process instructions, as well as a third-party DLL can also cause the process to exit.\nOn Linux, the process is sent a signal on the occurrence of various events: when it loses the console, `SIGHUP`; when termination is requested, `SIGTERM`.  The processor then redirects execution to the function registered to handle the signal.\n\nTherefore, sending a signal to the process to ask it to terminate may not always work.\n\n##### Avoiding Signal Traps\n\nOn Unix-like systems, sending the `SIGKILL` signal for a process does not send a message to the process or invoke an implementation-defined handler; instead, it immediately does not allow the process to execute any further processor instructions.   On Windows `TerminateProcess()` instead of `ExitProcess()` performs the equivalent.\n\n#### Hang on System Call Execution\n\nEven still, as the operating system kernel manages the processes, kernel code may block process signals, including those which cannot be trapped, and does in certain circumstances.  Signals are blocked and queued for the duration of the system call when interrupting the system call would result in a kernel invariant being violated, such as when an action results in a malformed data structure; this blocking is common for filesystem requests.  Such system calls can hang when a filesystem has gone offline, leading to a long-term uninterruptible sleep, represented in POSIX command `ps` output as D state.\nAny malicious system calls or system call handlers are issues of a much larger problem (a kernel-level rootkit) and the system should be redeployed entirely or restored from a backup known to be prior to compromise, and other systems accessible directly and indirectly from that one should also be examined.\n\nA process that is truly hung in a system call may prevent the system from shutting down and leave it in an unresponsive state; a hard power off is required.\n\nTo speed up the action of terminating a process in uninterruptible sleep, the process resource accesses (handles) could be analyzed.\n\nOn Linux, [`sync` followed by `echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt) is a safe way to free up some inactive resource handles.\n\n\n#### Kernel Processes and Threads\nThe kernel may not allow kernel processes, which are created via methods other than user-space processes, to be terminated.\n\n#### Other Code using the Process\n\nTerminating a shared library can lead to unexpected errors; such shared libraries have their own mechanisms for termination.\n\nOn Windows, a DLL is unloaded when the reference count of the library reaches 0.\n\n#### Zombie process\n\nAfter a process has been terminated, it may still take up an entry in the operating system process table until another event occurs.\n\n##### Windows\nIn Windows, a process object is deleted when the last handle to the process is closed.\n\n##### Linux\nIn Linux, a process is removed from the process table when it is reaped by its parent process.  If the parent terminates, historically the parent has been changed to pid 1; however, in the Linux kernel 3.4 and above, processes can set a different process as the subreaper using the `prctl()` system call.\n\nZombie processes and hung processes could be resolved with a restart of the system.\n\n#### System restart\nFinally a system restart might be required to kill a process.\nSystems which are only accessible via a remote in-band connection may become inaccessible if a process termination operation that is necessary for reboot does not complete.\n\n### Subsystems\nProcesses that are started in a subsystem might not be fully terminated if they are terminated using the command for that subsystem.  For example, in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), processes started and terminated via WSL calls such as with the `kill` command in Bash may still have an entry in the Windows process table.",

If the IP address(es) are in a range included in the blacklist, then the query is dropped.\n\n## Considerations\n- The blacklist will have to be maintained and will need to be kept up to date with identified maintenance cycles to ensure lists are not stale.\n- DNS query traffic can be transmitted over many different protocols, which presents a challenge to implementing methods to extract all DNS query IP address value(s).\n  - DNS has historically used UDP port 53, with TCP port 53 instead used for responses over 512 bytes or after a lack of response over UDP.\n  - Usage of new protocols to provide confidentiality for DNS traffic, such as DoH (DNS over HTTPS) and DoT (DNS over TLS), complicates collection of the IP address(es) in DNS queries. These protocols have often been enabled in browser settings transparently after a browser update, with DNS queries proxied over one of these cryptographic protocols through a specified host.",

Such inspection can detect intrusion, malware, and fraud, and can conduct troubleshooting, forensics, and performance monitoring. For these organizations, TLS inspection may serve as both a standard practice and a critical component of their threat detection and service assurance strategies.",

If the system detects risky behavior after log-in, it can take remedial action such as ending the entity's session, curtailing the entity's privileges, or notifying a human administrator.",

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\nFor propositions such as \"Socrates is a man\", one can have expressions in the form \"there exists x such that x is Socrates and x is a man\", where \"there exists\" is a quantifier, while x is a variable. This distinguishes it from propositional logic, which does not use quantifiers or relations.\n\nThe term \"first-order\" distinguishes first-order logic from higher-order logic, in which there are predicates having predicates or functions as arguments, or in which quantification over predicates, functions, or both, are permitted.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- Advantages:\n-- First-order logic is more expressive than propositional logic; one can talk about objects and their properties, relations between objects.\n-- First-order logic is able to make use of variables and quantifiers (e.g., \"for all\" and \"exists\".)\n-- First-order logic supports power forms of reasoning, such as inferring the properties of an unknown object from the properties of known objects.\n\n- Disadvantages:\n-- First-order logic is more difficult to learn and use than propositional logic, due to its greater complexity.\n-- First-order logic is also less tractable than propositional logic in many cases; reasoning about quantifiers and variables adds complexity.\n-- First-order logic can be difficult to apply in practice, due to the need to find appropriate axioms and rules for each application.\n\n### Verification Approach\n\n- Automated theorem provers can assist in formal verification, performing automated reasoning over system modeled in first-order logic and explore a complete space of system behaviors\n- First-order logic may be more expressive than necessary for many types of problems and may be more difficult to verify by SMEs.\n- Theorem provers based in FOL are capable of use in software verification tasks, but an SMT solver such as Z3 might be more appropriate.\n- Defining a set of competency questions (i.e., query use cases for a first-order logic ontology) can help scope the logic required for a complete solution.\n\n### Validation Approach\n\n- Domain SMEs should be identified to review the analytics results and compare them to expected results for a given input.\n- Where possible, an outside team of SMEs should inspect the formal logic specification of a system against its stated requirements and suitability to address its domain problem sets.\n- Defining a set of competency questions and the expected results provides one means of validation.\n\n## References\n\n1.

The method includes accessing host configuration information of a host and querying a vulnerability database based on the host configuration information. The method further includes receiving a list of vulnerabilities and accessing a plurality of vulnerability scores. The list of vulnerabilities corresponds to vulnerabilities of the host. Vulnerabilities can be removed from the list based on checking for installed fixes corresponding to vulnerability. A composite risk score can then be determined for the host a nd each software product of the host based on the plurality of vulnerability scores. An aggregate risk score can then be determined for the host and each software product of the host based on the plurality of vulnerability scores.",

These signatures typically match against specific byte sequences, packet header information, or protocol anomalies indicative of known threats.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n* Packet Capture: Network traffic is captured on an interface or port, resulting in a stream of raw packets.\n* Preprocessing: The captured packets are preprocessed, cleaning and normalizing the data for efficient analysis.\n* Signature Matching: Each packet is compared against a database of signatures using dedicated engines.\n\n## Considerations\n\n### False Negatives\n\nNetwork signature analysis is susceptible to generating false negatives. These occur when malicious activity evades detection due to limitations in the signature-based approach. Here are some common causes:\n\n* Evolving threats: Attackers frequently modify their tactics, rendering existing signatures ineffective against new variants.\n* Obfuscation: Attackers may disguise malicious content using encryption, encoding, or other techniques to bypass signature detection.\n* Limited visibility: Signatures rely on specific patterns. If crucial information is encrypted or hidden, the signature might miss the threat.\n* Zero-day attacks: By definition, new and unknown attacks lack corresponding signatures, allowing them to pass undetected.\n\n### False Positives\n\nNetwork signature analysis is susceptible to generating false positives. These occur when the signature analysis triggers an alert for benign traffic. Common causes include:\n\n* Overly broad signatures: Rules designed to be too general might match harmless activities, generating false alarms.\n* Network misconfigurations: Improperly configured devices or legitimate network activity can mimic malicious patterns, triggering false positives.\n* Data errors: Corrupted or incomplete network data can lead to misinterpretations and false alerts.\n\n",

Certificates or public keys can be pinned after a trusted connection has been established or the pinning can be preloaded in an application, which is the preferred method for mobile applications.\n\nPinning can take the form of certificate pinning or public key pinning.\n\n## Forms of Pinning\n* Certificate Pinning (CP) allows for the client to verify the X.509 certificate with a preloaded certificate. Typically, this is involves storing a hash of the certificate and using the stored hash for comparison to the hash of the certificate submitted during the SSL handshake.\n\n* Public Key Pinning (PKP) requires the extraction of a public key from server's certificate. The stored public key is compared to the server's presented public key. A public key is expected to rotate less frequently than an X.509 certificate and is generally favored over certificate pinning.\n\nAn extension of PKP is Subject Public Key Information Pinning (SPKI) includes public key pinning plus additional information for SSL connections. The additional information can include preferred algorithms.\n\n## Considerations\n\n* With pinned certificates whenever a server updates its certificate, the pinned certificates will also need to be updated\n* With pinned public keys the extracted key may be subject to key refresh policies but much less frequently\n* Servers can become unavailable if pinned objects are set and not updated with the rotated identities. This may require a pinning strategy to be developed.\n* The application of this technique within web browser applications has been [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning) by  popular web browser developers. They now favor certificate analysis via public certificate transparency logs, and the EXPECT-CT HTTP header.",

In some embodiments, heuristic botnet detection includes monitoring network traffic to identify suspicious network traffic; and detecting a bot based on a heuristic analysis of the suspicious network traffic behavior using a processor, in which the suspicious network traffic behavior includes command and control traffic associated with a bot master. In some embodiments, heuristic botnet detection further includes assigning a score to the monitored network traffic, in which the score corresponds to a botnet risk characterization of the monitored network traffic (e.g., based on one or more heuristic botnet detection techniques); increasing the score based on a correlation of additional suspicious behaviors associated with the monitored network traffic (e.g., based on one or more heuristic botnet detection techniques); and determining the suspicious behavior is associated with a botnet based on the score.",

      "d3f:kb-abstract": "When AT.exe is used to remotely schedule tasks, Windows uses named pipes over SMB to communicate with the API on the remote machine. After authentication over SMB, the Named Pipe “ATSVC” is opened, over which the JobAdd function is called. On the remote host, the job files are created by the Task Scheduler and follow the convention C:\\Windows\\System32\\AT<job\\_id>. Unlike CAR-2013-05-004, this analytic specifically focuses on uses of AT that can be detected between hosts, indicating remotely gained execution.\n\nThis pipe activity could be discovered with a network decoder, such as that in wireshark, that can inspect SMB traffic to identify the use of pipes. It could also be detected by looking for raw packet capture streams or from a custom sensor on the host that hooks the appropriate API functions. If no network or API level of visibility is possible, this traffic may inferred by looking at SMB connections over 445/tcp followed by the creation of files matching the pattern C:\\Windows\\System32\\AT\\<job_id\\>.",

Nonstandard terminal sessions and abnormal behaviors are analyzed in this technique. Abnormal behavior detection includes analysis of user input patterns in the real-time session, keyboard output and packet inspection.\n\n### Network Traffic Inspection\nNetwork traffic from internal hosts is the main concern and focus for the traffic inspection. The network traffic is collected into inspection groups. The groups of traffic are assembled into distinct pair flows (outbound/inbound) and the pair flows are further divided into sessions. Only sessions originated inside of the network are considered for the inspection. Traffic inspection includes analysis to determine if a human is involved in the session exchanges. Time-based statistics are captured for each session being analyzed by the detection engine.\n\n### Algorithm Analysis Description\nAnalysis algorithms look for patterns in the network traffic captured from the session data.  A detection engine groups the session traffic data, between the hosts, into rapid exchange instances. Analysis of rapid exchange traffic patterns can lead to the discovery of abnormal behavior which is indicative of a compromised internal host. The analysis algorithms look for patterns in the traffic which correlate to known activity (e.g., relay attacks, bot activity, bitcoin mining). Some metrics used during inspection include the following.\n\n* Number of rapid-exchange instances\n* Time interval between packets\n* Fixed cadence of traffic\n* Rhythm and direction of the initiation of instances\n* Volume of data flowing from internal to external controlling host\n* Data transfer characteristics\n* Variability in length of silent periods\n\n## Considerations\n* Full packet capture is required which can be process intensive to analyze\n* Attackers that move low and slow may blend in with existing traffic resulting in false negatives",

Active learning addresses this labeling bottleneck by asking an oracle (e.g., a human annotator) to label selected unlabeled instances.

Firmware analysis applies to mutable firmware and immutable read-only memory (ROMs).\n\nFirmware in deployed network devices is typically not analyzed and monitored for vulnerabilities and thus is subject to potential attacks. This technique makes use of known and measured behavioral attributes, including timing attributes, of analyzed firmware on deployed devices.\n\nA behavioral method that employs known timing measurements may use the timing results from a challenge and response protocol to detect the presence of malware in embedded firmware. Firmware device timing measurements are made, specific to the installed device, and are used in the verifying function.\n\nThe original firmware image is modified by injecting a monitoring software component into the embedded firmware code. The injected software components will allow for a software root of trust, the challenge and response protocol, to be implement in the firmware.\n\nA challenge-response is issued and includes a nonce so that replays are not allowed. The firmware will calculate a checksum over all of memory, including the nonce, and return the result. The verification system will compare the computed checksum and the time it took for the computation of the checksum to determine if the firmware has been modified.\n\n## Considerations\n* The firmware code will need to be modified to include the behavioral monitoring functionality.\n* This technique is sensitive to the device the embedded firmware is hosted on and it is expected that the devices and firmware will need to be profiled and analyzed to determine timing estimation.\n* This technique is not expected to be one hundred percent correct as you would expect in a hardware root of trust solution and may require some tuning.",

In Email, Sender Policy Framework (SPF), Domain Key Identified Email (DKIM) or Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) are used to validate sender domain ownership.\n\n### SPF\nSPF protocol allows for mail domain owners to specify the mail servers they use when sending email. SPF requires the use of SPF records published in the Domain Name System (DNS). The records record the authorized IPs for email senders. SPF uses the return-path address for domain IP identification. Email that is forwarded may cause the return-path validation problems.\n### DKIM\nDKIM also uses a record entry in DNS for authentication but does not rely on the simple return-path for validation. A signature header is added to email and encryption is used for security. This adds an additional layer of complexity and requires that DKIM servers be configured identified cryptographic signatures. The additional complexity results in a validation process that can survive complex routing of emails.\n\n### DMARC\nDMARC is an email policy and authentication protocol that seeks to ensure that the \"From\" field of emails is not spoofed. DMARC makes use of both SPF records and DKIM published key validation. DMARC also has a decision policy framework, contained in a DMARC record, for handling of rejected email. The DMARC framework also updates DMARC domains with authentication statues for allowed senders of that domain.\n\n## Considerations\n- Additional work is required to ensure that all SPF, DKIM and DMARC records are current and up to date.\n- Maintenance of DKIM signing keys is needed.\n- Using SPF without DKIM and DMARC verifies the Return-Path domain however does not prevent spoofing of the displayed From: address.\n- Parts of an email that are not signed or verified by email authentication methods, such as the message body or the header To: and Subject: fields, can be altered or modified.\n- Email message authentication does not replace the need to do email content analysis since executables, attachments, or links or other parts of the email beyond the sender domain are not verified.",

A performance monitoring unit is used to monitor system calls and to gather information about each system call. The information is gathered upon interrupting the system call and can include system call type, parameters, and information about the calling thread/process, in order to determine whether the system call was generated by malicious software code. Potentially malicious software code is nullified by a malicious code counter-attack module.",

Most buffer overflows overwrite memory from lower to higher memory addresses, so in order to overwrite the return pointer (and thus take control of the process) the canary value must also be overwritten. This value is checked to make sure it has not changed before a routine uses the return pointer on the stack.

This functionality is provided via the Windows API CreateRemoteThread. Both Windows and third-party software use this ability for legitimate purposes. For example, the Windows process csrss.exe creates threads in programs to send signals to registered callback routines. Both adversaries and host-based security software use this functionality to inject DLLs, but for very different purposes. An adversary is likely to inject into a program to evade defenses or bypass User Account Control, but a security program might do this to gain increased monitoring of API calls. One of the most common methods of DLL Injection is through the Windows API LoadLibrary.\n\nAllocate memory in the target program with VirtualAllocEx\nWrite the name of the DLL to inject into this program with WriteProcessMemory\nCreate a new thread and set its entry point to LoadLibrary using the API CreateRemoteThread.\nThis behavior can be detected by looking for thread creations across processes, and resolving the entry point to determine the function name. If the function is LoadLibraryA or LoadLibraryW, then the intent of the remote thread is clearly to inject a DLL. When this is the case, the source process must be examined so that it can be ignored when it is both expected and a trusted process.",

This means that even if a server certificate is updated correctly, intermediate certificates can expire and the trust chain is not maintained. This can cause services to become unavailable.",

ROP\nexploits are facilitated mainly by the lack of complete\naddress space randomization coverage or the presence\nof memory disclosure vulnerabilities, necessitating additional ROP-specific mitigations.\nIn this paper we present a practical runtime ROP exploit prevention technique for the protection of thirdparty applications. Our approach is based on the detection of abnormal control transfers that take place during\nROP code execution. This is achieved using hardware\nfeatures of commodity processors, which incur negligible runtime overhead and allow for completely transparent operation without requiring any modifications to\nthe protected applications. Our implementation for Windows 7, named kBouncer, can be selectively enabled for\ninstalled programs in the same fashion as user-friendly\nmitigation toolkits like Microsoft's EMET. The results of\nour evaluation demonstrate that kBouncer has low runtime overhead of up to 4%, when stressed with specially\ncrafted workloads that continuously trigger its core detection component, while it has negligible overhead for\nactual user applications. In our experiments with in-thewild ROP exploits, kBouncer successfully protected all\ntested applications, including Internet Explorer, Adobe\nFlash Player, and Adobe Reader.",

For a domain name that is associated with an on-line threat, the RPZ application determines a threat specification that describes a characteristic of the on-line threat. The RPZ application then generates an alias based on the domain name and the threat specification. Subsequently, the RPZ application generates a domain name system (DNS) resource record that maps the domain name to the alias, includes the resource record in the RPZ, and transmits the RPZ to a DNS name server that implements the RPZ. Upon receiving a DNS query associated with the domain name, the DNS name server generates a DNS response based on the alias.

For Web searching, a transaction log is an electronic record of interactions that have occurred during a searching episode between a Web search engine and users searching for information on that Web search engine.\n\nMany operating systems, software frameworks and programs include a logging system. A widely used logging standard is syslog, defined in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC 5424).

It allows for enumerating, and reading from and writing to file shares for a remote computer. Although it is heavily used by Windows servers for legitimate purposes and by users for file and printer sharing, many adversaries also use SMB to achieve Lateral Movement. Looking at this activity more closely to obtain an adequate sense of situational awareness may make it possible to detect adversaries moving between hosts in a way that deviates from normal activity. Because SMB traffic is heavy in many environments, this analytic may be difficult to turn into something that can be used to quickly detect an APT. In some cases, it may make more sense to run this analytic in a forensic fashion.

By ensuring that the driver is the first driver initialized, the components enable the driver to launch the kernel-mode component before other drivers are initialized. The library component may also determine whether another driver is to be initialized before the kernel-mode component driver, may ensure that kernel-mode component driver is initialized first, and may alert the kernel-mode component.

To ensure the driver is initialized first, a dependent DLL associated with the driver is configured to be processed before other dependent DLLs. The dependent DLL can be configured to be processed first by various methods, for example if processing is done in alphabetical order, changing its name to be processed first. The dependent DLL, once processed, executes a number of operations to ensure the driver associated with the agent is initialized first. Furthermore, if the initialization order is modified, an alert is provided to the kernel-mode component that notifies the kernel-mode component it was not first and the order had to be altered. It can then take additional actions such as additional monitoring or remediation.",

The system is connected to a plurality of user devices coupled to an enterprise's network. The system receives via an interface an electronic notification of at least one event in the operating system of the computer. The system then analyzes the at least one event. The system then generates a causality chain for the at least one event respective of the analysis. The causality chain comprises all the threads that attributed to the at least one event in a chronological order. The system then identifies a main thread that started the causality chain that led to the at least one event. Then, the system determines whether the main thread is associated with malicious software. Upon determination that the main thread is associated with malicious software, the causality chain is marked as infected.",

      "d3f:definition": "Agglomerative Clustering is a type of hierarchical clustering method where data points are grouped together based on similarity. Initially, each data point is treated as an individual cluster, and then in successive iterations, the closest clusters are merged until only one large cluster remains or until a specified stopping criterion is met.",
      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\nAgglomerative clustering starts with each data point as its own cluster. The algorithm then iterates, identifying the two clusters that are closest to each other based on a defined distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan). These two clusters are then merged into a single cluster. This process continues iteratively, merging the closest pairs of clusters in each step until all data points are merged into a single cluster or until other stopping criteria are achieved. A dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram, can be used to represent the sequence of merges, providing a visual representation of the hierarchical structure of data.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- **Choice of Distance Metric**: The outcome can vary significantly depending on the chosen distance metric (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan).\n\n- **Scalability**: Agglomerative clustering can be computationally intensive for large datasets.\n\n- **Sensitivity**: The method can be sensitive to outliers, which might affect the quality of the clusters formed.\n\n## Key Test Considerations\n\n- **Unsupervised Learning**:\n\n  - **Number of Clusters**: Determine an optimal number of clusters using the dendrogram and techniques like the elbow method.\n\n- **Cluster Analysis**:\n\n    - **Silhouette Score**: Evaluates how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher silhouette score indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.\n\n    - **Dunn Index**: Measures the ratio between the smallest distance between observations not in the same cluster to the largest intra-cluster distance.\n\n- **Hierarchical Clustering**:\n\n    - **Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient**: Measures the correlation between the distances of points in feature space and their distances on the dendrogram. Helps assess the fidelity of the dendrogram in preserving pairwise distances between samples.\n\n- **Agglomerative Clustering**:\n\n    - **Linkage Criteria**: Test different linkage criteria (e.g., single, complete, average) to determine which produces the most cohesive clusters for the data at hand.\n\n  ## Platforms, Tools, or Libraries\n\n- **scikit-learn**:\n\n    - A versatile machine learning library in Python.\n\n    - The `AgglomerativeClustering` class in scikit-learn provides this functionality.\n\n- **SciPy**:\n\n    - A Python library used for scientific and technical computing.\n\n    - The `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` module provides functions for hierarchical and\n    agglomerative clustering, including the `linkage` and `dendrogram` functions.\n\n- **R**:\n\n    - The `hclust` function in the stats package provides agglomerative clustering.\n\n    - The `agnes` function in the `cluster` package offers a more extensive implementation.\n\n- **MATLAB**:\n\n    - Offers the `linkage` function for hierarchical agglomerative clustering and `dendrogram` for visualization.\n\n- **Weka**:\n\n    - A collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks.\n\n    - The `HierarchicalClusterer` class provides an implementation of agglomerative clustering.\n\n## References\n\n1.

A modem modulates one or more carrier wave signals to encode digital information for transmission and demodulates signals to decode the transmitted information. The goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded reliably to reproduce the original digital data. Modems can be used with almost any means of transmitting analog signals from light-emitting diodes to radio. A common type of modem is one that turns the digital data of a computer into modulated electrical signal for transmission over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital data.",

The logs allow users to only append certificates and never to delete or modify the log entries. The logs use Merkle Tree Hashes to ensure they have not been tampered with. The logging service also allows for public auditing by any user.\n\nThe logging service, upon receipt of a certificate to log, will respond with a signed certificate timestamp (SCT). The SCT guarantees the certificate will be added to the log within the time specified. The SCT must be present with the certificate during a TLS handshake.\n\n* Certificate Monitoring\nCertificate monitoring, of the logs, is typically done by the CA and they watch for suspicious certificate logging and unusual certificates or extensions or permissions. Monitors are also responsible for verifying the logs are accurate and public.\n\n* Certificate Auditors\nLog integrity is verified by log auditors. Auditors make use of log proofs are used to validate the cryptographic hashes (Merkle Trees) that the log employs are consistent. In order to ensure consistency throughout multiple monitors and auditors, sharing a common logging service, gossip protocol is employed.\n\n### Phishing domain name analysis\n* A curated corpus of known benign domains and phishing domain names is used as training text for machine learning. Through the use of feature set extraction, vectors labels are created with scoring to indicated if they are considered benign or phishing domains.\n\n* A stream of new or updated SSL certificates with fully qualified domain names (FQDN) is analyzed against the feature vectors and a predictive model determines a score for the domains. The scoring considers distance measures such as Levenshtein distance to help in determining the final label score. Supervised learning is also employed using the curated domains of benign and phishing domains.\n\n* Subdomain phishing analysis, prepending a trusted domain to a phishing domain, and regular expression comparisons  are also used in the label scoring model. A tunable measure is used to determine the threshold for alerting. This measure helps to balance between precision and recall measures.\n\n## Considerations\n* Some entity will need to run the logging service and a trusted entity is preferred.\n* Certificate Authorities will likely need to monitor the logging service for consistency.\n* Certificate revocation is unchanged and remains outside of Certificate Transparency, but certificates needing to be revoked are visible.\n* Technique dependent of reliable feed of new and updated certificates\n* Some certificate authorities allow for certificates to be registered with wildcards in the FQDN and thus will fail some of the subdomain scoring\n* Phishing HTTP domains will not be discovered",

This process may allow for the removal of specific types of malware, such as fileless malware, and can also prevent further damage, for example, if the system is part of a botnet.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- If the attacker has achieved persistence techniques, this technique may not be effective\n- Compromised systems may not respond to remote commands to shutdown or reboot, requiring physical intervention.\n- Shutting down a system will usually result in the memory losing its state which can be useful in forensic activities so this should be considered when deciding to shutdown.\n- Shutting down or rebooting systems may disrupt access to computer resources for legitimate users.",

The predetermined collection of malicious behaviors are created based on analysis of families of malware in run time in a threat research facility. If a match is made an action is taken that can include isolating the computer on which the user interaction occurs and limiting network access to or from the computer.",

      "d3f:kb-article": "## How it works\n\n#### Memory\nCredentials may be stored in memory for a variety of reasons; on Windows, they may be stored in lsass.exe.  Once a credential dumper like mimikatz runs and dumps the memory of lsass.exe, the credentials of every account logged on since boot are potentially compromised.\nWhen such an event occurs, this analytic will give the forensic context to identify compromised users. Those users could potentially be used in later events for additional logons.\n\n\n#### Hard disk\nOperating System may cache a certain number of credentials onto the hard disk to use as a source of truth if it cannot contact the credential server.  In many versions of Microsoft Windows, the 10 most recent are cached by default; this setting can be changed in the Microsoft Management Console's Local Security Policy: ```Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Local Policy -> Security Options -> Interactive Logon: Number of previous logons to cache -> 0```  Here we are not concerned with the alteration of the credentials but the fact that they might be read.  If the attacker has physical access to the machine they are unlikely to be stopped from reading files on the filesystem.\n\"In the event that the domain controller is unavailable Windows will check the last password hashes that has been cached in order to authenticate the user with the system. These password hashes are cached in the following registry setting:\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SECURITY\\Cache\nMimikatz can retrieve these hashes if the following command is executed:\nlsadump::cache\" [1]\n\nThe Registry Hive, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SAM, which is stored in the supporting files %systemroot%\\System32\\Config\\{Sam,sam.log,sam.sav}, contains the SAM file.\n\nDC: This is stored in %systemroot%\\ntds\\ntds.dit. (https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/blog/default.aspx?d=10/2017)\n\nSometimes memory, which contains credentials, could get on the hard disk. Like with hiberfil.sys in Windows.  Equivalent on Linux\n\n\nIn Linux, an attacker could read the /etc/shadow file.\n\nReading from /proc directory: mimipenguin, many others.\n\n## Considerations\nEffective implementation requires identifying any location that could end up containing credentials, and detecting an method of potential access to a source of credential data.\n\n1. https://medium.com/blue-team/preventing-mimikatz-attacks-ed283e7ebdd5",
