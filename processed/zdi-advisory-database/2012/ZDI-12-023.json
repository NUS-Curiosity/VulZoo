    "description": "    This vulnerability allows attackers to remotely obtain domain credentials on vulnerable installations of CA Total Defense Suite UNC Management Web Service. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the App_Code.dll service listening by default on TCP ports 34444 and 34443 (SSL). The service allows a remote client to request encrypted domain credentials without authentication. The encryption lacks a salt allowing an attacker with a local installation of CA Total Defense Suite UNC Management Web Service to easily decrypt the credentials.\n  ",
    "addtionnal_details": "        We are pleased to confirm that all three vulns that were reported by Tipping Point were proactively closed as part of the Total Defense R12 SE3 (Build 831) release cycle.  This SE3 release is publicly shipping from our download links since December 5th, 2011.
