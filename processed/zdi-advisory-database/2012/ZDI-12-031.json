    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the mod_ipp apache module component of the iprint-server, which listens by default on 631/tcp. During the handling of get-printer-attributes requests containing a attributes-natural-language attribute cause a validation routine to be hit. When validating this parameter the contents of the attribute are copied, without validation, to a fixed length buffer on the stack.  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
