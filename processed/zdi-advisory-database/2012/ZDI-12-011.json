    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell Netware. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within the xnfs.nlm component which is used when handling NFS RPC requests. This process listens on UDP port 32779. When decoding the xdr encoded caller_name from an NLM_TEST procedure request the process uses the user supplied length as the bounds for its copy to a stack buffer. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the system.\n  ",
