User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within the handling of VML element positioning. When appending a VML element to a textArea element a reference to a cDispScroller object can be improperly freed. The object is can be reused, and due to this object being freed, a later allocation can be located in this memory region.  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
