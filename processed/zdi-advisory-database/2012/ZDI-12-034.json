    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows Media Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of ASX meta files. When the code within wmp.dll attempts to process the version string within a meta file, it copies it to a fixed-length buffer on the stack without checking that the destination can contain the input data. This can be abused remotely by attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the media application.\n  ",
