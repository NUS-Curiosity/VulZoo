    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application decodes video samples encoded with the RLE codec. When decompressing the sample, the application will fail to accommodate for the canvas the sample is rendered into. This can cause a buffer overflow and thus can be taken advantage of in order to gain code execution under the context of the application.\n  ",
