    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle's Java Runtime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application parses structures for a specific tag descriptor with a specific ICC color profile. When handling a field from this structure, the application will incorrectly check for signedness and then perform an operation on it. This will then get passed to an allocation. Immediately following this, the application will use a different size to initialize the allocation. This can lead to a controllable memory corruption which can be leveraged to achieve code execution under the context of the applicaiton.\n  ",
