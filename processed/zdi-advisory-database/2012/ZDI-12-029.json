User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within BB FlashBack Recorder.dll. Uninitialized pointers may be passed as arguments to InsertMarker() which in turn can allow an attacker to corrupt memory in a controlled fashion. This behavior can be exploited to remotely execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the browser.\n  ",
