    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of OpenView Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within ov.dll. When processing a user supplied file name for the textFile option, there exists an insufficient boundary check before supplying the value to a format string within _OVBuildPath, causing a stack overflow.
