    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Java Webstart handles the 'java-vm-args' parameter in the j2se tag within a jnlp file. Due to insufficient sanitation it is possible to add additional double quotes to the commandline argument string used to start a new java process. This can lead to remote code execution under the rights of the current user.\n  ",
