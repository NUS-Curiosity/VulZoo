    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of EMC Networker. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the way the indexd.exe handles rpc calls with opcode 0x1 for program 0x0005F3D9. While processing this message a user supplied string is copied into a fixed size stack buffer. This can result in a buffer overflow which can lead to remote code execution under the context of the current process. \n  ",
