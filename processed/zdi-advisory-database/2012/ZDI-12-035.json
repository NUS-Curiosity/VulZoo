    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required in that a target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. \nThe flaw exists within MSHTML, specifically the handling of an HTML time t:MEDIA element. A t:MEDIA element can be manipulated such that when the page is refreshed a reference to a freed CDispNode object remains allowing the repurpose of this region.  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
