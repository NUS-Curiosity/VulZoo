    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java Webstart. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within javaws.exe . Java Web Start does not safely handle double quotes that are placed anywhere except the beginning of certain property names in JNLP files. As a result, double quotes can be used to inject arbitrary command-line arguments into a javaw.exe process. Leveraging this would allow a remote attacker to execute code under the context of the user.\n  ",
