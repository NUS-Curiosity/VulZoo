    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM SPSS. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Render() method exposed by the ExportHTML.dll ActiveX control. This method causes a file to be written to an arbitrary path specified by the second argument (Output). The contents of the file can be controlled by manipulating the object members 'CssLocation', 'LayoutStyle' and 'EmbedCss'. The CssLocation member can be directed to a UNC path containing a file to be included in the file generated by the call to Render(). These behaviors can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.\n  ",
