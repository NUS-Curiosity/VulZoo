    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM SPSS. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the SaveDoc and PrintFile functions exposed by the VsVIEW6.ocx ActiveX control. The SaveDoc function causes a file to be created at an arbitrary path specified by the first argument (FileName). The file contents can be controlled by setting the 'Header' member and calling PrintFile() with the same path argument. These behaviors can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.\n  ",
