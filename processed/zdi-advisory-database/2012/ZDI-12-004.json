    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within the JP2Deco component which is used when handling an mjp2 sample. This sample format (JPEG2000) has a required COD marker segment (0xff52) followed by a COD length value. When extracting the contents of this section the application subtracts from this length before passing it into a call to memcpy. A remote attacker can exploit this error to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user.\n  ",
