    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM SPSS SamplePower. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the C1sizer.ocx ActiveX Control. This component performs insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data on the TabCaption property which results in memory corruption. An attacker can leverage this situation to execute code under the context of the user running the browser.\n  ",
