    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Webkit. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Webkit implements string.concat(). When concatenating multiple strings the function fails to properly check for overflows and as such is vulnerable to heap corruption. This could result in remote code execution under the context of the current program.\n  ",
