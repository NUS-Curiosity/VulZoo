    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the callbacks associated with ToolButton objects.  A reference to the ToolButton object is kept when executing a callback which can lead to a use-after-free scenario if the callback removes the ToolButton object.  An attacker can leverage this situation to execute code under the context of the user.\n  ",
