    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing a mjpeg movie with an improper jpeg frame size via the stsd atom. When processing the movie, the size of the destination buffer for jpeg contents is specified separately from the JPEG size. This can lead to memory corruption that can be leveraged to achieve code execution under the context of the process.\n  ",
