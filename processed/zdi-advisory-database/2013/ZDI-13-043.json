    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific issue is due to the way Internet Explorer handles elements associated to the saveHistory behavior and an onload event handler. The process can be made to re-use a freed object. This can lead to a use-after-free scenario which can be leveraged to execute code under the context of the user running the browser.\n  ",
