    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell Groupwise Messenger. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of specific commands passed to the messenger via the nim:// protocol handler. By crafting a page with a large filename parameter within an import command, a stack-based buffer overflow can be made to occur. This can be exploited by an attacker to execute remote code under the context of the Administrator account. \n  ",
