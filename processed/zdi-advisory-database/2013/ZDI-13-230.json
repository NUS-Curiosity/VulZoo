    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the improper bounds checking of a U3D PCX external texture.   The application performs insufficient bounds checking on user supplied data passed in which results in a heap buffer overflow. An attacker can leverage this situation to execute code under the context of the user running the process.\n  ",
