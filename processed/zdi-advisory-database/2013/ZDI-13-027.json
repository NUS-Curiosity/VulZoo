    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of TextRange objects. The issue lies in the usage of Range.moveToElementText and Range.collapse. By manipulating a TextRange object an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this to gain code execution in the context of the current user.\n  ",
