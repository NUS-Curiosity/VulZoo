User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of VST files.  The issue lies in the failure to validate a length specified by the file before using it as a size in a memcpy.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
