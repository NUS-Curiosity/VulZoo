    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific issue is due to the way anchor elements are handled. When parsing occurs, the process can be made to delete an object resulting is a dangling pointer. The process can be later forced to reuse this pointer resulting in a use-after-free condition. An attacker can leverage this situation to execute code under the context of the user running the browser.\n  ",
