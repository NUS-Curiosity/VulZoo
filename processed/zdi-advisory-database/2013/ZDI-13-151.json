    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the java.awt.image.ShortComponentRaster class.  The issue lies in the failure to properly verify that a buffer is large enough prior to copying data into it.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
