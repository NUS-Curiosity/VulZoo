    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP Data Protector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within crs.exe which listens by default on a random TCP port. When parsing opcode 211, the process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length stack buffer. A remote attacker can abuse this to execute remote code under the context of the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
