    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within styles being applied to elements on the DOM causing a negatively positioned CDispNode to be freed.  The process can be later forced to reuse this object resulting in a use-after-free condition. An attacker can leverage this situation to execute code under the context of the user running the browser.\n  ",
