    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of MySQL with yaSSL. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the yaSSL library that is optionally used by MySQL for SSL communication. There exists an off-by-one overflow that is repeatedly performed during the SSL handshake.  This can result in memory corruption that can lead to remote code execution under the context of the current process.\n  ",
