    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP LeftHand Virtual SAN Appliance. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within the hydra service, specifically with the hel.module component. This process listens on TCP port 13838. When attempting to service a disk diag request the process fails to properly verify the length of the accompanying request paramemeters before copying to a local buffer.
