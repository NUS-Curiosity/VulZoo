    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of CObjectElement objects.  The issue lies in the usage of URL references when defining a CSS cursor property.  By manipulating a document's stylesheet an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
