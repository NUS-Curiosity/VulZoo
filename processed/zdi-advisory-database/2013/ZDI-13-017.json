    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP LeftHand Virtual SAN Appliance. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within the hydra component which listens by default on TCP port 13841. The hydra daemon is responsible for management remote operations such as user creation, snapshots, etc. A client communicating directly with this service can supply a request to the server that yields a response with user credentials including hashed passwords to be disclosed. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
