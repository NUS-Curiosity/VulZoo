    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft .NET Framework. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the System.Drawing.Imaging.EncoderParameters.ConvertToMemory() method inside the .NET Framework. The function allocates an array based on the value of the parameter this.param.Length and then uses a loop terminated by the same parameter to fill the array with data. If another thread changes the value of this.param.Length between the array creation and loop this can result in a heap buffer overflow that can lead to remote code execution under the context of the current program.\n  ",
