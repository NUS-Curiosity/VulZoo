    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ienipp.ocx ActiveX object. A vulnerability exists in the op-client-interface-version operation, which takes two strings as parameters.  When these strings are combined to create the response url, Novell iPrint copies this string to a fixed-length buffer on the stack. This can lead to memory corruption which can be leveraged to execute code under the context of the process.\n  ",
