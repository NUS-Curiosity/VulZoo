    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists due to insufficient checks during deserialization in the NativeJavaConstructor class that is part of the Rhino JavaScript Engine. This allows for the construction of otherwise privileged objects which can lead to remote code execution under the context of the current user.\n  ",
