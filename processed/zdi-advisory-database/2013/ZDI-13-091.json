    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Document Capture. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the BlackIceDevMode.ocx ActiveX control. This component performs insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data passed in the SetAnnotationFont() method which results in stack corruption. This corruption can be leveraged to achieve code execution under the context of the process.\n  ",
