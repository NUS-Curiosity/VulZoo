    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the loadPCMFromByteArray function in the flash.media.Sound object. When this function is called with a high number of 'samples' an integer overflow occurs during the calculation of a buffer size. This can lead to memory corruption that can result in remote code execution under the context of the current user.\n  ",
