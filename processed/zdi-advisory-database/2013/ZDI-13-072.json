    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of Type1 fonts in t2k.dll. A file parsing vulnerability can occur by controlling a value placed after the \"/Subrs\" keyword in the eexec portion of the file which defines a size of an array.   An attacker can leverage this to gain code execution under the context of the current user.\n  ",
