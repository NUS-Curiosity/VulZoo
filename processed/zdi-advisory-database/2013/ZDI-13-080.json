    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the CoreAudioToolbox component processing an mp3 file.  Altering the channel_mode value from stereo to mono in the header of a stereo mpeg frame could result in a heap buffer overflow. An attacker could leverage this to gain remote code execution under the context of the process.\n  ",
