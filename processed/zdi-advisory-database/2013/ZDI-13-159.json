    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the com.sun.org.glassfish.gmbal.ManagedObjectManagerFactor class.  The issue lies in the failure to validate permission to access a method during method call.  This allows access to methods in classes that would otherwise not be reachable.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
