    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific vulnerability is inside the FileImageInputStream class. With the usage of this class, it is possible to disable the security manager and run code as privileged. This allows a malicious applet to execute attacker-supplied code resulting in remote code execution under the context of the current user.\n  ",
