    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM SPSS. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the olch2x32.ocx ActiveX control. This object uses the Load() method to load a 2D chart into the browser. When parsing an OC2 file, the code trusts a value at a certain offset. An attacker can alter this value to control the arithmetic done on this value which can result in a user controlled pointer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the process.\n  ",
