    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ABB MicroSCADA Wserver. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the wserver.exe component which listens on TCP port 12221. This component performs insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data which results in stack corruption. An attacker can leverage this situation to execute code under the context of the user running the application.\n  ",
