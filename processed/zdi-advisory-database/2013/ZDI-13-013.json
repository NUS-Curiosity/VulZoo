    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the JavaFX WCMediaPlayer class. All WCMediaPlayer's private native methods are accessible from descendant classes through corresponding protected methods. A value utilized by these native functions can be controlled by the class constructor and can be set to an arbitrary memory pointer to cause memory corruption. An attacker could leverage this to gain remote code execution under the context of the process.\n  ",
