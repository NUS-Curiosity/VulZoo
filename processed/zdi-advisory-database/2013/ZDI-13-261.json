    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP Virtual User Generator. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of requests to the EmulationAdmin web service. This service exposes the getReport method which does not properly sanitize parameters allowing a remote attacker to inject arbitrary SQL into the underlying database.  This can be leveraged by an attacker to gain remote code execution under the context of the current database.\n  ",
