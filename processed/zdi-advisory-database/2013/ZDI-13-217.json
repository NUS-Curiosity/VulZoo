    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the usage of a CCaret object.  The process can be made to delete an object resulting in a dangling pointer. The process can be later forced to reuse this pointer in the CCaret::UpdateScreenCaret function resulting in a use-after-free condition. An attacker can leverage this situation to execute code under the context of the user running the browser. \n  ",
