    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP LoadRunner. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the lrFileIOService ActiveX control.  The control exposes the CreateFileCont method. The method does not properly sanitize the path for the filename, allowing for directory traversal. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to write files under the context of the current process, which can then be used to execute code under the context of the current user.\n  ",
