    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Endeca Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of requests to the controlSoapBinding web service. This service exposes the attachDataStore method which contains a directory traversal flaw that allows attackers to create files at arbitrary locations with attacker controlled data. This can be leveraged by an attacker gain to remote code execution under the context of the current user.\n  ",
