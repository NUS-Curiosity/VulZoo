    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the construction of VibrateWindowListener objects.  A dangling pointer can be created that will then be sent to the VibrateWindowListener constructor. By abusing this behavior an attacker can ensure this memory is under control and leverage the situation to achieve remote code execution under the context of the user running the browser.\n  ",
