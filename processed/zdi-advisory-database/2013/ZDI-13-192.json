    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the existence of KUSER_SHARED_DATA.  The issue lies in the ability to predict the address of the structure, which can then be used to leak addresses.  An attacker can leverage this to bypass ASLR and DEP on the host.\n  ",
