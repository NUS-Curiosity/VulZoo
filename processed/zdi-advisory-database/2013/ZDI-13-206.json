    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP LoadRunner. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the LrWebIEBrowserMgr.dll ActiveX control.  The control exposes the FlushSnapshotToFile method. The method does not properly sanitize the destination path allowing for directory traversal. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to write files and ultimately execute code under the context of the current user.\n  ",
