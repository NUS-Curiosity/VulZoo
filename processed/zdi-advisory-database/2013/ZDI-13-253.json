    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ABB RobotStudio Tools. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the cw3dgrph.ocx ActiveX control. The ImportStyle method allows an attacker to load a specially crafted .cwx file from a remote network share.  Following this call, the attacker can invoke the ExportStyle method to save the file to an arbitrary location through the use of a directory traversal vulnerability.  A remote attacker can abuse this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user.\n  ",
