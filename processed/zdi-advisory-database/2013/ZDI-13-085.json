    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of TransNavContext objects.  The issue lies in focusing on an element, reloading the page, then manipulating the DOM while focus still resides with the element.  By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
