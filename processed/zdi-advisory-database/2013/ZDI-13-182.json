    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP LoadRunner. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the lrFileIOService ActiveX control.  The control exposes the WriteFileBinary method which accepts a parameter named data that it uses as a valid pointer. By specifying invalid values an attacker can force the application to jump to a controlled location in memory. This can be exploited to execute remote code under the context of the user running the web browser.\n  ",
