    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Mozilla Firefox handles the concatenation of strings. By causing concatenation of specially crafted strings, an integer overflow may occur resulting in an undersized allocation. Subsequent use of this undersized memory allocation results in memory corruption, which may be exploited by an attacker to gain remote code execution. \n  ",
