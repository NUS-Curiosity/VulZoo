    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Apple QuickTime handles textBox elements within a TeXML file. Specifically, the code within QuickTime.qts does not properly validate the coordinate values of the x and y attributes. By providing specially crafted coordinate values, the code can be made to write data ahead of a buffer, leading to memory corruption. This memory corruption could lead to remote code execution under that context of the current process.\n  ",
