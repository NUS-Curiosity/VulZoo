User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the JavaFX D3DRendererDelegate class. A value utilized by the class constructor is passed to a native function and is interpreted as a pointer to an object. An attacker could leverage this to gain remote code execution under the context of the process.\n  ",
