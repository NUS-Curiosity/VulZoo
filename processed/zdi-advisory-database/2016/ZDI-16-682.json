    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ThinPrint. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of print requests. The issue lies in the failure to properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges under the context of the host OS.\n  ",
