    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Data Protector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within OmniInet.exe which listens by default on TCP port 5555. When parsing a malformed user name field in an EXEC_BAR request, the process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length stack buffer. A remote attacker can abuse this to execute remote code under the context of SYSTEM.\n  ",
