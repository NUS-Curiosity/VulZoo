    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Panasonic FPWIN Pro. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of a project file. A specially-crafted project file will lead to type confusion in DeleteAndCreateSysRegDecls_And_SaveSysRegDeclsDatabaseIdsToTheSysRegDeclInfoMap.  This type confusion will cause a jump through a vtable entry that is past the end of the vtable for the object.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to attain code execution under the context of the current process.\n  ",
