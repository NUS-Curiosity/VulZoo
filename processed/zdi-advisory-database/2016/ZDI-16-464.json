    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Joyent SmartOS. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the dtrace implementation in SmartOS. A method within this implementation allows for an arbitrary write to occur from an out of bounds indexing issue which results in code execution. This allows an attacker to elevate privileges to escape a zone and achieve privileged execution on the headnode.\n  ",
