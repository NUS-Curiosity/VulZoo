    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Check Point ZoneAlarm Extreme Security.  An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x8400001f by the vsdatant kernel driver. The issue lies in the failure to validate a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code under the context of kernel.\n  ",
