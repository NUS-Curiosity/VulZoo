The ARRIS VAP2500 product team worked quickly to develop a software update to resolve the reported vulnerabilities and shared the update with our service provider customers in October, 2016. As with many of the products we make, this update ultimately is delivered to the end user's equipment by their respective service provider. The reported vulnerabilities did not compromise video content or end users' personal data, but could have the potential to cause device stability problems in some unlikely circumstances.\"       ",
