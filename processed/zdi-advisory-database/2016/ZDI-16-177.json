    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Edge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the code that renders PDF documents. By supplying a malformed PDF document an attacker can cause Microsoft Edge to use a Infra::CAsyncTpWorker object in memory after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
