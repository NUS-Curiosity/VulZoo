    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Maximum Security.  An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x0022205c by the tmnciesc kernel driver. The issue lies in the failure to properly validate user-supplied data which can result in a memory corruption condition.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of kernel.\n  ",
