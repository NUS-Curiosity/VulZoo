    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose information on vulnerable installations of Joyent SmartOS. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the dtrace implementation in SmartOS. A function within this implementation allows for arbitrary reads from kernel space. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary memory from the headnode where the zone resides.\n  ",
