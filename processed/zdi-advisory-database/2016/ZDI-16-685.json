    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Apple macOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within IOCommandQueue. The process does not properly validate user-supplied data which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges under the context of the kernel.\n  ",
