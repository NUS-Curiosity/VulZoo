    "description": "    This vulnerability allows attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Avira Free Antivirus. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x00220010 by the ssmdrv driver.   The issue lies in failure to properly validate user-supplied data which can result in a memory corruption condition within the kernel.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the kernel.\n  ",
