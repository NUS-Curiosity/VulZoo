User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within parsing of a dvp file.  A malformed dvp file can cause heap corruption and the BorrlndmmSysGetMem function will write to an arbitrary memory location in the user process.
