    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Edge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the JavaScript map method, as defined on typed arrays. By performing certain operations in script, an attacker can cause JavaScript to write outside the bounds of the array. An attacker can leverage this to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
