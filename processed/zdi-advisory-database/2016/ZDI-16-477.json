    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of PCRE. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the compilation of regular expressions.  The issue lies in the failure to validate that compilation of sub-groups will occur within the bounds of a fixed-size stack buffer.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code within the context of the current process.\n  ",
