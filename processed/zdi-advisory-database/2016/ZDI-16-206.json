    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple OS X. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the IOUSBInterfaceUserClient interface.  The issue lies in the failure to ensure that a user-supplied index is within the bounds of the allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this to escalate their privileges and execute code under the context of the kernel.\n  ",
