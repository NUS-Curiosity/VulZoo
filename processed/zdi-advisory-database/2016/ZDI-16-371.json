User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of CBaseScriptable::PrivateQueryInterface. By performing certain operations in script, an attacker can cause Microsoft Edge to read uninitialized data from a memory location on the stack. An attacker can leverage this to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
