    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Apple macOS.  An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within CoreStorage. The issue lies with the failure to validate user-supplied arguments which can cause a null pointer dereference. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code under the context of the kernel.\n  ",
