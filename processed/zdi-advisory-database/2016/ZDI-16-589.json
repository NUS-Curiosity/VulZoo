    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple OS X. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within AppleSMC's smcHandleYPCEvent.  The process does not properly validate the existence of an object prior to performing operations on it.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges under the context of the kernel.\n  ",
