    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of MethodHandles.filterReturnValue. Due to unsafe handling of reflection of privileged classes inside the MethodHandles class, it is possible for untrusted code to gain access to privileged methods and properties. This can result in remote code execution under the context of the current process.\n  ",
