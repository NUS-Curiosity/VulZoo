    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Eclipse Jetty. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way the ContextHandler class restricts access to protected resources. By issuing a crafted request, an attacker can gain access to the code of a web application deployed in Jetty. An attacker can use this knowledge in further attacks against the web application. Additionally, if the web application allows file uploads, it may be possible for an attacker to modify the code of the web application, achieving a direct path to executing arbitrary code under the context of the server process.\n  ",
