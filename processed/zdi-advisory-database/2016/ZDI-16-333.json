User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of a project file. A specially-crafted project file will lead to a write beyond the end of a heap buffer in the createLoadContent method due to an unvalidated length that is input from the project file.
