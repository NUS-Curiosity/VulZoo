    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ARRIS VAP2500. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the various txt_mac parameters provided to the config_wds.php management portal page. The issue lies in the failure to properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of root.\n  ",
    "addtionnal_details": "        \"ARRIS has taken the security vulnerabilities reported by the Zero Day Initiative for the ARRIS VAP2500 product seriously. The ARRIS VAP2500 product team worked quickly to develop a software update to resolve the reported vulnerabilities and shared the update with our service provider customers in October, 2016. As with many of the products we make, this update ultimately is delivered to the end user's equipment by their respective service provider. The reported vulnerabilities did not compromise video content or end users' personal data, but could have the potential to cause device stability problems in some unlikely circumstances.\"       ",
