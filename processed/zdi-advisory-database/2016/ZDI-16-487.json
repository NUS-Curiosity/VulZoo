    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of AVG Internet Security. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of the 0x83002120 IOCTL by the AvgTdix device driver.   The issue lies in the failure to properly validate a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of kernel.  \n  ",
