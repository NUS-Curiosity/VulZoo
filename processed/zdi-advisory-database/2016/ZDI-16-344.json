    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple OS X. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the dtrace facility.  The issue lies with the failure to validate user-supplied chunk size values which can lead to arbitrary read and write of memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code under the context of the kernel.\n  ",
