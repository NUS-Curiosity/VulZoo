    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial condition on vulnerable installations of Oracle GoldenGate. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the GoldenGate mgr process, which listens on TCP port 7809. By default, this process does not require authentication before accepting data delivery and GGSCI commands from a remote machine. This allows for a remote attacker to disable the service or exhaust resources on the target machine.\n  ",
