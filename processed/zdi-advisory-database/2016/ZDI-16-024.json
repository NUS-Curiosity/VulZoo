User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within font parsing. A specially crafted font embedded in a PDF file can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
