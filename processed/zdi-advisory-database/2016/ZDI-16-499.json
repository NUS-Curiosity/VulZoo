    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Joyent SmartOS. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the dtrace implementation in SmartOS. A method within this implementation allows for an arbitrary write to occur which results in code execution. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges to escape a zone and achieve privileged execution on the headnode.\n  ",
