    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Bitdefender Antivirus Plus.   An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x002222f4 by the avc3 kernel driver. The issue lies in the failure to validate a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of kernel.\n  ",
