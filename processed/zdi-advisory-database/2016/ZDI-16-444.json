    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle WebLogic. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe PartItem class in WebLogic FileUpload allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a NULL byte in a file name in a serialized instance,  when used in conjunction with a specific version of Oracle Java.  It also allows the attacker to copy any file into a different location. By copying it to the web application root directory, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
