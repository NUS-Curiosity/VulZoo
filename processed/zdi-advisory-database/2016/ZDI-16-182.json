    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the OleLoadPicture function.  User-supplied data is used to calculate a buffer length for allocation, and if the image is a bitmap, the function can then write beyond the buffer boundary. An attacker can leverage this functionality to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user.\n  ",
