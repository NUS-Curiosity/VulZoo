    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Joyent SmartOS. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the dtrace implementation in SmartOS.  A method within this implementation allows for an integer overflow to occur which results in the \nallocation of a buffer that is too small which is then overflowed.  This allows an attacker to elevate privileges to escape a zone and achieve privileged execution on the global zone.\n  ",
