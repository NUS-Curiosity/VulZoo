    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Edge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw relates to how Edge handles text nodes within HTML documents. By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can cause Microsoft Edge to use a pointer to a CTreePos as if it were a pointer to a Tree::ANode. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
