    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Rockwell Automation RSLogix Micro Starter Lite.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of a RSS (project) file. The issue lies in the failure to properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the process.\n  ",
