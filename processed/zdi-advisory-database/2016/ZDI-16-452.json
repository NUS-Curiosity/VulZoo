    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Edge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability relates to how Microsoft Edge constructs Referer headers in HTTP requests. By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can force a string in memory to be reused after it has been freed. As a result, unintended information will be included in the Referer header. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
