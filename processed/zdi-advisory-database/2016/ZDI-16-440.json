    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Schneider Electric SoMachine HVAC. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the SetDataIntf method of the AxEditGrid control.  The control has an untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability because it blindly calls an attacker-supplied memory address. A remote attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
