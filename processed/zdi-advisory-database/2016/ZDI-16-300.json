User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the fillColor attribute. By setting the fillColor attribute to a specially crafted array an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed.
