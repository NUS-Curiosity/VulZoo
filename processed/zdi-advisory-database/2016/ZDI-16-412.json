    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Edge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability relates to how Microsoft Edge requests permission from the user to allow a website to access device location information (for example, GPS). By performing certain actions in script, an attacker can force a CGeolocationManager object in memory to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
