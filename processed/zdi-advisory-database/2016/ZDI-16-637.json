User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the AppleIntelHD5000Graphics kernel extension. The issue lies in the failure to ensure that a user-supplied pointer is valid prior to dereferencing it.
