    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Ecava IntegraXor. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of save report requests. The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input validation before using remotely supplied strings to construct SQL queries. By sending a specially crafted request to a vulnerable system, an unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the process.\n  ",
