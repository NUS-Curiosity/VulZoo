    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of embedded Javascript code when opening a PDF.  Adobe Acrobat has defined it's own set of Javascript functions that can be used in a PDF file.  Due to improper parameter checking to one of these functions arbitrary memory can be over-written leading to remote code execution.  If successfully exploited remote control of the target system can be gained with the credentials of the logged in user.",
