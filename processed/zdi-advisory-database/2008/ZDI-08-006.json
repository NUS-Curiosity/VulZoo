    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of the \"by\" property of an animateMotion SVG element. By assigning other DOM elements to this property, a memory corruption occurs during the destruction of a Variant data type. The corruption causes an overwrite of a virtual function address allowing for the execution of arbitrary code.",
