    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with vulnerable installations of EMC ApplicationXtender Workflow Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the Admin Agent service (aws_tmxn.exe) which listens by default on TCP port 2606. The process receives network packet data into a static heap buffer. Exploitation allows remote attackers to corrupt heap memory subsequently leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
