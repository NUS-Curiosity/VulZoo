    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sun Java Web Start. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists in the GetVMArgsOption() function used while parsing the java-vm-args attribute of the j2se tag in xml based JNLP files. When a user downloads a malicious JNLP file, the vulnerable attribute is read into a static buffer. If an overly long value is defined by the java-vm-args attribute, a stack based buffer overflow occurs, resulting in an exploitable condition.",
