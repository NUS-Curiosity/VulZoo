    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell eDirectory Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within dhost.exe, the service responsible for directory replication which is bound by default to TCP port 524. Improper parsing within opcode 0x24 via the Netware Core Protocol can result in an arithmetic calculation based on supplied user-input resulting in an under-allocated heap buffer. This fault can be leveraged to result in arbitrary code execution.",
