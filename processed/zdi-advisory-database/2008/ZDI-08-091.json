    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Helix Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists during NTLM negotiation. The function responsible for decoding Base64 will return a length value on success and 0xFFFFFFFF on failure. The variable used for the return value is unsigned and is interpreted as an actual length value later on. This discrepancy leads to a heap overflow while attempting to copy 0xFFFFFFFF bytes worth of data. Exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
