    "description": "This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the functionality exposed by the Storage Foundation for Windows Scheduler Service, VxSchedService.exe, which listens by default on TCP port 4888. The management console allows NULL NTLMSSP authentication thereby enabling a remote attacker to add, modify, or delete snapshots schedules and consequently run arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.
