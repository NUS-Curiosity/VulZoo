    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Cerulean Studios Trillian. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the tooltip processing code for Trillian. When creating a tooltip for an image, the application generates an XML tag including a property containing the filename. This data is then copied directly into a stack-based buffer without any length verifications which can eventually lead to code execution with the privileges of the client.",
