    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Motorola RAZR firmware based cell phones. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must accept a malicious image sent via MMS.\nThe specific flaw exists in the JPEG thumbprint component of the EXIF parser. A corrupt JPEG received via MMS can cause a memory corruption which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.",
    "addtionnal_details": "Together, ZDI and Motorola have identified a potential vulnerability related to viewing malicious, manipulated JPEG files affecting select RAZR-series devices. Although the possibility of this vulnerability occurring is very remote and would only occur in unique circumstances, Motorola proactively corrected it in all new device releases.\n\nTo ensure that you have the latest software load available for your device, please visit:\n\nhttp://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/NSS/update_my_software.asp",
