    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to remotely obtain domain credentials on vulnerable installations of Symantec Altiris Deployment Solution. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the axengine.exe service listening by default on TCP port 402.
