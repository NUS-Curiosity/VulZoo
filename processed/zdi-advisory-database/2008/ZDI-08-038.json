    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of SMIL text embedded in video formats. No sanity checking is performed on values of the qt:next attribute. When the URI for this attribute is a file type not recognized by QuickTime, it is passed to url.dll!FileProtocolHandler which will allow explorer.exe handle non-http filetypes. Successful exploitation can result in the execution of arbitrary code.",
