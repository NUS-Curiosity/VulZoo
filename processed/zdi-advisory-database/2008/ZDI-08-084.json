    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page, open a malicious e-mail, or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when parsing malformed RTF documents. When processing consecutive \"\\do\" Drawing Object tags mso.dll does not properly verify the integrity of the object and frees a memory buffer twice, leading to heap corruption. Successful exploitation can lead to remote compromise of a system under the credentials of the currently logged in user.",
