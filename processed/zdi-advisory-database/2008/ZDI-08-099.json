    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page, or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when parsing Microsoft Excel documents containing a malformed REPT formula embedded inside a cell. During evaluation of this cell Excel miscalculates the size of a static buffer and copies the result of the formula into it resulting in an exploitable condition. This can result in a remote compromise of the system under the credentials of the currently logged in user.",
