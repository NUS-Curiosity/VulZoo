    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sun Java Web Start. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists in the useEncodingDecl() function used while parsing the xml header character encoding attribute. When a user downloads a malicious JNLP file, the charset value is read into a static buffer. If an overly charset name in the xml header is included, a stack based buffer overflow occurs, resulting in an exploitable condition.",
