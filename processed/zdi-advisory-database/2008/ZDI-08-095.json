    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with vulnerable installations of EMC ApplicationXtender Workflow Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the Admin Agent service (aws_tmxn.exe) which listens by default on TCP port 2606. The process exposes functionality to upload arbitrary files to the remote system. The daemon fails to sanitize directory traversal attacks, allowing remote attackers to overwrite critical system files or even the Admin Agent executable itself. Exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
