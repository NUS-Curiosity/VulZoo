    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trillian. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious image file.\nThe specific flaws exists during the parsing of messages with overly long attribute values within the FONT tag. The value for any attribute is copied into a stack based buffer via sprintf() which can result in a buffer overrun and can be subsequently leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the privileges of the logged in user. Exploitation may occur over the AIM network or via direct connections.",
