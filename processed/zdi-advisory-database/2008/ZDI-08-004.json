    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious web address or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists in the parsing of embedded JavaScript code within PDF documents. When the function printSepsWithParams() is called with certain malicious parameter values an integer overflow can occur resulting in a memory corruption. This may be subsequently leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the privileges of the current user. ",
