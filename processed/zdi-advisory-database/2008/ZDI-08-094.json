    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox with Adobe's Flash Player. User interaction is required in that a user must visit a malicious web site. \nThe specific flaw exists due to a failure to check whether the Flash module has been properly dynamically unloaded. If an SWF file dynamically unloads itself via an outside JavaScript function, the browser will return to an address no longer mapped to the Flash module. Exploitation of this vulnerability can result in arbitrary code execution under the context of the currently logged in user.",
