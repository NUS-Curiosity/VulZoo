    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of QEMU. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of file descriptor maps. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
