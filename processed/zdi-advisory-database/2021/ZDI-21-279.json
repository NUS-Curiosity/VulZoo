    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Google Android. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the fts_driver_test_write function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
