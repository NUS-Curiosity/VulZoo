    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the cldflt.sys driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory.
