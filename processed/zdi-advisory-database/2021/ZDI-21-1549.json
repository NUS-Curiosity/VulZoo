    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of X.Org Server. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of SProcScreenSaverSuspend requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer.
