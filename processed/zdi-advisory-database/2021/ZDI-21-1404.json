    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of OpenText Brava! Desktop. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of SLDDRW files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
