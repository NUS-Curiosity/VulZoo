    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Fatek Automation WinProladder. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of PDW files.
