    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Fuji Electric V-Server Lite.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of VPR files.  The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
