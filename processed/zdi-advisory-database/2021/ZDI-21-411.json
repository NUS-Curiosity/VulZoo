    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Google Chromium. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the XOR operation when executed within JIT compiled code. By performing actions in JavaScript, an attacker can trigger a memory access past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
