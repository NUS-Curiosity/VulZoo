    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of VMware ESXi. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of SLP messages. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer.
