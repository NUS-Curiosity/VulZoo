    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Fuji Electric Alpha5. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of A5V files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
