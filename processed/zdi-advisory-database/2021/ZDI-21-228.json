    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Siemens JT2Go. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of PAR files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read before the start of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
