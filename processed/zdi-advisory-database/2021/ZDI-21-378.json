    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Apple macOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of IOCTL 0x10004 in the AppleIntelKBLGraphics kext. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
