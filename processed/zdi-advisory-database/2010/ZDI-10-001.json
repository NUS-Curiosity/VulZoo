    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iManager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists in an application called by the iManager in order to handle importing/exporting of schema information. While importing/exporting from the schema, the sub-application fails to validate the length of its arguments while copying user-supplied data into statically allocated stack buffer. This can result in code execution under the privileges of the application.",
