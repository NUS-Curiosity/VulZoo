    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell Zenworks Desktop Management. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the tftpd server component which listens by default on UDP port 69. When handling the filename in a Read Request (0x01) packet type the process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the tftpd server process.",
