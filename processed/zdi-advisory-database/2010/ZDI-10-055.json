    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to violate security policies on vulnerable installations of Sun Java Runtime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must run a malicious applet.\nThe specific flaw allows malicious applets to connect to network addresses other than the originating applet and client IPs. A handcrafted applet can override compile time checks to prevent compilation of a mutable InetAddress subclass. This results in the ability to circumvent the Applet SecurityManager restictions.",
