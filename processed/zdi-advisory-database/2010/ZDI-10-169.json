    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell Netware. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within SSHD.NLM. When the application attempts to resolve an absolute path on the server, a 512 byte destination buffer is used without bounds checking. By providing a large enough value, an attacker can cause a buffer to be overflowed. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution under the context of the server.",
