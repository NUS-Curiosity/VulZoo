    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with vulnerable installations of the RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists in RealPlayer's pnen3260.dll module while parsing the TIT2 atom within AAC files. The code within this module does not account for a negative size during an allocation and later uses the value as unsigned within a copy loop. Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user opening the AAC file.",
