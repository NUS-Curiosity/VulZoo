    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within the both the Netscape (Firefox) and ActiveX (Internet Explorer) plugin components npnipp.dll and ienipp.ocx which are installed by default with the iPrint client. When handling the printer-state-reasons operation provided via the embed tag the module makes a request to the specified printer-url and performs insufficient validation of the size of the printer-state-reasons status response.  The process then copies this user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser.",
