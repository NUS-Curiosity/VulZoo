    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ovutil.dll module which is loaded by the ovwebsnmpsrv.exe process which in turn can be reached remotely through the jovgraph.exe CGI program. By supplying overly large values to variables passed through an HTTP request a sprintf can be made to overflow a static buffer. An attacker can leverage this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the webserver.",
