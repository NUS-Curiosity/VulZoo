    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the primary QuickTime.qts library when parsing the BkPixPat opcode (0x12) within a PICT file. The application will use 2 fields within the file in a multiply which is then passed as an argument to an allocation. As both operands in the multiply are user-controllable, specific values can cause an under allocation which will later result in a heap overflow. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the current user.",
