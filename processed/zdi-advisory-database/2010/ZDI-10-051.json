    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Sun Java Runtime Environment. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious website.\nThe specific flaw exists within the deserialization of RMIConnectionImpl objects. Due to a lack of privilege checks during deserialization it is possible to supply privileged code in the ClassLoader of a constructor being deserialized. This allows for a remote attacker to call system level Java functions without proper sandboxing. Exploitation of this can lead to remote system compromise under the context of the currently logged in user.",
