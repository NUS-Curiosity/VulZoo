    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Informix Database Server. SQL query execution privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists when processing the arguments to the DBINFO keyword in a SQL query.
