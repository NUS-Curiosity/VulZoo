    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Skype. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists with how the OS web-browser passes command line arguments to Skype through the registered 'skype:' protocol handler. Insufficient sanity checking to the /datapath argument allows an attacker to construct a link that will execute Skype with arbitrary arguments. This can be abused to specify a remote configuration storage directory which can be leveraged to glean target user credentials.",
