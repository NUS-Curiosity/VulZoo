    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP StorageWorks Storage Mirroring. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the DoubleTake.exe component which listens by default on TCP port 6320. When handling an incoming packet the process blindly trusts a user supplied length for a copy of arbitrary data into a fixed-length buffer on the heap. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
