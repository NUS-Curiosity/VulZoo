    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli FastBack Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe which listens by default on TCP port 11460. The issue is due to a strcpy of user supplied data and length to a fixed size buffer located on the stack. Specifically, this issue can be triggered by providing a large enough user_path variable. Successful exploitation leads to remote code execution under the context of the fastback server.",
