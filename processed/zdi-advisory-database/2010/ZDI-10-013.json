    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists when specific elements are used within a table container. If one of these elements is removed the application will unlink the element from the layout tree incorrectly. When this tree is later traversed, the application will reuse the object that has been freed which can lead to code execution under the context of the current user.",
