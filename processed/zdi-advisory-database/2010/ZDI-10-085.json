    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the getnnmdata.exe CGI. If this CGI is requested with an invalid iCount POST parameter a sprintf() call is made to log the error. However, no length check is performed on the variable contents before copying in to a fixed-length stack buffer. This can be leveraged by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the webserver process.",
