    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists during the parsing of a malformed SubImage Header Stream from a malicious FlashPix image. The application takes the NumberOfTiles field from this data structure, multiplies it by 16, and then uses it in an allocation. If this result is larger than 32-bits the value will wrap leading to an under-allocated buffer. Later when the application copies data into this buffer, a buffer overflow will occur leading to code execution within the context of the application.",
