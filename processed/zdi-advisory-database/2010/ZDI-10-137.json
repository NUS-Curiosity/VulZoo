    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ov.dll module which is loaded by the webappmon.exe CGI program. This DLL defines a function execvp_nc which unsafely concatenates a controllable command string into a statically allocated stack buffer. By supplying overly large values to variables passed through an HTTP request \na strcat_new can be made to overflow this buffer. An attacker can leverage this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the webserver.",
