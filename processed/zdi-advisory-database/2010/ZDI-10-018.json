    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute remote code on vulnerable installations of IBM Cognos Server. Proper authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists due to a hidden manager-level account with a default password defined in the user configuration of the bundled Tomcat server. This server can be reached via HTTP on TCP port 19300. A malicious attacker can use this account to manage or deploy a servlet onto the server. By abusing this ability a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the Tomcat server.",
