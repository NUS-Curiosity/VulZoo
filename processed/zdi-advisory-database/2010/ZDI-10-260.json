    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that a user must be coerced into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within Apple's support for Panoramic Images and occurs due to the application trusting a particular field for calculation of an offset. Due to the field being treated as a signed integer, the calculated offset can result in a pointer outside the bounds of the expected buffer. Upon usage of this out-of-bounds pointer, the application will write proceed to write image data to the invalid location. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
