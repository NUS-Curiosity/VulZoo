    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists during the parsing of MPEG content. Upon reading a field used for compression within a 'genl' atom in the movie container, the application will decompress outside the boundary of an allocated buffer. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
