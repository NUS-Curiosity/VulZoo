    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the applications support for parsing the RMX file format. When parsing the format, the application will explicitly trust 32-bits in a field used in the header for the allocation of an array. This can cause a buffer to be under-allocated and will cause a buffer overflow when initializing the array. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
