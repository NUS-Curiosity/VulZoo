    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave. User interaction is required in that a target visit a malicious website.\nThe specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing Director files. The vulnerable function is exported as an ordinal from the iml32.dll module. Ordinal 1409 trusts a value from the file as an offset and updates pointers accordingly. By crafting a large enough value and seeking the file pointer past the end of a buffer this can be abused to corrupt heap memory. An attacker can abuse this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.",
