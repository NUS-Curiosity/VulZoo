    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when parsing an .AAC file containing a malformed MLLT atom. The application utilizes a size specified in this data structure for allocation of a list of objects. To calculate the size for the allocation, the application will multiply this length by 8. If the multiplication results in a value greater than 32 bits an integer overflow will occur. When copying data into this buffer heap corruption will occur which can lead to code execution under the context of the currently logged in user.",
