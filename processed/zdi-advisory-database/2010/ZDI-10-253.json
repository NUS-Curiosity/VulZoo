    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required in that a target must open a malicious media file or visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the application's implementation of the LZW compression when opening a certain file format. The application will allocate a buffer for the image and then decompress image data into it. Due to explicitly trusting the decompressed data, a buffer overflow will occur.  This can lead to memory corruption and code execution under the context of the application.",
