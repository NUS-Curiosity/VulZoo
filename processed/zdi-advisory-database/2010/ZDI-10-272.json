    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious media file.\nThe specific flaw exists in the parsing of audio codec information encapsulated in a Real Audio media file. While processing cook audio codec data the number of subbands is improperly calculated. By specifying a large number of subbands an allocated heap chunk can be overflown. Successful exploitation can result in system compromise under the credentials of the currently logged in user.",
