    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists during the rendering of an audio stream utilizing QDesign's audio codec. The application will perform an allocation utilizing a field specified in the sample's description. Later when initializing the buffer, the application will utilize a different length.
