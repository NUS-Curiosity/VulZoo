    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the browser plugins provided by RealNetworks. The RecordClip method can be access via the ActiveX control or the Firefox plugin. By injecting a specific character into the arguments to this method, invalid parameters can be passed to a child process that is launched on the local system. This parameter injection allows an attacker to download and subsequently execute a file on a target system, thus allowing for remote code execution.",
