    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious document.\nThe specific flaw exists in the parsing of SXVIEW records in an Excel spreadsheet. Due to the lack of checking when parsing structure items for the record it is possible to write arbitrary data to a user controlled address. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution under the credentials of the currently logged in user.",
