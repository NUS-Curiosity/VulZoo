Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application utilizes a bundled component for rendering graphs. The application will pass user-supplied arguments to this component without proper sanitization. An attacker can abuse this to specify arbitrary arguments to this tool.
