    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to break out of the Java Sandbox implemented by Oracle's relational database. Authentication is required in that a user must be able to create a Java stored procedure to trigger the issue.\nThe specific flaw exists within Oracle's custom SecurityManager implementation. Due to the implementation's dependence on a flag of a particular object to determine success or failure of a privileged call, a race condition exists which will allow one to execute Java code bypassing the sandbox. Successful exploitation will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the server.",
