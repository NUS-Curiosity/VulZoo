    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sun's Java Runtime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the CMM module of the Sun JVM. This module contains a function readMabCurveData. An applet can indirectly call this function and provide it with a malicious curv object. The function trusts the size of the curv element implicitly and copies the data into a fixed-length stack buffer. Exploitation of this issue can lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the user invoking the applet.",
