    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the application's support for a component within the SIZ marker in a JPEG 2000 image. When the component contains a malicious value, the application will add a corrupted object to a queue of data which will be processed by the Component Manager's JP2 decompressor. Later when attempting to decompress this data, the application will use the corrupted object. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
