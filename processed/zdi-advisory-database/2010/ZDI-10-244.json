    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists during the parsing of samples from a malformed MOV file utilizing the H.264 codec. While parsing data to render the stream, the application will miscalculate a length that is used to initialize a heap chunk that was allocated in a header. If the length is larger than the size of the chunk allocated, then a memory corruption will occur which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
