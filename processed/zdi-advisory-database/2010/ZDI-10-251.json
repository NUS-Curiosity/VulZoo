User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the application's support for huffman tables within a flashpix file. By specifying an index larger than a particular value, a pointer will cease to get initialized. Later the application will use this pointer to as the destination in a copy operation. Successful exploitation will lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
