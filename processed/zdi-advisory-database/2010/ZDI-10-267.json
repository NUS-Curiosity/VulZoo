    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the application's implementation of the Advanced Audio Coding compression format. When decoding a conditional component of a data block within an AAC frame the application will decompress lossy audio sample data outside the bounds of a buffer. This memory corruption can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
