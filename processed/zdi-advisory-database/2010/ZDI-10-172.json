User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the support for XUL <tree> objects. If a specific property of a tree object is set and the parent node attempts to remove the child, the process can be made to access invalid memory.
