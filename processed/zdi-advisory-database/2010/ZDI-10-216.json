    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Informix Dynamic Server. Authentication is required in that an attacker must have valid credentials to connect to the database.\nThe specific flaw exists within the oninit.exe process bound by default to TCP port 9088 or 1526. A lack of sanity checking within a logging function can result in a stack based buffer overflow leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
