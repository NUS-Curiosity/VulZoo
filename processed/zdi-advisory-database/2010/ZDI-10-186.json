    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial of service condition on vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli FastBack Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe which listens by default on tcp port 11406. The issue is due to an unchecked user supplied length value. This value is used to iterate over supplied data and calculate a CRC value. Successful exploitation leads to an unhandled access violation and immediate termination of the FastBackServer.exe process. ",
