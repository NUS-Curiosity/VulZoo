    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within RealPlayer's parsing of RealPix files. If such a file contains an image tag pointing to a remote server, the player will attempt to fetch the remote file. When parsing the response from the web server, the process blindly copies the contents of the Server header into a fixed length heap buffer. If an attacker provides a large enough string, critical pointers can be overwritten allowing for arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running the player.",
