User interaction is required in that a target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists in the parsing of DBQueryExt records in an Excel spreadsheet. Due to the lack of checking when parsing particular fields within the structure, it is possible to get a user-controlled pointer to be called.
