    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within Firefox's management of the JSSLOT_ARRAY_COUNT annotation. This value represents the number of items filled within a given Array object. If an attacker creates an array to a high enough value, an initialization routine can be made to mis-allocate a buffer. This can be abused by an attacker to corrupt memory and subsequently execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.",
