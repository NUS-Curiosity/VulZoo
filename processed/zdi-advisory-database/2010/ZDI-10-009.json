    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within RealPlayer's parsing of IVR files. The process trusts size values present in the file and uses them unsafely in various file I/O and memory allocation operations. A specially crafted file can cause memory overflows to occur leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the user running the player.",
