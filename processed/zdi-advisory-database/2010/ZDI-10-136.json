    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell Teaming. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the Tomcat server installed by default with Teaming. The server exposes an AJAX request handler which allows a remote user to upload an image via the upload_image_file operation. By crafting a specially formatted filename an attacker can bypass a name-mangling mechanism and traverse outside the intended temporary directory. By uploading a malicious JSP document to the web directory, an attacker can abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
