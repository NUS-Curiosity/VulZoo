    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. \nThe flaw exists within the ienipp.ocx component. When handling the exposed method a GetDriverSettings call is made into nipplib!IppGetDriverSettings2 where the process will blindly copy user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack.
