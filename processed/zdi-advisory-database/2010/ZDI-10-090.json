    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell ZENworks. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Preboot Service (novell-pbserv.exe). This service listens for incoming connections on TCP port 998. The service uses a simple binary protocol where the first DWORD is an opcode followed by the specific opcode's data, typically in length/value pairs. These length values are not checked against the destination buffers size allowing for stack-based overflows to occur. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the SYSTEM user.",
