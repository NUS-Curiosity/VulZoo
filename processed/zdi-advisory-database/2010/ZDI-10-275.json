    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is requires in that a target must navigate to a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the HandleAction method of the RealPlayer ActiveX control with CLSID FDC7A535-4070-4B92-A0EA-D9994BCC0DC5. The vulnerable action that can be invoked via this control is NavigateToURL. If NavigateToURL can be pointed to a controlled file on the user's system, RealPlayer can be made to execute scripts in the Local Zone. To accomplish this, a malicious attacker can force a download of a skin file to a predictable location and then point NavigateToURL at it thus achieving remote code execution under the context of the user running RealPlayer.",
