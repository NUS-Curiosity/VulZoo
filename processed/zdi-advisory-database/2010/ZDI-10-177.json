    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Domino. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the nrouter.exe service while processing a malformed e-mail. The process copies the contents of the MAILTO header within a calendar request into a fixed size stack buffer. By providing enough data this buffer can overflow leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
