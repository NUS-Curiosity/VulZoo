    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the libpr0n library which is responsible for handling image caching and animation and is due to the way the application handles animations received from the server via the multipart/x-mixed-replace mimetype. During a case where the bits-per-pixel changes, the application will free a pointer and then can be made to reuse the freed pointer later. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
