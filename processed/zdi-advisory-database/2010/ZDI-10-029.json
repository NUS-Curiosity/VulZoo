    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple WebKit. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists in the WebCore's HTMLObjectElement::renderFallBackContent() method. By rewriting an HTML element via the document's innerHTML() method a memory corruption occurs resulting from a call-after-free. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user.",
