    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is required in that a user must be coerced into opening up a malicious document or visiting a malicious website.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way the application parses a particular property out of a flashpix file. The application will explicitly trust a field in the property as a length for a loop over an array of data structures. If this field's value is larger than the number of objects, the application will utilize objects outside of this array. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
