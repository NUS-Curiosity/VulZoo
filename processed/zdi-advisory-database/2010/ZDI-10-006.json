    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required in that a user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious web site.\nThe specific flaw exists during the parsing of GIF files with forged chunk sizes. The player uses values from the file improperly when allocating a buffer on the heap. An attacker can abuse this to create and then overflow heap buffers leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the currently logged in user.",
