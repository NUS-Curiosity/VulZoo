    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM DB2. Authentication is required in that a user must have the ability to connect to the database.\nThe specific flaw exists within the install_jar procedure. The install_jar procedure contains a directory traversal vulnerability that will allow the attacker to upload a Jar file to a directory outside of the intended \"\\function\\jar\\Name_of_logged_user\\\" directory. A remote attacker can abuse this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user.",
