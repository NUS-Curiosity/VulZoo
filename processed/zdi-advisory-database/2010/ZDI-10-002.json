    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Secure Backup. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the Oracle Secure Backup Services daemon observiced.exe listening on TCP port 10000 by default. Due to the lack of bounds checking on the reverse lookup of connections to the port a stack-based buffer overflow can occur leading to a complete compromise of the affected system under the credentials of the SYSTEM account.",
