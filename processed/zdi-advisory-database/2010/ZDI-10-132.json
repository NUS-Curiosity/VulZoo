    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the browser's method for parsing child elements out of a particular tag. The application will use a 32-bit index to enumerate them, but will store it in a 16-bit signed integer and then use it to allocate space for a cache.  When populating the cache a buffer overflow will occur. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
