    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trent Micro Control Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the mrf.exe component composes a string used to display an error message. The application will build the string using a buffer located on the stack using a sprintf call. As attacker controlled data is used to construct the string, this can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
