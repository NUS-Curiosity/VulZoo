    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the iccvid.dll module responsible for compression and decompression of VIDC (Cinepak) streams. The code within CVDecompress allocates a static amount of space for storing an RGB palette. By modifying a VIDC compressed stream within an AVI file, an attacker can force code within iccvid to loop excessively, each time incrementing the pointer for the palette storage. By abusing this behavior an attacker can execute arbitrary code under the context of the user invoking the application that uses this codec.",
