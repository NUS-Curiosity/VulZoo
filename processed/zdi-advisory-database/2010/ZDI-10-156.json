    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Notes Email Client. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious email attachment.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Lotus Notes file viewer utilizing the KeyView SDK to render a malformed Word document. The application will copy an arbitrarily sized ASCII string representing the font name into a constant sized buffer located on the stack. If large enough this will lead to a buffer overflow and can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
