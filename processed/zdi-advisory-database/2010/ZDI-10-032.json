    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of SAP MaxDB. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the serv.exe process which listens by default on TCP port 7210. The process trusts a value from a handshake packet and uses it as a length when copying data to the stack.
