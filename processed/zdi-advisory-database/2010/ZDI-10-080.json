    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP Mercury LoadRunner. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the process magentproc.exe that binds to TCP port 54345. A specially crafted packet will allow unauthenticated users to execute local commands. When a state of 0 or 4 is passed after the parameters, mchan.dll will process the commands on the host. This allows for remote code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
