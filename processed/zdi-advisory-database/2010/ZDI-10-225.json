Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the rdPageImlogic.aspx page which is exposed through an IIS extension on the default web server port. By setting the 'rdReport' argument to the value 'DetailReportGroup' an attacker can force the server to load the DetailReportGroup.lgx definition file.
