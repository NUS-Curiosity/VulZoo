    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within the quicktime.qtx. When handling the m1s atom an integer value is used as an offset into a buffer. Minimal validation is done and an attacker can supply a negative value. This can be used to write to an arbitrary address in process memory. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user.",
