    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Cisco WebEx Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists during the parsing of strings defined within the ARF file format. Strings are typically prefixed by their valid length. By supplying a string much longer than the defined length a heap overflow will occur which can be further leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user.",
    "addtionnal_details": "This issue has been resolved in T27FR14, deployed to WebEx customers in April.",
