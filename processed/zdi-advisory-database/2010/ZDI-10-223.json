    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec IM Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the rdpageimlogic.aspx and rdPage.aspx pages which is exposed through an IIS extension on the default web server port. By setting the 'rdReport' argument to the value 'LoggedInUsers' an attacker can force the server to load the LoggedInUSers.lgx definition file. This file contains multiple SQL injections within the following parameters: 'loginTimeStamp', 'dbo', 'dateDiffParam' and 'whereClause'. An attacker can abuse this to inject arbitrary SQL statements to be evaluated by the back-end database.",
