    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sun's Java Runtime Environment. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within a function responsible for allocating objects in the com.sun.media.sound libraries. This function takes an integer parameter and adds a fixed amount to it before allocating from the heap. This can be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution by forcing a call to this allocator with a large enough integer parameter.",
