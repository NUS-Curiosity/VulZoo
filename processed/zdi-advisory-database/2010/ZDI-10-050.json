User interaction is required in that the victim must visit a malicious website or be coerced into opening a malicious document.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application handles particular events for an nsTreeSelection element. Upon execution of a \"select\" event the application will access an element without checking to see if it's been previously freed or not.
