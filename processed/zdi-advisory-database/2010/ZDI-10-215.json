    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Informix Dynamic Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the RPC protocol parsing library, librpc.dll, utilized by the ISM Portmapper service (portmap.exe) bound by default to TCP port 36890. A lack of sanity checking on supplied parameter sizes can result in an integer overflow and subsequent heap buffer under allocation which can finally lead to an exploitable memory corruption.",
