    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to deny services on vulnerable installations of Novell eDirectory. Authentication is not required in order to trigger this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within Novell's eDirectory Server's NCP implementation which binds, by default, to TCP port 524. While handling a malformed request, the application explicitly trusts a field when translating it to an index into a table of counters. If this index is too large, the application will set a value outside the array and the ndsd process will become unresponsive resulting in an inability to authenticate to that server.",
