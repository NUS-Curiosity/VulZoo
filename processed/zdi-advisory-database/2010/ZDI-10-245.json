User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the application trusting a value defined within a file. This value will have some arithmetic performed on it, and subsequently be used as a counter for a processing loop. By modifying this value, an attacker can reliably corrupt memory. Successful exploitation will lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
