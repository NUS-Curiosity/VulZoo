    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Tivoli Storage Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe which listens by default on TCP port 1320. When handling a packet with header type 0xFAFBFCFD the process blindly copies user supplied data into a heap buffer.
