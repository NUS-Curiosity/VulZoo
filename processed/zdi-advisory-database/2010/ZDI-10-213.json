    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the RealPlayer ActiveX control. This module is responsible for handling the tfile, pnmm, cdda, protocol handlers. While parsing a long argument ending with \".smil\" an attacker can overflow a buffer on the heap.
