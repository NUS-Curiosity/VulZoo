Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of variables to the property_box.php script located on the Oracle Secure Backup administration server. Due to the lack of filtering on special characters it is possible to specify arbitrary commands to the command line being executed by the administration server.
