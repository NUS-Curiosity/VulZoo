    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple Safari's Webkit. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within Webkit's layout implementation of an particular tag used for embedding a foreign document into the SVG namespace. Later when the application attempts to calculate layout information for rendering the contents of the tag, the application will attempt to access a linebox that was previously destroyed. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
