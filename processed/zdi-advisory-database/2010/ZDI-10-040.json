    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists during the parsing of samples from a malformed .mov file utilizing the RLE codec. While decoding RLE data, the application will fail to validate the size when decompressing the data into a heap chunk. If the length is larger than the size of the chunk allocated, then a memory corruption will occur which can lead to code execution under the context of the currently logged in user.",
