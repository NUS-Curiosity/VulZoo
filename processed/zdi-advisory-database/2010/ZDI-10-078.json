    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell ZENworks. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ZENworks Server (zenserver.exe). This Tomcat server listens by default on TCP ports 80 and 443. The vulnerability exists in the UploadServlet. Using the UploadServlet an attacker can upload a malicious file outside of the TEMP directory on the server. By accessing this uploaded file remotely it is executed in the context of the zenserver.exe process. This can be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running the ZENworks server.",
