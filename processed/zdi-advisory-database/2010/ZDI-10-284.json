    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell ZENWorks. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the ZenRem32.exe process which listens by default on TCP and UDP ports 1761. When processing the Console DN field of incoming requests, the process can be made to overflow a stack buffer by 2 bytes. Due to the location of the destination buffer, an attacker can abuse this to overwrite a portion of a return address and execute remote code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
