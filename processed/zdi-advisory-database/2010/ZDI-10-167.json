    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the module responsible for handling the FLV file format. While parsing the HX_FLV_META_AMF_TYPE_MIXEDARRAY and the HX_FLV_META_AMF_TYPE_ARRAY data types the ParseKnownType function makes two improper calculations that can force integers to wrap. A remote attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user playing the file.",
