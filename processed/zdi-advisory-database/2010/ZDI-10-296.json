    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within the nipplib.dll component which is used by both the Mozilla and IE browser plugins for iPrint Client. When handling an IPP response from a user provided printer-url the process does not properly validate the size of the destination buffer and copies user supplied data of an arbitrary length into a fixed length buffer on the heap. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser.",
