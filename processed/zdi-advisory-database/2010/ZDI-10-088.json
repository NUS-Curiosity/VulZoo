    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Shockwave. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing 3D objects defined inside Director files. These files are essentially RIFF-based, but stored in big endian format. An undocumented 4-byte field within record type 0xFFFFFF49 can be modified to cause corruption of heap memory. This corruption can be used to modify function pointers and achieve remote code execution under the context of the user running the browser.",
