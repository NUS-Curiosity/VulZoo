    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to deny services on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Exchange Server 2007. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within store.exe during the handling of a particular MAPI call. The service will enter a loop whose termination is controlled by an attacker. If the attacker specifies an invalid value, the loop will never terminate causing the service to stop responding to requests. This results in a denial of service against the target server.",
