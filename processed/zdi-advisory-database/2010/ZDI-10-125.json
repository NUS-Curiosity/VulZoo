    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM solidDB. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the solid.exe process which listens by default on TCP port 1315. The code responsible for parsing the first handshake packet does not properly validate the length of the username field. By crafting an overly long value in the request an attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.  ",
