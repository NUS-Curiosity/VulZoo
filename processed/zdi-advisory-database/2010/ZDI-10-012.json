    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that an attacker must coerce a victim to visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists due to the application rendering intertwined strike and center tags containing an element that manipulates the font baseline such as 'sub' or 'sup'. When this element pointer is removed the application will later dereference it even though it has been freed. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the currently logged in user.",
