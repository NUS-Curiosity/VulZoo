    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Quicktime.qts module responsible for parsing media files. While handling 3GP streams a function within this module a loop trusts a value directly from the media file and uses it during memory copy operations. By supplying a large enough value this buffer can be overflowed leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the user accessing the file.",
