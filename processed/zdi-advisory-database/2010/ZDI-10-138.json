    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the '/opt/novell/iprint/bin/ipsmd' component this component communicates with 'ilprsrvd' which listens on TCP port 515.
