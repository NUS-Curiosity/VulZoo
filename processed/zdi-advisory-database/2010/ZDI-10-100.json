    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple's Webkit. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application duplicates event listeners in .svg documents. Upon creating an AnimateTransform object, the library will create a timer to handle the transformation and duplicate the object's event listener into Webkit's \"shadow tree\" of the image. Upon destruction of the shadow tree and the original tree, the application will destroy the Element containing the event listener twice. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
