    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary SQL into the backend database on vulnerable installations of Symantec IM Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the IM Manager interface exposed by the web server which listens by default on TCP port 80. The rdpageimlogic.aspx file does not validate the rdReport variable when parsing requests. It parses SQL statements from the file pointed to by this variable. A remote attacker can abuse this behavior to inject arbitrary SQL into the backend database.",
