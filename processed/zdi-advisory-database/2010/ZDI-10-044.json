User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within QuickTimeAuthoring.qtx during the parsing of DELTA_FLI chunks stored within a malformed .fli file. The applications trusts a user-supplied length for decompression which can be modified to copy more data than necessary leading to a buffer overflow. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution under the context of the current user.",
