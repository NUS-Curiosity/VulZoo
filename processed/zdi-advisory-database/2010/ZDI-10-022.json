    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of both IBM Informix Dynamic Server. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaws exist within the RPC protocol parsing library, librpc.dll, utilized by the ISM Portmapper service (portmap.exe) bound by default to TCP port 36890. During authentication, a lack of proper sanity checking on supplied parameter sizes can result in exploitable stack and heap based buffer overflows leading to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
