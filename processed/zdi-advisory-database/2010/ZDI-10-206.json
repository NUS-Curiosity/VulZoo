    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Oracle Java Runtime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the JP2IEXP.dll responsible for handling the Java plugin within Internet Explorer. When an applet is embedded within a page, the code within this module parses out the docbase parameter and copies it into a fixed-length buffer located on the stack. An attacker can overflow this buffer and execute remote code under the context of the user running the browser.",
