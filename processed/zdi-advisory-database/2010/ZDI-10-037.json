    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists during the parsing of compressed mjpeg data from a malformed .mov file. The application will utilize the width and height fields in the file for calculating the size of a heap buffer. When copying into this buffer, the application will use a different field in the file to determine when to stop copying. If the first calculated length is smaller than the one used for decompression, a memory corruption will occur which can result in code execution under the context of the current user.",
