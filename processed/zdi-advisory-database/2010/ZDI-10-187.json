    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial of service condition on vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli FastBack Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within FastBackServer.exe process which listens by default on TCP port 11406. The problematic code resides within a function responsible for reading a block of network packet data. A parameter to this function is initialized to 0 and under certain conditions this value will be accessed before properly initialized. This causes a NULL pointer to be dereferenced and subsequent application crash due to a lack of exception handling. Successful exploitation leads to immediate termination of the fastback server.",
