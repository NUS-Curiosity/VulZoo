    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when parsing a RealMedia .IVR file containing a malformed data header. The application explicitly trusts an index in this data structure to seek into a list of objects. If one specifies an index outside the bounds of the array, the application will later dereference an object from the calculated pointer and then call it, leading to code execution under the context of the current user.",
