    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to escape the sandbox on affected installations of Apple Safari. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the securityd service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code under the context of the current user.",
