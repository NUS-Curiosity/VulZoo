    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of LAquis SCADA.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of LQS files.  The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read before the start of an allocated data structure.  An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.",
