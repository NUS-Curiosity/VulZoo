    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Apple MacOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the fillUBMSurfaceInfoInternal function in AMDRadeonX4000.kext. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
