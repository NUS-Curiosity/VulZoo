    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Docker. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within docker-credential-secretservice. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing further free operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the application.",
