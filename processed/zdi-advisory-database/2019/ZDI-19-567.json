    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Panasonic Control FPWin Pro. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of PRO files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer.
