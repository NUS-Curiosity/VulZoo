    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious web page.\nThere is an issue with the way the product handles URIs within certain schemes. The product does not warn the user that a dangerous navigation is about to take place. Because special characters in the URI are not sanitized, this could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands.
