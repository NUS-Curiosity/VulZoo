    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of DirectComposition PropertySet objects in the kernel. The issue results from a failure to guard critical data from being modified while the kernel is performing an operation, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
