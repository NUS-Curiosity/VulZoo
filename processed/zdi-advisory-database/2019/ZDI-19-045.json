    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Oracle VirtualBox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the crUnpackExtendGetAttribLocation method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
