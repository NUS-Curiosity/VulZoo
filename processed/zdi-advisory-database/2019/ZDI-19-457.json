    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Intelligent Management Center. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling AMF3 requests to the amf endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM.",
    "addtionnal_details": "This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 120 day deadline.\n\n01/09/19 - ZDI sent the vulnerability report to the vendor01/09/19 - The vendor replied with tracking number01/30/19 - The vendor PSIRT mentioned they were working with the engineering team to get an updated schedule02/27/19 - ZDI asked the vendor again for any ETA for updates for this product02/27/19 - The vendor replied they would follow up04/24/19 - ZDI notified the vendor that the reports will be published as 0-day on 05/09 if these are not patched before\n\n-- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting.",
