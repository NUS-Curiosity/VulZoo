    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the hidparse.sys driver, within function HidPParseCollections call. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges in the context of the kernel.",
