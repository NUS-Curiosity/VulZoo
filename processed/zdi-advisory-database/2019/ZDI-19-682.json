    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Apple macOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the RsrcAndXorByteFlag method of the AMDRadeonX4000_AMDAccelSharedUserClient class. TThe issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to the level of the kernel.",
