    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Wecon LeviStudioU. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of HSC files. When parsing the LaIndexID and TextContent attributes, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of Administrator.\n  ",
