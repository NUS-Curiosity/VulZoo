    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers in close proximity to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Google Android. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must accept a malicious file transfer.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of Bluetooth packet lengths. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
