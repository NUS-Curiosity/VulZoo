    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Schneider Electric IIoT Monitor. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the addEvent method of the EventMgmt servlet. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a specially crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to bypass authentication on the system.",
