    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Electronic Arts Origin. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious web page.\nThere is an issue with the way the product handles URIs within certain schemes. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user at medium integrity.",
