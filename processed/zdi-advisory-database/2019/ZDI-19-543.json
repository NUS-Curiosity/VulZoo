    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Apple MacOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of sideband tokens in the AMDRadeonX4000_AMDSIGLContext class.
