    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of virtualized e1000 devices. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
