    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the e1000 driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
