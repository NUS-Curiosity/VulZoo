    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of virtualized e1000 devices. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the host OS.",
