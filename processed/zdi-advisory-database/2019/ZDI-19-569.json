    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Apple macOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the AMDRadeonX4000_AMDAccelResource method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before reading from memory.
