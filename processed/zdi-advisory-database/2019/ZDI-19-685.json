    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Apple macOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the diskmanagementd daemon. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
