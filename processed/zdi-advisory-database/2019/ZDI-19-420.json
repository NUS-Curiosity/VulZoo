    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of data sent to UHCI endpoints.
