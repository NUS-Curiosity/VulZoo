    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro ServerProtect. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the SpntSvc.exe daemon, bound by default on TCP port 5168 and exposing the following DCE/RPC interface through TmRpcSrv.dll:\n    /* opcode: 0x00, address: 0x65741030 */\n    error_status_t sub_65741030 (\n        [in] handle_t arg_1,\n        [in] long arg_2,\n        [in][size_is(arg_4)] byte arg_3[],\n        [in] long arg_4,\n        [out][size_is(arg_6)] byte arg_5[],\n        [in] long arg_6\n    );\nA sub-function within this interface is vulnerable to a stack overflow due an unbounded call to wcscpy() within the routine CAgRpcClient::CreateBinding() defined in AgRpcCln.dll library.",
