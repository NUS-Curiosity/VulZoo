    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with vulnerable installations of the RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists in RealPlayer's parsing of SWF files. The SWF rendering DLL RealPlayer uses fails to properly handle malformed record headers leading to an exploitable overflow. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using an ActiveX control {CFCDAA03-8BE4-11cf-B84B-0020AFBBCCFA} and embedding the malicious swf file in the page or by convincing an affected user to directly open a SWF file using RealPlayer.
