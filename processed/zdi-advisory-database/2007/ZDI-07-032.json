    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Samba. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the parsing of RPC requests to the SRVSVC RPC interface. When parsing a request to NetSetFileSecurity, heap allocation is calculated based on user input. By specifying invalid values, heap blocks can be overwritten leading to remote code execution.",
