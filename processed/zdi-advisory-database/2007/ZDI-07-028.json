    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Computer Associates AntiVirus Server. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the authentication function of the inoweb service that listens by default on TCP port 12168. The function copies both the username and password into fixed-length stack buffers. If an attacker provides overly long values for these parameters, an exploitable buffer overflow occurs.",
