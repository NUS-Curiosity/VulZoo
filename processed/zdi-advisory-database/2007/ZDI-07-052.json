    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of MIT Kerberos. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the svcauth_gss_validate() function. By sending a large authentication context over RPC, a stack based buffer overflow occurs, resulting in a situation allowing for remote code execution.\nThe vulnerable line of the function is:\n    memcpy((caddr_t)buf, oa->oa_base, oa->oa_length);\nIf 128 < oa->oa_length < 400, the exploitable situation occurs. Over 400 bytes is caught during a separate check for MAX_AUTH_SIZE earlier in the RPC packet decoding process. ",
