    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Ipswitch IMail and ICS server. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists due to a lack of bounds checking during the\nparsing of arguments to the SUBSCRIBE IMAP command sent to the IMAP daemon listening by default on TCP port 143. By providing an overly long string as the argument, an exploitable stack-based buffer overflow occurs. ",
