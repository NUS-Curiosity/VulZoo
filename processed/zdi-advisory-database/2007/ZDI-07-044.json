    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with affected installations of BakBone NetVault Reporter. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists both within the scheduler client (clsscheduler.exe) listening on TCP port 7978 and the scheduler server (srvscheduler.exe) listening on TCP port 7977. In both cases an exploitable heap corruption can occur during the processing of overly long filename arguments to the \"GET\" and \"POST\" requests. Code execution is possible under the context of the SYSTEM user.\nWhen searching for a termination/whitespace character (\"\\r\\t\\n\") a heap chunk is being used to hold the data. Due to the lack of bounds checking on this heap chunk an overflow occurs when a long string without any of the above special characters are encountered. The vulnerable code appears below.\n    0x00466C07 mov     al, [esi+ebp]\n    0x00466C0A cmp     al, 20h\n    0x00466C0C jz      short loc_466C84\n    0x00466C0E cmp     al, 9\n    0x00466C10 jz      short loc_466C84\n    0x00466C12 cmp     al, 0Ah\n    0x00466C14 jz      short loc_466C84\n    0x00466C16 cmp     al, 0Dh\n    0x00466C18 jz      short loc_466C84\n    0x00466C1A push    1\n    0x00466C1C inc     esi\n    0x00466C1D push    1\n    0x00466C1F lea     edx, [esi+ebp]   ; heap chunk\n    0x00466C22 push    edx              ; readfds\n    0x00466C23 mov     ecx, edi\n    0x00466C25 call    sub_4645C0       ; recv 1 byte\n    0x00466C2A cmp     eax, 0FFFFFFFFh\n    0x00466C2D mov     [ebx+272Ch], eax\n    0x00466C33 jnz     short loc_466C07 ;loop",
