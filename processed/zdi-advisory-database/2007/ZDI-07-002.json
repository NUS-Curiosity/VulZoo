    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Backup. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of RPC requests to the Tape Engine service which listens by default on TCP port 6502 with the following UUID:\n    62b93df0-8b02-11ce-876c-00805f842837\nThe handler function for RPC opnum 0xBF directly calls user-supplied data in the RPC request, resulting in trivial arbitrary code execution.",
