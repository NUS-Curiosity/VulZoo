    "description": "Several vulnerabilities exist in the popular Verity KeyView SDK used in many enterprise applications like IBM Lotus Notes. When parsing several different file formats a standard stack overflow occurs allowing a malicious user to gain complete control of the affected machine under the rights of the currently logged in user. The problem lies when copying user supplied data to a stack based buffer without any boundary conditions.\nThe following file formats have been identified as vulnerable:\nAdobe Acrobat FrameMaker - .mif\nApplix Words - .aw\nMicrosoft Rich Text Format - .rtf\nPortable Executable - .exe\nDynamic Link Library - .dll\nApplix Presents - .ag\nMicrosoft Word - .doc ",
