    "description": "These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard (HP) OpenView Network Node Manager (NNM). Authentication is not required to exploit these vulnerabilities.\nThe specific flaws exists within the CGI applications that handle the management of the NNM server. Due to lack of bounds checking during a call to sprintf(), sending overly long arguments to the various CGI variables result in a classic stack overflow leading to compromise of the remote server. Exploitation leads to code execution running under the credentials of the web server. Further techniques can be leveraged to gain full SYSTEM access.\nThe following is a list of vulnerable CGI applications:\n- ovlogin.exe\n- OpenView5.exe\n- snmpviewer.exe\n- webappmon.exe",
