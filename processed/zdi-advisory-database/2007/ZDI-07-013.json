    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with affected installations of the Kaspersky Anti-Virus Engine. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the engine's handling of the ARJ archive format. The Kaspersky engine copies data from scanned archives into an unchecked heap-based buffer. This results in heap corruption when a malformed ARJ archive is processed by an application that utilizes the engine. This corruption can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.",
