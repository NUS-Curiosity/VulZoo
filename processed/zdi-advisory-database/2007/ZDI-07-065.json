    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists in the parsing of the CTAB atom. While reading the CTAB RGB values, an invalid color table size can cause QuickTime to write past the end of the heap chunk. This memory corruption can lead to the execution of arbitrary code. ",
