    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows Media Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists during the parsing of malformed skin files (WMZ). A size compressed / decompressed size mismatch can result in an under allocated heap buffer which can be leveraged by an attacker to eventually execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user.
