    "description": "These vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell NetMail. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaws exist in the AntiVirus agent which listens on a random high TCP port. The avirus.exe service protocol reads a user-supplied ASCII integer value as an argument to a memory allocation routine. The specified size is added to without any integer overflow checks and can therefore result in an under allocation. A subsequent memory copy operation can then corrupt the heap and eventually result in arbitrary code execution. ",
