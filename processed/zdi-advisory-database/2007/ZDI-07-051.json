Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the routine TMregChange() exported by TMReg.dll which is reachable through the custom protocol subcode \"\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\". The TCP socket bound to port 5005 receives user-supplied data which is copied without proper bounds checking to a stack-based buffer. Thereby resulting in an exploitable condition. ",
