    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sun Microsystems Java Virtual Machine (JVM). User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious website.\nThe specific flaw exists during the parsing of GIF image components. When the image width in an image block of a valid GIF file is set to 0, the Java runtime will allocate the specified size but subsequently copy all data to the under allocated memory chunk. The overflow results in the corruption of multiple pointers, at least one of which is later dereferenced and can therefore result in execution of arbitrary code.",
