    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows with the Message Queuing Service enabled. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the RPC interface defined on port 2103 with UUID fdb3a030-065f-11d1-bb9b-00a024ea5525. During the processing of opnum 0x06 the service copies user-supplied information into a fixed length stack buffer. Sending at least 300 bytes will trigger a stack based buffer overflow due to a vulnerable wcscat() call. Exploitation of this issue can result in arbitrary code execution. ",
