    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Computer Associates BrightStor ARCserve Media Server. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the SUN RPC service which binds to a randomly chosen high TCP port. The target port can be obtained by querying the port mapper. Multiple stack-based buffer overflows exist during the parsing of malformed RPC strings. Exploitation of these overflows can result in arbitrary code execution.",
