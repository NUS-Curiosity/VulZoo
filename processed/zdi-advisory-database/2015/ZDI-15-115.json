User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability relates to how BitTorrent Sync handles URLs with the btsync protocol. By navigating the user to a specially formed link starting with btsync:, an attacker can inject arbitrary command line parameters that will be passed to BTSync.exe.
