    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability relates to how Internet Explorer handles certain properties of DOM objects. By performing certain actions in script an attacker can cause a property to have an invalid value. When Internet Explorer attempts to read back the property's value, Internet Explorer uses an uninitialized value in memory as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
