    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Schneider Electric ProClima. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the MetaDraw ActiveX control's ObjectOverlappedBy method. The control dereferences an attacker-supplied memory address and redirects execution flow to the resulting address. An attacker can exploit this condition to achieve code execution under the context of the browser process.\n  ",
