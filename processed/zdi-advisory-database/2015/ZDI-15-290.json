    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of SQLite. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the printf function.  The issue lies in the ability to use an arbitrary format string as an argument to an insecure printf function.
