    "description": "    This vulnerability allows domain users to reset arbitrary account passwords on vulnerable installations of Lepide Active Directory Self Service.  No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of the password reset functionality of Active Directory Self Service.  A user should only be able to change the password of other users who have explicitly delegated that power to him.  By crafting request packets to the Lepide web service, a domain user can change the password of any user in the Active Directory domain.  A malicious user can use this to appropriate the account of a Domain Administrator.\n  ",
