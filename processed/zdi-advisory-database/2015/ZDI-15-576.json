    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Unitronics UniDownloader and Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of the PostDataB and FirewallDataB properties of the IPWorksSSL.HTTPS.1 ActiveX control.  Both properties take a value from the script and treat it as the address of a SafeArray and then process information from the SafeArray structure.  An attacker can leverage this type confusion to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
