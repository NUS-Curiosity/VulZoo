    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Domino. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within LDAP handling functionality which listens by default on TCP port 389.  The vulnerable code blindly copies attacker supplied data from a specially formatted LDAP ModifyRequest packet to a fixed length stack buffer.  This can be leveraged by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
