    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to gain information about the layout of memory on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the XSLT function generate-id. The unique ID string it returns can be used to infer the address at which an XML Node object is stored in memory. An attacker can use this information in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the process.\n  ",
