User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of embedded charts. By providing a malformed .docx file with an invalid \"ptCount\" node, an attacker can force uninitialized memory to be read.  This allows for the execution of arbitrary code in the context of the current process.\n  ",
