User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of the item1.xml file inside of the .docx package. By transposing elements, an attacker is able to cause a pointer to be re-used after it was freed. An attacker could leverage this to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user.\n  ",
