    "description": "    This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple OS X. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within IOKit IOHIDSecurePromptClient.  This does not check the length of an attacker-supplied string to the __InsertBytes method before copying it into a fixed length buffer on the heap. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.\n  ",
