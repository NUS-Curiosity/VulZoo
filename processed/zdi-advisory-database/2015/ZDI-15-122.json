User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within XNU HFS_GETPATH. This does not check the length of an attacker-supplied string before copying it into a fixed length buffer. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.\n  ",
