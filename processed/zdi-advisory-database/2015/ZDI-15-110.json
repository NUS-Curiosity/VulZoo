    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of documents loaded through the resource: URL. As the same flag was used for chrome: and resource: URLs, these pages were able to subsequently load privileged chrome pages. By combining this with a same-origin policy bypass, an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\n  ",
