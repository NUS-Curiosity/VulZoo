    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Endeca Tools and Frameworks.  Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, but authentication is easily bypassed.\nThis product installs a web application called Oracle Endeca Workbench, which includes a handler for requests to Script.action. This handler fails to properly authenticate the user, so that an attacker can access this handler using the built-in and undocumented \"anonymous\" user account. This handler allows an attacker to specify arbitrary code that will execute on the Endeca Tools and Frameworks installation, under the context of the \"endeca\" user.\n  ",
