User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the conversion of TIFF files into PDF format. By providing a malformed TIFF, an attacker can cause Foxit Reader to read a VTable from an invalid location.
