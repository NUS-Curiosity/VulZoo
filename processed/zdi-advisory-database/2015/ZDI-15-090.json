    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Schneider Electric DS-NVs. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Rvctl.RVControl.1 ActiveX Control in rvctl.dll. The control does not check the length of an attacker-supplied string in the SetText method before copying it into a fixed length buffer on the stack. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser process.\n  ",
