User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of a dfont file.  When processing a malformed dfont file, a specified value is parsed from the file and passed to the memmove API call which can cause memory corruption.
