    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Google Chrome. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of communication between the GPU process and the renderer processes.  The issue lies in the verification of values from the renderer without copying them out of a shared memory section.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
