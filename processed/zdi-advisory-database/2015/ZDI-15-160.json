    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to transmit unencrypted traffic on the Amazon App Store. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nAll the HTML content within the Amazon App Store is transmitted over HTTPS and URIMatchers. The URIMatchers do not limit traffic to only HTTPS; Therefore, it is possible to request traffic over HTTP. An attacker can chain this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities to install malicious applications.\n  ",
