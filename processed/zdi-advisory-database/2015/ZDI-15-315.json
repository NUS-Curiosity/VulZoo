    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to delete files on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of junction points in AdobeARM.exe. A local attacker running code as a normal user can set up a junction point in the ARM folder and then run a user control which will delete the contents of the folder. An attacker could use this to create a denial-of-service condition under the context of the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
