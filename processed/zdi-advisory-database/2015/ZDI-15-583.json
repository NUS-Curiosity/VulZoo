    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Edge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability relates to how Microsoft Edge deletes elements from attribute arrays (as implemented by CAttrArray). By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can cause Edge to read memory outside the bounds of the array. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
