    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to copy images from vulnerable installations of Samsung SBeam. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must be within range of a hostile NFC transmitter.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the SBeam peer-to-peer wireless connection. As soon as the connection is initiated with NFC, a vulnerable device will launch an HTTP server on port 15000. This server allows a remote attacker to download any or all images on the vulnerable device without notification or user interaction.\n  ",
