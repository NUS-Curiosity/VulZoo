    "description": "    This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple OS X. An attacker must have shell access to exploit this vulnerability, however Guest access is sufficient.\nThe specific flaw exists within the authentication of users who use their iCloud account and password to log in to OS X. Any user is able to change the password of these users without knowing the previous password. This allows an attacker to run arbitrary commands as that user. If the target user is an Admin, the attacker can run arbitrary commands as root.\n  ",
