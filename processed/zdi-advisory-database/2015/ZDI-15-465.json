    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to delete arbitrary files on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of junction points. An attacker running code in the context of a sandboxed Adobe Reader process can set up a junction point in the Synchronizer folder and then run Adobe Collaboration Sync which will delete the contents of the folder. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete files as a normal user from a sandboxed process.\n  ",
