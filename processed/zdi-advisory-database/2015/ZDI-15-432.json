    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Moxa SoftCMS. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Open and Open2 methods in the RTSPVIDEO ActiveX control.  The implementation copies a user-supplied string into a fixed-length heap buffer without validating its size, which can lead to a buffer overflow.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
