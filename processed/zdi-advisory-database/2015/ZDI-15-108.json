    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass the same-origin policy on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of SVG format content navigation. By using a DOMAttrModified mutation event listener, an attacker can inject an arbitrary URL into the history, and cause Firefox to break the same-origin isolation policy.\n  ",
