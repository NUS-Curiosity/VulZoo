    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Moxa SoftCMS.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Open3 method of the RTSPVIDEO.rtspvideoCtrl.1 control.  The implementation copies the user-supplied string to a field in a heap-based buffer without validating the size of the string, which can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
