    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Schneider Electric ProClima. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the DefinedName method.  Memory corruption occurs when a long user-supplied name is supplied.  Later in processing, the code jumps to an address outside of normal flow.  An attacker may be able to leverage this flaw to execute code under the context of the process.\n  ",
