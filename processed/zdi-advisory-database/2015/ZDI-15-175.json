    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of EMC AutoStart. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, but can be easily bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within ftAgent.exe which listens on TCP port 8045, when handling numerous opcodes. The vulnerability is caused by lack of input validation before using a remotely supplied string to construct SQL queries.
