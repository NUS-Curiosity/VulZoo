    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Excel. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of the fileVersion element in the workbook. By providing an overly long value, an attacker can force an object to be used after it has been freed. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
