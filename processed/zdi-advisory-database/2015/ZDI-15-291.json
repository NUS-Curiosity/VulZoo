    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of SQLite. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of DEFAULT expressions for column values.  The issue lies in the ability to create a table that will execute privileged functions by specifying a DEFAULT value for a column and then inserting into the table.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute restricted SQL statements under the context of the current process.\n  ",
