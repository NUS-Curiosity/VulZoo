User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of svg images. A specially crafted svg image can cause Internet Explorer to reuse a CImgTaskSvgDoc object in memory after it has been freed.
