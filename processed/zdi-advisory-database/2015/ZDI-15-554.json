    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose information on vulnerable installations of IBM System Networking Switch Center. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaws exist within the IBM SNSC Web Service, which listens by default on ports 40080 (HTTP) or 40443 (HTTPS) for requests to the administration panel. The first is a race condition, which allows the for the temporary use of a fixed privileged account which is forbidden from interactive login, and the second is the ability to specify any file on the system in ZipDownload.jsp. By combining these two vulnerabilities, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the system.\n  ",
