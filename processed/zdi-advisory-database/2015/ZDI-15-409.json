    "addtionnal_details": "        This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI vulnerability disclosure policy on lack of vendor response.\n\n07/09/2015 - ZDI emailed ASUS requested contact07/28/2015 - ZDI emailed ASUS requested contact08/13/2015 - ZDI emailed ASUS requested contact08/21/2015 - ZDI emailed ASUS requested contact\n\n-- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting.\n\n      ",
