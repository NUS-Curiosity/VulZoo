    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Domino. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within the nldap.exe component which listens by default on TCP port 636. When handling Client Master Key Message packets, the process blindly copies attacker supplied data into an undersized buffer.
