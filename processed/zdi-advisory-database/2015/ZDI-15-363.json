    "addtionnal_details": "        This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 120 day deadline.\n\n05/28/2015 - ZDI sent the report to HP SSRT (believing the product was licensed to or by HP).06/15/2015 - HP SSRT replied to ZDI that ZDI should contact Persistent Systems about any reports concerning the product.06/15/2015 - ZDI asked HP SSRT for a contact.06/15/2015 - HP SSRT advised ZDI that they had tried their known contacts and failed.06/25/2015 - ZDI wrote to Persistent requesting contact, but there was no reply.07/09/2015 - ZDI wrote to Persistent requesting contact, but there is no reply to date.\n\n-- Mitigation:\n\nGiven the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.\n\n-- Vendor Mitigation:\n\nGuidelines to secure the remote notify feature:https://support.accelerite.com/hc/en-us/articles/203659814-Accelerite-releases-solutions-and-best-practices-to-enhance-the-security-for-RBAC-and-Remote-Notify-features\n\n      ",
