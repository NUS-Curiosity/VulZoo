    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Persistent Systems Client Automation. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of certain requests (including getUsers, addAssigneesToRole, and removeAssigneesFromRole). Incomplete authentication allows for crafted packets to enumerate the users on the system and change the roles of users on the system without valid credentials. By using this, an attacker with access to any valid account on the system is able to execute arbitrary code on all clients controlled by the system.\n  ",
