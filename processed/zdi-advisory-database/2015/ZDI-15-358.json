    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of BitTorrent and uTorrent. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability relates to how BitTorrent and uTorrent handle URLs with the bittorrent or magnet protocol. By navigating the user to a specially formed link starting with bittorrent: or magnet:, an attacker can inject arbitrary command line parameters that will be passed to the BitTorrent or uTorrent executable. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current user.\n  ",
