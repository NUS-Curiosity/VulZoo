User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability relates to how Internet Explorer processes SVG marker objects. By setting a particular CSS property and manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can force a Tree::ElementNode object in memory to be reused after it has been freed.
