    "addtionnal_details": "        This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI vulnerability disclosure policy on lack of vendor response.\n\n11/19/2014 - ZDI disclosed report to Visual Mining Technical Support Team.03/13/2015 - ZDI requested a status update.04/22/2015 - ZDI requested a status update.05/18/2015 - ZDI requested a status update.ZDI has recieved no replies from the vendor to our requests for updates.\n\n-- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.\n\n      ",
