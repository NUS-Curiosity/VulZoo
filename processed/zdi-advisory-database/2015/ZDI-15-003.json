    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Schneider Electric ProClima. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ATX45.ATX45Ctrl.1 ActiveX control in Atx45.ocx. The control does not check the length of an attacker-supplied string in the SetHtmlFileName method before copying it into a fixed length buffer on the heap. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser process.\n  ",
