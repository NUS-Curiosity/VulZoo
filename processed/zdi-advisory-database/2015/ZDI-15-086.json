    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must  visit a malicious web page or open a malicious directory or device.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of LNK files by the Windows shell. By providing a pair of crafted files, an attacker is able to force the Explorer process to load an arbitrary DLL when displaying file icons in the directory view. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Explorer process.\n  ",
