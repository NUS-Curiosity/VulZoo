    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers the ability to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable instances of Oracle Endeca Information Discovery.  Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability but an authentication bypass is known.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of the CopyFile endpoint.  The issue lies in the failure to properly sanitize the path of files.  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read server configuration files. This exfiltrated information can then be used to access the system with the privileges of the clover server.\n  ",
