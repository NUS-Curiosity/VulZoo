    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable instances of Oracle Endeca Information Discovery. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability but an authentication bypass is known.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of file downloads. The issue lies in the failure to sanitize the path of files to be downloaded.  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read server configuration files.
