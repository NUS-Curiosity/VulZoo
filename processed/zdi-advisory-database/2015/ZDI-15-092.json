    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Google Android. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Bluetooth application stack allowing for arbitrary Host Controller Interface commands to be issued without prior pairing.  By obtaining a Bluetooth address, creating and emulating a Bluetooth out-of-band 'handover' NFC NDEF tag, and sniffing encryption keys and exchanging them with the device, an attacker can force pairing with a Bluetooth device.  A remote attacker can use this to achieve remote code execution under the context of the process.\n  ",
