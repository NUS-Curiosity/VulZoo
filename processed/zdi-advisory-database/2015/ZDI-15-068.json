    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of WebGate eDVR Manager. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the WESPMonitor.WESPMonitorCtrl.1 control. The LoadImageEx method copies arbitrary data to a fixed-size stack buffer. This would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser.\n  ",
