User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability lies in Internet Explorer's key frame creation and its handling of CSS values. An array containing pointers to CSS values can be manipulated with certain CSS  directives forcing MSHTML!BuildAnimation to read beyond the bounds of the array.
