    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Moxa SoftCMS.   User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the AudioRecord method in the RTSPVIDEO ActiveX control.  The implementation copies the user-supplied string for the ip parameter to a fixed-size stack buffer without validating its size, which can lead to a stack buffer overflow.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
