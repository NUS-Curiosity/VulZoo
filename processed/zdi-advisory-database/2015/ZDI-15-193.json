    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Lotus Domino. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within the nrouter.exe component which handles e-mails dispatched from nsmtp.exe listening on port 25. By specifying malicious dimensions within a BMP, an integer overflow can occur potentially resulting in an undersized buffer being allocated. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
