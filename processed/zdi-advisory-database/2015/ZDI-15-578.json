    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Unitronics VisiLogic OPLC IDE. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the TeeChart object in TeeChart5.ocx. The RemoveSeries method of the object takes a user-supplied integer as an index into an array of object pointers.  The index is not checked for validity and this can cause arbitrary memory to be interpreted as an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user.\n  ",
