Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.\n\n-- Vendor Response:\n\nThe hot fix for the vulnerability is available to all SolarWinds Storage Manager customers. After applying this fix, the authentication bypass issue should no longer occur. For more information, contact Technical Support at www.solarwinds.net/support.\n\nThe patch is available at http://downloads.solarwinds.com/solarwinds/Release/HotFix/STM-v6.1.0-HotFix1.zip\n\n      ",
