    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Persistent Systems Client Automation. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within the radexecd.exe component which listens by default on TCP port 3465. When handling a remote execution request the process does not properly authenticate the user issuing the request. The command to be executed is also not properly sanitized.
