    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of registry links.  An attacker running code in a low-integrity Internet Explorer process can set a registry link that will be followed by the medium-integrity broker process, which will then reduce the security of the target registry key in such a way that it can be modified by low-integrity Internet Explorer processes.  These registry keys can be used to execute medium-integrity processes from low-integrity Internet Explorer processes.\n  ",
