    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Wazuh. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Analysis Engine service, which listens on TCP port 1514 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer.
