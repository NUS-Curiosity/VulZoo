    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of DirectComposition in the win32kbase driver. Crafted parameters to a system call can trigger a dereference of a null pointer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system.",
