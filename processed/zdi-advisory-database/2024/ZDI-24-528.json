    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the hgfsVMCI_fileread function. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it.\nAn attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor.",
