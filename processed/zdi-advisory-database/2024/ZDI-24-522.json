    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Phoenix Contact CHARX SEC-3100 devices. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the filename parameter to the update2-install endpoint. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the user-app account.",
