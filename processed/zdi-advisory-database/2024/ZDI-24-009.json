    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of X.Org Server. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of ProcRRChangeOutputProperty requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before validating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root.",
