    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DCS-8300LHV2 IP cameras. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the ONVIF API, which listens on TCP port 80. When parsing the sch:TZ XML element, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.",
