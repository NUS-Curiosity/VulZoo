    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Western Digital MyCloud PR4100. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of HTTP responses provided to the ddns-start program. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, heap-based buffer.
