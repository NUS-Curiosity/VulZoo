    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft Edge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Microsoft Edge prompts the user after a file is downloaded. A crafted file name can cause the true file extension to be hidden, misleading the user into believing that the file type is harmless. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user.",
