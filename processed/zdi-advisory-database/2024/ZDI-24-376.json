    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information or create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Ivanti Avalanche. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the WLInfoRailService, which listens on TCP port 7725 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before reading from memory. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM or to create a denial-of-service condition on the system.",
