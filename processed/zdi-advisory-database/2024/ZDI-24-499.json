    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TP-Link Omada ER605 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. However, devices are only vulnerable if configured to use a PPTP VPN with LDAP authentication.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the username parameter provided to the /usr/bin/pppd endpoint.
