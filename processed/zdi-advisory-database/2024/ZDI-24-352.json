    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Softing edgeConnector Siemens. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. In the case of a network-adjacent attacker, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the web console, which listens on TCP port 8099 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root within the application container.",
