    "description": "This vulnerability allows physically present attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Linux Kernel. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of USB descriptors. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
