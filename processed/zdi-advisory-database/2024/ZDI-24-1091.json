    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of DirectComposition in the win32kbase driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read before the start of an array. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a denial-of-service condition on the system.",
