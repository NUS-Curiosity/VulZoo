    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of VMWare Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the VBluetoothHCI_PacketOut method.
