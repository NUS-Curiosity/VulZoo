    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of QEMU. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the virtual LSI53C895A SCSI Host Bus Adapter. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor.",
