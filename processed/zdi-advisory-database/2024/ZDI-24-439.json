    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect a malicious Bluetooth device.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of AVDTP packets. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the kernel.",
