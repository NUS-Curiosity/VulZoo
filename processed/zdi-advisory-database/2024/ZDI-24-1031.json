    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NI VeriStand. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of NIVSPRJ files. When parsing the BinaryElements element, the process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user.",
