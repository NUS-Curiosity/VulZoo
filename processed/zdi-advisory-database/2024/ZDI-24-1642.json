    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of the Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of packet filtering. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
