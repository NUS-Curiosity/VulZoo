    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems that have some versions of the GraceNote CDDBControl ActiveX object installed. There is a buffer overflow in an ActiveXObject registered by several products that use the Gracenote CDDB for CD information lookup. The ActiveX Object is commonly registered as safe and can be accessed from a malicious web site.\nThe specific flaw exists when a large string is supplied as an option for the instantiated control. An attacker can gain control of the process leading to arbitrary code execution.",
