    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected versions of Novell NetMail. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the NetMail IMAP service, imapd.exe. The service does not sufficiently validate user-input length values when literals are appended to IMAP verbs to specify a command continuation request. The memory allocated to store the additional data may be insufficient, leading to an exploitable heap-based buffer overflow.",
