    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Symantec VERITAS NetBackup installations. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThis specific flaw exists within the volume manager daemon (vmd.exe) due to incorrect bounds checking during a call to sscanf() that copies user-supplied data to a stack-based buffer. The vulnerable daemon listens on TCP port 13701.",
