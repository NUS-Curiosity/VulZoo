    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Mozilla/Firefox web browser and Thunderbird e-mail client. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious e-mail.\nThe specific flaw is due to incorrect handling of the CSS \"letter-spacing\" element. By specifying a large number, an attacker can overflow an integer used during memory allocation. The under-allocated buffer is later used to store user-supplied data leading to an exploitable heap overflow.",
