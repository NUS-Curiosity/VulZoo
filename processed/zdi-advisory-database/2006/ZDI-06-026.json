    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\n                                                                                   \nThe specific flaw exists due to improper garbage collection when multiple \"imports\" are used on a \"styleSheets\" collection. Crafting a long chain of CSS imports in an HTML document results in a memory corruption eventually leading to code execution.",
