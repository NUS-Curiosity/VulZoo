    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Novell NetMail. Successful exploitation requires the attacker to successfully authenticate to the affected service.\nThe specific flaw exists in NetMail's implementation of the Network Messaging Application Protocol (NMAP). The NMAP server lacks bounds checking on parameters supplied to the STOR command, which can lead to an exploitable buffer overflow. The vulnerable daemon, nmapd.exe, binds to TCP port 689.",
