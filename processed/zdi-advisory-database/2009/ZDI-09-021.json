    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when the application parses a malformed .PICT image. While decoding a tag 0x77 in the image, the application misuses a 16-bit length when allocating tag data. When copying tag data into this buffer, a heap overflow occurs. This can lead to code execution under the context of the current user.",
