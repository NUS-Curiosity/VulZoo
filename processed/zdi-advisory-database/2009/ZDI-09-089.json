    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows Media Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Intel Indeo41 codec which is accessed by various applications through the Video Compression Manager. This codec is registered to handle IV41 streams within a container such as the AVI format. Due to the lack of bounds checking on a specified size within the 'movi' record a heap overflow can occur. If successfully exploited this vulnerability can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user accessing the file.",
