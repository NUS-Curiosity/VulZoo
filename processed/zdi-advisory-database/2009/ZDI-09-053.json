    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the WINS.exe process which provides name resolution services for NetBIOS networks. While parsing a push request the WINS service copies packet data to a static heap buffer while within a controlled loop. By providing a specially crafted request an attacker can overflow this heap buffer leading to arbitrary code execution under the SYSTEM context. ",
