    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Word. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page, open a malicious e-mail, or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of vulnerable tags inside a Microsoft Word document. Microsoft Word trusts a length field read from the file which is used to read file contents into a buffer allocated on the stack. When an invalid length is present, a stack based buffer overflow occurs, resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary code.",
