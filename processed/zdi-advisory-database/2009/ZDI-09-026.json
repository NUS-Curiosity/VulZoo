    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when the application parses a malformed .PSD image. While decoding the columns, rows and channels in the image header, the application trusts a different length for copying than used for allocating it. This results in a heap overflow and can lead to code execution under the context of the current user.",
