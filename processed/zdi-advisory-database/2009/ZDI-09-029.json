    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists during the parsing of malformed Jpen2000 image files. A field is read directly from the file and used to allocate memory for a structure. If the value read is smaller then the expected structure size then a memory corruption will occur which can be leveraged by an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user.",
