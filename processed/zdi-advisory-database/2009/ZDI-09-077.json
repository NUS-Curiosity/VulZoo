    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sun Java WebStart. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists in the implementation of security model permissions during the removal of installer extensions. By modifying an existing installer extension JNLP file, a condition occurs that allows for code supplied by a different URL than the original installer extension URL to run as a secure applet. This condition can result in arbitrary command injection under the privileges of the currently logged in user.",
