    "description": "his vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple Java HotSpot. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists in the undocumented apple.laf.CColourUIResource(long, int, int ,int, int) constructor. When passing a long integer value as the first argument, the value is interpreted as pointer to an Objective-C object. By constructing a special memory structure and passing the pointer to the first argument an attacker may execute arbitrary code.",
