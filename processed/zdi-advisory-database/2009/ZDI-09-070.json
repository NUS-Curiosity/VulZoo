    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the copy constructor for a specific DOM object. When duplicated, more than one reference can be made of anything assigned to it's properties. When the variable/object goes out of scope, these properties will be deallocated twice.
