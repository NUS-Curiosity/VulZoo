    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to trigger a denial of service condition on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows; remote code execution is also theoretically possible. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the processing of SMB requests. By specifying malformed values during an NT Trans2 request an attacker can cause the target system to kernel panic thereby requiring a reboot of the system. Further manipulation can theoretically result in remote unauthenticated code execution.",
