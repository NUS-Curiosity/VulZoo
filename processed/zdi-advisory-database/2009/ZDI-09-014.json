    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader. User interaction is required in that a user must visit a malicious web site or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when processing malicious JavaScript contained in a PDF document. When supplying a specially crafted argument to the getIcon() method of a Collab object, proper bounds checking is not performed resulting in a stack overflow. If successfully exploited full control of the affected machine running under the credentials of the currently logged in user can be achieved.",
