    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard's Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaws exist within Perl CGI executables distributed with Network Node Manager (NNM). Several of these applications fail to sanitize the hostname HTTP variable when requests are made to the NNM HTTP server which listens by default on TCP port 3443. By supplying a pipe operator a malicious attacker can insert arbitrary commands that will be executed on the remote server. ",
