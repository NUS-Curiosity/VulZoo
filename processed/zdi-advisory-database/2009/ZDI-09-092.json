    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious web page or open a malicious SWF file.\nThe specific flaw exists in the parsing of JPEG dimensions contained within an SWF file. Due to the lack of sanity checking when calculating the frame size of an image it is possible to overflow a heap based buffer. Successful exploitation of this issue can lead to remote system compromise under the credentials of the currently logged in user.",
