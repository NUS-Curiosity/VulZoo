    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when the application decodes a .MOV file containing a frame encoded with Quicktime's FIRE codec. While decoding the frame's contents, the application will trust the frame data contains a special terminator during copying of file data to a heap buffer. If the terminator is not found, the application will copy indefinitely. This can result in a heap overflow which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user.",
