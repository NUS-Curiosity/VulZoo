    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to deny services on vulnerable installations of Novell eDirectory. Authentication is not required in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within Novell's eDirectory Server's LDAP implementation. Novell eDirectory's NDSD process binds to port 389/TCP for handling LDAP requests. When the service processes a search request with an undefined BaseDN, it will become unresponsive resulting in an inability to query or authenticate to that server.",
