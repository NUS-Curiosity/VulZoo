    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems running vulnerable versions of Novell's Privileged User Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the unifid.exe service which binds on port 29010 for a protocol providing RPC-like functionality encapsulated over SSL. This protocol allows a client to make a method call into a module. The 'spf' RPC call is implemented unsafely allowing remote attackers to load arbitrary modules over the network resulting in code execution under the context of the service.",
