    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM DB2. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the parsing of VARCHAR arguments to a number of stored procedures available by default on DB2 installations. The vulnerable functions accept VARCHAR(255) strings which are subsequently copied to 218 byte fixed size stack buffers without proper bounds checking resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow. Exploitation can result in system compromise under the credentials of the DB process user.",
