    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the nnmRptConfig.exe CGI executable accessible via the IIS web server listening by default on TCP port 80. While parsing POST variables, the vulnerable process copies the contents of the Template parameter into a fixed length stack buffer using a vsprintf() call. By supplying a large enough value this buffer can be overflown leading to arbitrary code execution. ",
