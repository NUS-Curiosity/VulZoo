    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on systems with vulnerable installations of EMC Documentum eRoom, OpenText Hummingbird and OpenText Search Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists in the Hummingbird STR service (STRsvc.exe) which listens by default on TCP port 10500. The STRlib.dll module receives network packet data into a static stack buffer. By providing a large enough packet, this buffer can overflow. Exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
