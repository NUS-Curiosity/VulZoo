    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious web address or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when parsing malformed U3D model files contained in a PDF. When a specially crafted extension block of a model is processed, insufficient bounds checking is done before a call to wcsncpy(). Because of this a stack overflow can occur resulting in reliable code execution. Proper exploitation of this vulnerability will result in system compromise under the credentials of the currently logged in user.",
