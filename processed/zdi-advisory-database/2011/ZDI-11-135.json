    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Webkit. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way the Webkit library handles WBR tags on a webpage. By adding children to a WBR tag and then consequently removing the tag through, for example, a 'removeChild' call it is possible to create a dangling pointer that can result in remote code execution under the context of the current user.",
