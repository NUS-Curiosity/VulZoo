    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Cisco Secure Desktop. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within CSDWebInstaller.ocx. The CSDWebInstallerCtrl ActiveX control allows downloading and executing any Cisco-signed executable files. By renaming a Cisco-signed executable file to inst.exe and putting it on a webserver, an attacker can subsequently exploit vulnerabilities in the Cisco-signed executable file remotely.",
