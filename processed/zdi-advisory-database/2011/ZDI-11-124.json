    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office PowerPoint. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application parses a record associated with animation. If a container holds a specific record type, the application will explicitly trust a length used in this record to calculate a pointer for copying floating point numbers to. This can be used to write outside of an allocated buffer and will lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
