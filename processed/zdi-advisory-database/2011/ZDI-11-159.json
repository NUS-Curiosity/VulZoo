    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within Firefox's handling of observer OBJECTs. If an observer OBJECT is removed from the mObserverList during an iteration of LOOP_OVER_OBSERVERS macro, one can heap spray over |mObserverList.mNext| and\nchange the execution flow. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.",
