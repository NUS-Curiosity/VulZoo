    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Beehive. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within 'voice-servlet/prompt-qa/Index.jspf'. During the creation of a file used for storing an evaluation parameter user supplied data is used to create a filename and another user specified field is later used to populate that file's contents. By inserting a null byte (0x00) into the filename the user can control the extension of the newly created file. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the oracle user.",
