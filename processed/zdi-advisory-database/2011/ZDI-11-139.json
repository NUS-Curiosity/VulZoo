    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple Safari Webkit. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the library's implementation of a frame element. When parsing a malformed document embedded inside an SVG document, the library will create an anonymous block around a frame element in the block's contents. When freeing this anonymous block via an assignment to the read-only .textContent attribute, a reference to one of the child elements will still exist. Accessing this child element can then lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
