    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP 3COM/H3C Intelligent Management Center. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the img.exe component which listens by default on TCP port 8800. When handling the a packet type the process uses a user provided length value in an arithmetic operation resulting in integer wrapping. The process then copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the heap. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
