    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way that the application allocates space for parsing sample data encoded with the RV20 codec. After allocation, the application will partially fill the allocation with sample data. Upon usage of this sample data, the application will use the uninitialized data to calculate an index that is then written into. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.\n  ",
