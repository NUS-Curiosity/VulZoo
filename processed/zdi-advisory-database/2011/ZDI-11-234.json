    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Control Manager. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Cas_LogDirectInsert.aspx http handler, which listens by default on TCP port 443. A specially crafted POST request allows remote attackers to supply XML and schema information which is used within queries to the backend database. By supplying malicious values, an attacker can inject themselves a user account which can be used to execute code via the management console on the service.",
