    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Enterasys Netsight. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the nssyslogd.exe component which listens by default on UDP port 514. When parsing a new syslog message the process attempts to copy the PRIO field to an intermediate variable. The process does not properly validate the size of the destination buffer and  blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
