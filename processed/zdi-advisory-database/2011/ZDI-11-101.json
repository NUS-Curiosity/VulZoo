    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple's iPhone Webkit library. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way the library implements the .sort function for an array. The library will trust the implementation of a particular method which when executed can be used to manipulate elements out from underneath it. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
