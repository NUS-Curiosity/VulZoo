    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office PowerPoint. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ppcore.dll module responsible for parsing PowerPoint (ppt) files. When parsing a malformed TimeCommandBehaviorContainer structure the process raises an exception that causes an object in memory to be freed prior to being fully parsed. Due to the lack of a check that this object has been freed, a later function references an invalid pointer element. This can be leveraged by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running PowerPoint.",
