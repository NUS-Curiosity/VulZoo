    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP OpenView Data Protector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThis specific flaw exists in the Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe). The Backup Client Service listens on TCP port 5555 for communications between systems in the cell. The process has insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data in a fixed-length buffer on the stack. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed EXEC_BAR message packets to the target, which could ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
