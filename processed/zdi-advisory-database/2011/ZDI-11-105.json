    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP Client Automation. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the radexecd.exe component which listens by default on TCP port 3465. When handling a remote execute request the process does not properly authenticate the user issuing the request. Utilities are stored in the 'secure' path which enable an attacker to re-execute an arbitrary executable. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
