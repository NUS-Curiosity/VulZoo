    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the OnChannelRedirect method. When an OBJECT element has no mChannel assigned, it is possible to call the  |OnChannelRedirect| method, setting a nearly arbitrary object as the channel in use. |mChannel| will become a dangling pointer, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.",
