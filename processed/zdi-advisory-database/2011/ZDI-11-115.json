    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM solidDB. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the solid.exe process which listens by default on TCP ports 1315, 1964 and 2315. The authentication protocol allows a remote attacker to specify the length of a password hash. By specifying a minimum length the attacker can force the process to validate only the first several bytes of the password hash. This can be abused to bypass authentication to the database.",
