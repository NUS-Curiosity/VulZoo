    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Internet Explorer handles calls to the method swapNode(). When a call to swapNode is issued on an node within a document that has two body nodes, Internet Explorer frees an attribute field for one of the body nodes and then later re-uses the freed field during the node swap. This behavior could result in remote code execution under the context of the current user.\n  ",
