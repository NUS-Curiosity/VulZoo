    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java Runtime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Java handles color profiles. When parsing a color profile containing a 'scrn' tag, the process reads a user specified value describing the number of scrn objects in the file. This value is multiplied with the size of an scrn object possibly resulting in an integer overflow. This value is then used to allocate memory to hold all the scrn objects. By providing specific values it is possible to cause a memory corruption that can lead to remote code being executed under to user running the browser.",
