    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the ovutil.dll component which is loaded by the webserver listening by default on TCP port 80. When handling the COOKIE variable passed through a GET request, the process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack.
