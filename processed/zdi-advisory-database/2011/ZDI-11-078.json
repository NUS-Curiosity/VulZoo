    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of 3D assets within a director movie. The routine responsible for parsing 3D record type 0xFFFFFF88 does not properly validate multiple fields within the structure. If these values are too large, the process can create a faulty allocation. Later, when the rendering routine attempts to use this buffer memory is corrupted. This can be abused by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.",
