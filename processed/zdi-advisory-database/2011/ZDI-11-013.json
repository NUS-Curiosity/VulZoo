    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec Web Gateway. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the management interface which listens by default on TCP port 443. While parsing requests sent to the login.php page, the process does not properly sanitize the USERNAME POST parameter.
