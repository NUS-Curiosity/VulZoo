    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Oracle Java Runtime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw is due to insufficient defenses against system clipboard hijacking. When in focus, a handle to the system clipboard can be retrieved without user interaction by a malicious component. The clipboard can then be arbitrarily read from or written to. By writing a TransferableProxy object to the system clipboard and then forcing a paste action, arbitrary code can be executed under the context of the user invoking the JRE.",
