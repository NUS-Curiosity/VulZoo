    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the code responsible for parsing SVG polygon objects. The code within nsSVGPointList::AppendElement() does not account for user defined getter methods modifying or destroying the parent object during a repaint. An attacker can abuse this flaw to create a dangling pointer which is referenced during the traversal of the SVG container hierarchy. This can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser.",
