    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Java handles color profiles. When parsing a color profile containing a invalid 'pseq' tag, the process can be forced to overflow an integer value during an arithmetic operation. The newly calculated value is then used to allocate memory on the heap. By providing specific values it is possible to cause a memory corruption that can lead to remote code being executed under to user running the browser.",
