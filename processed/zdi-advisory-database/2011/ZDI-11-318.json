    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell Zenworks Software Packaging. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the function LaunchProcess exposed via the LaunchHelp.dll ActiveX Control (ProgID LaunchHelp.HelpLauncher.1). The first argument to LaunchProcess is a path to a command to execute, but the argument is not sanitized and is subject to directory traversal. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system.\n  ",
