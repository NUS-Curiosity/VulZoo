    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple QuickTime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application parses a specially formatted RIFF WAV file. When parsing a fmt chunk within the file, the application will use a 32-bit field  to calculate the size of a buffer to allocate. Before the allocation, the application will add 0x14 bytes to the result. Due to restrictions imposed on the implementation of this component by the language and it's platform, an integer overflow can be made to occur. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
