    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application processes the audio specific data within a RealMedia audio file. When decoding sample data, the application will explicitly trust a length read from the sample data when populating a buffer that is allocated based on the codec information. Due to this, a memory corruption can be made to occur which can result in code execution within the context of the application.\n  ",
