    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Java handles color profiles. When parsing a color profile containing a invalid MultiLanguage 'mluc' tag it is possible to cause an integer to wrap during an arithmetic operation. This new value is used to allocate memory on the heap. A remote attacker can abuse the faulty code to execute code under the context of the user running the browser.",
