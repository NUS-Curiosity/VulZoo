    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within the Bitmap parsing component of 2d.dll. When allocating a destination buffer for handling RLE_8 compressed bitmaps the process uses the bitmap height and width values directly. Certain assumptions are made regarding minimum values of these fields during decompression resulting in a copy user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the heap. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user.",
