    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within jsound!XGetSamplePtrFromSnd. When extracting a sample from a soundbank stream user supplied data is used to calculate the bounds of a call to PV_Swap16BitSamples. By supplying a specially crafted sound file, a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.",
