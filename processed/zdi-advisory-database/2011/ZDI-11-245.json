    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Sybase Backup and Monitor servers handle certain data in the login packets. Malformed packets can cause the service in question to lookup a function pointer outside a predefined function pointer array. It is possible to set this function pointer to an address where user controlled data exists and this will result in code execution under the rights of the user running the Monitor Server.",
