    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP H3C/3Com iNode Management Center. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the iNOdeMngChecker.exe component which listens by default on TCP port 9090.
