    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP 3com/H3C Intelligent Management Center. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within the imcsyslogdm.exe component which listens by default on UDP port 514. When handling a syslog packet having a size larger than 2048 bytes the process attempts to exit. An exception handler is called that makes a call into a location that has been previously freed.
