    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists because Java does not sufficiently verify parameters certain functions. The function MixerSequencer.nAddControllerEventCallback fails to check for negative index numbers before writing user supplied data into a static array. This allows a malicious applet to write user controlled data outside the array boundaries resulting in remote code execution under the context of the current user.\n  ",
