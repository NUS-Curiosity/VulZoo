    "description": "This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Calendar Manager RPC Service. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the CMSD server (rpc.cmsd) which listens by default on UDP port 32768. The process does not properly handle large XDR-encoded ASCII strings to RPC call 10 followed by RPC call 6. This can be abused by an attacker to overflow a buffer on the remote host. Successful exploitation can result in arbitrary code execution.",
