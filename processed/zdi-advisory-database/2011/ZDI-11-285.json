    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell GroupWise. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nMultiple flaws exist within the gwwww1.dll module responsible for parsing VCALENDAR data within e-mail messages. When encountering a RRULE, COMMENT, or TZNAME parameter a static sized memory buffer is allocated. Insufficient checks are performed to ensure the size of the parameter's value can be contained in this buffer. An attacker can overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
