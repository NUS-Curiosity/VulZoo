    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the rcsL chunk inside Adobe's RIFF-based Director file format. The code within the IML32.dll is affected by an integer overflow caused by the allocation of the input size plus 1 and the subsequent copying of the input string using the original size. The given size will wrap, causing a small buffer to be allocated. This can lead to memory corruption which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.",
