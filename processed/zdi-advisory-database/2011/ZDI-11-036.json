    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM DB2. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the db2dasrrm component which listens by default on TCP port 524. When allocating a buffer within receiveDASMessage a user supplied length is used as a parameter to malloc(). This buffer is later copied into without any bounds checking and can be made to overflow. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the das user user.",
