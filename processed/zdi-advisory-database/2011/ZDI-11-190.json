    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Oracle Java Runtime running on OSX or Linux. This vulnerability does not affect java running on Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way java handles color profiles. When parsing a color profile containing a invalid 'crdi' tag it is possible to specify a value that can cause an integer to wrap. This integer is then used to specify the size of a heap allocation. By providing a specially crafted tag value an attacker can cause memory corruption that can lead to remote code being executed under to user running the browser.",
