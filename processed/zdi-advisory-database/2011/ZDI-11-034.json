    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Performance Insight Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific vulnerability is due to a hidden account present within the com.trinagy.security.XMLUserManager Java class. Using this account a malicious user can access the com.trinagy.servlet.HelpManagerServlet class. This is defined within the piweb.jar file installed with Performance Insight. This class exposes a doPost() method which an attacker can use to upload malicious files to the server. Accessing these files can then lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
