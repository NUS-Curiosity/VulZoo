    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Webkit as utilized by either Apple Safari, or Google's Chrome browser. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the library handles implicitly defined styles. When processing a specific case for a style, the application will dispatch an event. During this dispatch, code can be executed that can be used to manipulate the DOM tree causing a type-switch. This type-switch can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
