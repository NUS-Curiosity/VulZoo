    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle GoldenGate Veridata. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way the application parses an XML soap request used for authorization to the management site. While copying string data from a tag into a buffer, the application will terminate the copy only when the byte being copied is of the value 0x20. By crafting a large enough string without this terminator, an attacker can exploit this to execute remote code under the context of the application.",
