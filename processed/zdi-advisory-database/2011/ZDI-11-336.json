    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when a user attempts to play a malicious video file containing a malformed codec name. When playing a malformed codec, the application will incorrectly free an object and then later attempt to use it by calling a virtual method pointer upon destruction. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.\n  ",
