    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Realnetworks Realplayer SP. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the vidplin.dll module. A buffer is allocated according to the user supplied length value. User supplied data is then copied into the allocated buffer, without verifying length, allowing the data to be written past the bounds of the previously allocated buffer. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running RealPlayer.",
