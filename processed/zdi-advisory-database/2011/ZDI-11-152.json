    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers directory traversal on vulnerable installations of HP OpenView Data Protector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThis specific flaw exists in the Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe). The Backup Client Service listens on TCP port 5555 for communications between systems in the cell. The process has insufficient sanitization on user-supplied data when handling certain messages. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted filename strings to the target, which would allow attackers to view or download arbitrary files on the target system.",
