    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple Quicktime. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Quicktime decodes flic file. Flic files can contain FLC Delta Decompression block containing Run Length Encoded data. When Quicktime tries to decompress this data it reads a user supplied RLE Packet count field from the file and uses that as loop counter. A high value for this field will cause Quicktime to write outside previously allocated memory which could result into remote code execution.\n  ",
