    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within the nipplib.dll component. When handling the exposed method GetDriverSettings the application assembles a string for logging consisting of the hostname/port provided as a parameter. When building this message the process will blindly copy user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser.\n  ",
