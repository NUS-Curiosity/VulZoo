    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP 3com/H3C Intelligent Management Center. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the tftpserver.exe component which listens by default on UDP port 69. When handling the opcode word of a packet the process uses this value as a lookup into a function pointer table. The process then calls into the calculated address. By supplying a large or invalid value a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
