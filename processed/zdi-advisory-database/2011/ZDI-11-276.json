    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within the sequenceParameterSetNALUnit component. When handling the num_ref_frames_in_pic_order_cnt_cycle value the size is not validated and the process blindly copies user supplied data from offset_for_ref_frame into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser.",
