    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code from the context of kernelspace on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. The ability to make a system call is required in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the kernel's support for Trace Events. Due to a bad type conversion, the kernel will use a truncated length for allocating data from userspace. When populating this buffer the kernel will use a differing length causing a buffer overflow. This will cause memory corruption and can lead to code execution under the context of the kernel.",
