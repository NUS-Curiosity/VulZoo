    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the application's implementation of an image format supported by the Universal 3D compressed file format. When decoding the image data provided by the file, the application will use a supplied size for allocating space for the destination buffer and then trust the data when decompressing into that buffer. Due to the decompression being unbounded by the actual buffer size, a buffer overflow can be triggered leading to code execution under the context of the application.",
