    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the ovas.exe component which listens by default on TCP port 7510. When handling the Source Node or Destination Node name POST variables the process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack.
