    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within construction of a specific ActionScript3 object. Due to improper type checking in the implementation of the constructor, an alternative type can be provided as an argument to the constructor and stored as a property. When this object is applied to a bitmap copy, the application will corrupt memory. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
