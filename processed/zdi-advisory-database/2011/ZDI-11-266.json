    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists due to the application using a size defined in a header in order to allocate some number of bytes. When processing an AAC raw_data_frame, the application will use the product of the original length and a field inside one of its elements. During the copy operation, this length will be larger than the amount that was allocated for which will cause a buffer overflow and can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
