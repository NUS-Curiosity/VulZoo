    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists when the application attempts to parse a height out of the RV10 codec object. The application will incorrectly treat the value as a signed integer and will its value as the count within a loop that populates rows of sample data within a buffer. This can allow for memory corruption which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.\n  ",
