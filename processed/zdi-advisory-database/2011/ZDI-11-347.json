    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Office Word 2007/2010. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application handles a border containing a specific property. When parsing this property, the application will incorrectly free it. If the application attempts to render the object, a use-after-free condition can be made to occur. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.\n  ",
