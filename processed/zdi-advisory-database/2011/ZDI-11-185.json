    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way java handles color profiles. When parsing a color profile containing a invalid 'bfd ' tag it is possible to specify an integer that can cause an integer to wrap. This integer is then used to specify the size of a heap allocation. By providing a specially crafted tag value an attacker can cause memory corruption that can lead to remote code being executed under to user running the browser.",
