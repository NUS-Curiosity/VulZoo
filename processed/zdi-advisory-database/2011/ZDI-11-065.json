    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within AcroRd32.dll. Initially, a pointer passed to memset can be miscalculated and the resulting copy operation corrupts heap memory. Later, the application attempts to use the modified data which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user invoking the Reader application.",
