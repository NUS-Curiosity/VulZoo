    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Citrix EdgeSight. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe flaw exists within the LauncherService.exe component which listens by default on TCP port 18747. When handling a request the process trusts a user supplied field in the packet specifying the length of data to follow, the process then copies the user supplied data, without validation, into a fixed-length buffer on the heap. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
