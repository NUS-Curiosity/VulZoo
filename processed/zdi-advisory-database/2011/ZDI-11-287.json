    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the caching implementation of a Select element. When modifying this cache, there are certain methods that do not update the cache correctly. Due to these inconsistencies, one can desynchronize the cache with elements that have been freed. While using these freed elements, the application's perception of type-safety becomes skewed and usage of the object can lead to code execution under the context of the application.\n  ",
