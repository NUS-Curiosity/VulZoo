    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP 3COM/H3C Intelligent Management Center. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within the img.exe component which listens by default on TCP port 8800.
