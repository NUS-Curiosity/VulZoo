    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple Safari's Webkit. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the library's support of SVG markers. When updating a marker, the application will duplicate the reference of an object without updating it's reference count. When freeing this object, a use-after-free vulnerability can be made to occur. This can be leveraged by a remote attacker to execute code under the context of the user running the application.",
