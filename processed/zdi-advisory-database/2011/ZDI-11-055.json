    "description": "This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute remote code on vulnerable installations of the Hewlett-Packard Data Protector client. User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the filtering of arguments to the EXEC_CMD command. The Data Protector client allows remote connections to execute files within it's local bin directory. By supplying maliciously crafted input to the EXEC_CMD a remote attacker can interact with a Perl interpreter and execute arbitrary code under the context of the current user.",
