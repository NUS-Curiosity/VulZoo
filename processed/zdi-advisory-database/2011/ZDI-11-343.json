    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Realplayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the mp4arender.dll module. If the channel count is altered inside the esds atom, the allocated buffer will be too small to support the decoded audio data, causing a heap overflow. This vulnerability can be leveraged to execute code under the context of the user running the application.\n  ",
