    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Cisco Unified Service Monitor due to bundled EMC SMARTS application server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe flaw exists within the brstart.exe service which listens by default on TCP port 9002. When handling the authentication portion of a SMARTS request the process extracts a user provided value to allocate a buffer via sm_read_string_length then blindly copies user supplied data into this buffer on the heap. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the service.\n  ",
