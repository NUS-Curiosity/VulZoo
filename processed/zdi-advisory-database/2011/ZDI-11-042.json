User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the application's usage of a specific field used for incrementing an index used in an array. Due to the application failing to verify the usage of the index into the array, the application will copy the contents of the specified element into a statically sized buffer on the stack.
