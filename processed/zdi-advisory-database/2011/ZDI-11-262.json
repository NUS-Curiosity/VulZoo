    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the vxsvc.exe process. The problem affecting the part of the server running on TCP port 2148 is an integer overflow in the function vxveautil.value_binary_unpack where a 32-bit field holds a value that, through some calculation, can be used to create a smaller heap buffer than required to hold user-supplied data. This can be leveraged to cause an overflow of the heap buffer, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of SYSTEM.",
