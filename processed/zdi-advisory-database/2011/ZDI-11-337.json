    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks Real Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application parses sample data encoded with the RV30 codec. When parsing this sample data, the application will make an allocation and then fail to completely initialize the buffer. During decoding of the sample data, the application will explicitly trust an index from the partially filled buffer and then use that to calculate an address to write to. This can lead to memory corruption which can be converted into code execution under the context of the application.\n  ",
