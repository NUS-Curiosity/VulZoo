    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple Safari Webkit. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the library's implementation of a FrameOwner element. When building this tree, the application will create a duplicate reference of an element. By freeing the referenced element, a use-after-free condition can be made to occur which can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
