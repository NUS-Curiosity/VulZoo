    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Adobe Shockwave Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the TextXtra.x32 module responsible for parsing text elements within RIFF-based Director files. The code within this module trusts various length and count values present in the file. A boundary error exists when processing the data section of DEMX chunks, which subsequently leads to a stack-based buffer overflow. This can be leveraged to execute remote code under the context of the user running the browser.",
