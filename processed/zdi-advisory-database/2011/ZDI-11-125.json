User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within how the application handles an exception within the PersistDirectoryEntry records when loading a presentation. When an entry points to a container containing a Slide with a malformed record, the application will raise an exception during the loading of the record.
