    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within js3250.dll. In the JSON.stringify() call chain js_HasOwnProperty() is called with an invalid pointer. The pointer becomes invalid due to being unrooted and garbage collection occurring. Dereferecing of this pointer allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the browser.",
