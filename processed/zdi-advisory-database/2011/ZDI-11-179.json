    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell iPrint Client. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within the nipplib component which is used by both the ActiveX and Netscape compatible browser plugins. When handling the iprint-client-config-info parameter from the user specified printer-url the process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the browser.",
