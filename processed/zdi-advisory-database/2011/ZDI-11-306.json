    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle Java. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way Java handles IIOP deserialization. Due to insufficient type checking it is possible to trick java into allowing access to otherwise protected and private fields in built-in objects. This could be used, for example, to disable to security manager normally in place for applets. This leads to remote code execution under the context of the current user.\n  ",
