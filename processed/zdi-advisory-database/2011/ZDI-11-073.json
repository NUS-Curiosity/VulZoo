    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe flaw exists within the ICC parsing component of ACE.dll. It is possible to cause an integer overflow due to several multiplications of controlled byte values. This leads to the allocation of a small buffer which can subsequently be overflowed. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running Reader.",
