    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Cisco WebEx Player. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within atdl2006.dll. The vulnerability is caused by lack of validation when parsing WRF files. A specially crafted WRF file will cause the application to incorrectly push a size value to a memcpy, allowing for corruption of heap memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the target system under the context of the current user.\n  ",
