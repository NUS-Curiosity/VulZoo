    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec IM Manager. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability in that a logged in user must be coerced into visiting a malicious link.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ScheduleTask method exposed by the IMAdminSchedTask.asp page hosted on the web interface. This function does not properly sanitize user input from a POST variable before passing it to an eval call. An attacker can abuse this to inject and execute arbitrary ASP under the context of the user visiting the malicious link.",
