    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Novell ZENWorks. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists due to the inclusion and usage of an antique ActiveX control (mscomct2.ocx: Tue Mar 14 18:39:28 2000). Though mscomct2.ocx has been killbitted, it is accessed by ZENWorks via an intermediate control (ISList.ISAvi) which is scriptable. Multiple vulnerabilities in mscomct2.ocx can be exploited to execute arbitrary code on the host system in the context of the browser.\n  ",
