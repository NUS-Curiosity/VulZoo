    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of CA Total Defense Suite. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the UnAssignFunctionalRoles stored procedure, accessed via the management.asmx console. The Management Web Service listens for SOAP 1.2 requests on port 34444 for HTTP and 34443 for HTTPS. Due to a flaw in the implementation of the UnAssignFunctionalUsers stored procedure, it is possible for a remote, un-authenticated user to inject arbitrary SQL commands in the SOAP request which could ultimately lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user by invoking an exec function.",
