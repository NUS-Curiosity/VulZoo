    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of RealNetworks RealPlayer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the way RealPlayer handles DEFINEFONT fields in Flash Files. When the process parses corrupt a ShapeRecord with the DefineFont record it reads outside a stack buffer and uses a random stack value as a heap pointer. Later this pointer will be used to write data into. The resulting corruption can lead to remote code execution under the context of the current user.",
