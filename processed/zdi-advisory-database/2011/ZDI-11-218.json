    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the application explicitly trusting a string's length embedded within a particular file that is loaded by the tesselate.x3d plugin. The application will duplicate an arbitrarily sized string from the file into a statically sized buffer located on the stack. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application.",
