    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Sybase M-Business Anywhere. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the gsoap.exe module exposed by the webserver that listens by default on TCP ports 8093 and 8094. A remote user can send an specially crafted SOAP packet with an invalid 'password' closing tag via a POST request to the web server to trigger a buffer overflow in this module. Exploitation of this issue leads to remote code execution under the context of the target service.",
