    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Microsoft 3D Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of PLY files. Crafted data in a PLY file can trigger a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process at low integrity.",
