    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a brute force condition on affected installations of Linux Kernel. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability, but only systems with ksmbd enabled are vulnerable.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of asynchronous connections. The issue results from the lack of protection of an authentication mechanism. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to brute force the credentials on the system.",
