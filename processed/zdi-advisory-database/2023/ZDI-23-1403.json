    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Azure DevOps Server. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the MachinePropertyBag class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account.",
