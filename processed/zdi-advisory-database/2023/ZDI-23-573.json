    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create a denial-of-service condition on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of relocation tables in PE files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow when performing a bounds check before reading from memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create a persistent denial-of-service condition on the system.",
