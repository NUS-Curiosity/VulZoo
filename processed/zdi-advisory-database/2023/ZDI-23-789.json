    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Delta Electronics CNCSoft-B. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of DPA files by the DOPSoft executable. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer.
