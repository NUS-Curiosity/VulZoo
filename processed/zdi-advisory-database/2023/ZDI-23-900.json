    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of nft chains. The issue results from incorrect pointer scaling, which can result in a memory access past the end of an array. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
