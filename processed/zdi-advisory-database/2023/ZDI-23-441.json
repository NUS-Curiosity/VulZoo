    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within a fault handler. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an array. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
