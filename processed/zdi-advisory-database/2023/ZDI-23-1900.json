    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code via Bluetooth on affected installations of BlueZ. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect to a malicious device.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the AVRCP protocol. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.",
