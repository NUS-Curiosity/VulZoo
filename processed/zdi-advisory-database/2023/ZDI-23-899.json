    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of nft_chains. The issue results from the lack of validating the status of a chain while processing lookup on the chain. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
