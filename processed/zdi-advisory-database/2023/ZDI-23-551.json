    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Canon imageCLASS MF743Cdw printers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the CADM service, which listens on TCP port 9013 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account.",
