    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft 3D Builder. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of PLY files. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object.
