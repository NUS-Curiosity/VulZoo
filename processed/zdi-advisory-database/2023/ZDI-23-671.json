    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files on affected installations of Delta Industrial Automation DIALink. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the opcua endpoint of the web service, which listens on TCP port 5000 by default. When parsing the filename parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to create files in the context of the web service.",
