    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Lexmark MC3224i printers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the PostScript putinterval command. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device.",
