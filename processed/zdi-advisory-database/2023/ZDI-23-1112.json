    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. Furthermore, exploitation is possible only in limited circumstances.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of unhandled exceptions. By redirecting a DOS device, an attacker can abuse a high-privileged service to launch an arbitrary executable.
