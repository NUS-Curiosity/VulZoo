    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Canonical ksmbd-tools. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of the LSARPC_OPNUM_LOOKUP_SID2 opcode. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.",
