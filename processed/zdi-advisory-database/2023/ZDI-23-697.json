    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack a session on affected installations of Linux Kernel. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability, but only systems with ksmbd enabled are vulnerable.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of Session ID within Multichannel.
