    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TP-Link AX1800 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of firmware images. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
