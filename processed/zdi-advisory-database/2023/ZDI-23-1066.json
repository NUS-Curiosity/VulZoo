    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must connect a malicious Bluetooth device.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of AVDTP commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before reading from memory. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
