    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Extreme Networks AP410C routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ah_acsd service, which listens on TCP port 5916 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
