    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Canon imageCLASS MF743Cdw printers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within handling of mDNS packets. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
