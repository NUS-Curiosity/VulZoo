    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Wecon PI Studio HMI Project Programmer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of PI Studio Project files. When parsing the TextContent field, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
