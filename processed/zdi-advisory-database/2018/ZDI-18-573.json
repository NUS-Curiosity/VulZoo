    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the creation of a device context from memory using the D3DKMTCreateDCFromMemory API. When processing the width parameter, the process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to SYSTEM.\n  ",
