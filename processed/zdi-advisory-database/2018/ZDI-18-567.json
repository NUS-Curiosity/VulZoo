    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Qemu. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute code on the guest OS in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the slirp networking. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code under the context of current user in the host OS.\n  ",
