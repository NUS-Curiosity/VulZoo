    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the SHCRGL_GUEST_FN_WRITE_READ_BUFFERED method. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute code under the context of the hypervisor.\n  ",
