    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Apple iOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the backboardd service. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object.
