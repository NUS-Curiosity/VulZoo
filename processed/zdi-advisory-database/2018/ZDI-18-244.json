An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the win32k.sys driver. During creation of a palette object, a race condition exists due to the failure to lock an object in memory between operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to the level of SYSTEM.\n  ",
