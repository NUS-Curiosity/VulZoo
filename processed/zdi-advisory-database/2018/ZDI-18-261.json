    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of OMRON CX-Supervisor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of SCS project files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
