    "description": "    This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Wecon LeviStudioU. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within DataLogTool.exe. During the Edit procedure, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
