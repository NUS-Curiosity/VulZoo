    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of OMRON CX-One. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of FLN files. When parsing the Node Name field, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
