    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit PhantomPDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of PDF documents. When parsing shading patterns, the process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
