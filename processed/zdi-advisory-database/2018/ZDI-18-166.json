    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to deny service to vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. In some cases, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file, but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.\nThe specific flaw exists within the mrxsmb.sys driver.
