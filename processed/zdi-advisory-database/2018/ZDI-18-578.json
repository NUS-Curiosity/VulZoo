    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of ksecdd IOCTL 0x390400, which is implemented in cng.sys. Crafted parameters to this IOCTL can trigger a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.\n  ",
