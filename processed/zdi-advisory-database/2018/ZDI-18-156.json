    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Apple iOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the backboardd service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code under the context of root.\n  ",
