    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the crServerDispatchDeleteTextures method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code under the context of the hypervisor.\n  ",
