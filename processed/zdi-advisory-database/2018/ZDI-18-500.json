    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privilege on vulnerable installations of Advantech WebAccess Node. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the access control that is set and modified during the installation of the product. The product installation weakens access control restrictions of pre-existing system files and sets weak access control restrictions on new files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of Administrator, the IUSR account, or SYSTEM.\n  ",
