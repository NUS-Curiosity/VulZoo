    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Advantech WebAccess Node. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the GetUnackAlarmsByPage function in BWMobileService.dll.  When parsing the ProjectName parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries.
