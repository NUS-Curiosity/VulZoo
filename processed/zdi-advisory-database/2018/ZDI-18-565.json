    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro OfficeScan. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x2200B4 in the TMWFP driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to using that length to initialize a pool-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to kernel.\n  ",
