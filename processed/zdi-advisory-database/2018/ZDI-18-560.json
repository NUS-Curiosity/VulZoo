    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Samsung Galaxy Apps. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of a staging mode. The issue lies in the ability to change the configuration based on the presence of a file in an user-controlled location. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the application.\n  ",
