    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escape the sandbox on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Edge. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists due to the fact that various operations can be triggered from within the Microsoft Edge sandbox. Considered individually, these operations do not pose a risk. However, they can be used in combination to produce an unsafe result. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code under the context of the current user at medium integrity.\n  ",
