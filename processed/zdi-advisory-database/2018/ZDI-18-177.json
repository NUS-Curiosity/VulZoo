    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Pro DC. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of EMR_STRETCHDIBITS structures within EMF files. When parsing the cySrc, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
