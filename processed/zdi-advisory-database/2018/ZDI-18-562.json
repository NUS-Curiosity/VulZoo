    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Samsung Members. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of Intents. The issue lies in the ability to send an Intent that would not otherwise be reachable.
