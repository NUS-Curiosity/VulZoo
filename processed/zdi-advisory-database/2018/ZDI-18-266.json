    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Maximum Security.  An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of IOCTL 0x22205C by the tmnciesc.sys driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally protected from the application.\n  ",
