    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of OMRON CX-One. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of PSW files. When parsing a crafted file, the process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
