    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Apple Safari. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of ResourceRequest objects. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code under the context of the user.\n  ",
