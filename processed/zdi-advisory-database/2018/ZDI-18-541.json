    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of GE MDS PulseNET. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the MagnumEmulator servlet. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a specially crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information under the context of the service.\n  ",
