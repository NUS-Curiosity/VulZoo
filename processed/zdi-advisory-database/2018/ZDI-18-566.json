    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro OfficeScan. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of IOCTL 0x220004 by the tmwfp driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.  An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to SYSTEM. \n  ",
