    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Encryption for Email Gateway. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the formChangePass class. When parsing the username parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to disclose sensitive information under the context of the database.\n  ",
