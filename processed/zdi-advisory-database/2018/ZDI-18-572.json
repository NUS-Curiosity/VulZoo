    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the DirectX graphics kernel driver, dxgkrnl.sys. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to the level of SYSTEM.\n  ",
