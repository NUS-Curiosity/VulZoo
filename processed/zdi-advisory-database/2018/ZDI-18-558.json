    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Samsung Galaxy Apps. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of URLs. The issue lies in the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can allow arbitrary JavaScript to execute. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to install applications under the context of the current user.\n  ",
