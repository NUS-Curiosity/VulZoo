    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of SAP MaxDB. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of UDL files by the Data Link Properties dialog. When parsing the Servername element, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the process.\n  ",
