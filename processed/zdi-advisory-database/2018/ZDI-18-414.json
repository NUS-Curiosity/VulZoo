    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL statements on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Encryption of Email Gateway. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the formEditPolicy class. When parsing the hidRuleId parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries.
