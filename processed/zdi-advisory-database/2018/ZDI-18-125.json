    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of WECON LeviStudioU. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of LeviStudioU Project files. When providing an overly long MulStatus szFilename XML attribute, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
