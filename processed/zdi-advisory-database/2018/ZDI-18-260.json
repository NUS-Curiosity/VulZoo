    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of OMRON CX-Supervisor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of CDM file. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
