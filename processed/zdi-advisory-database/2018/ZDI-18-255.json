    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of OMRON CX-Supervisor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of SCS project files. When parsing a malformed Alarm object, the process does not properly validate the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
