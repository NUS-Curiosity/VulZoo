    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Control Manager. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within cgiRedAlertStatusTracking.exe.  The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SQL Server database user.\n  ",
