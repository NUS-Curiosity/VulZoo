    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Chakra. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the JavaScript eval function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
