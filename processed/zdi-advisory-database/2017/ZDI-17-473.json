    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of PlgBlt, an operation that writes bitmap graphics to parallelogram-shaped destination areas. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privilege to the level of SYSTEM.\n  ",
