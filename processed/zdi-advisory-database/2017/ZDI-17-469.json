    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of memory allocations in dxgkrnl.sys. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privilege to the level of SYSTEM.\n  ",
