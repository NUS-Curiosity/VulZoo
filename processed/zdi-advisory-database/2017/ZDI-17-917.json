    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the EngLockSurface API. Performing a memory write at an unexpected time during the execution of EngLockSurface can cause the kernel to read from an improper address. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.\n  ",
