    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within Collab's shareFile function. The issue occurs when a PDF file is opened from the Cloud. The Collab.shareFile function does not properly check the file path, which results in reading arbitrary memory. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.\n  ",
