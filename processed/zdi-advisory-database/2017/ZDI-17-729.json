    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows PDF Library. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of JPEG2000 graphics inside PDF documents. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the process.\n  ",
