    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to deny service on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Maximum Security. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x00222813 in tmusa.sys. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied value prior to dereferencing it as a pointer. An attacker can leverage this to deny service to the system.\n  ",
