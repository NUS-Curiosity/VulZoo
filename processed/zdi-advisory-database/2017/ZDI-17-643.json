    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Fuji Electric Monitouch V-SFT.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within parsing of a V8 project file. The issue lies in the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
