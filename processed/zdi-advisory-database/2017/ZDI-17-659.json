    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Intelligent Management Center. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the beanName parameter provided to the selectUserGroup.xhtml endpoint. When parsing the beanName parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to render a page.
