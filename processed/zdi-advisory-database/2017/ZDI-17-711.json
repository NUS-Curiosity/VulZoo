    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of EMC Data Protection Advisor. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be easily bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the EMC DPA Application service, which listens on TCP port 9002 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose any files accessible to the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
