    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Adobe Digital Editions. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of JPEG2000 images embedded in ePub files. The process does not properly validate user-supplied data which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object.
