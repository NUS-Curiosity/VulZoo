    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro OfficeScan. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Web Console, which listens on TCP port 4343 by default. When parsing the T parameter in Proxy.php, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call.
