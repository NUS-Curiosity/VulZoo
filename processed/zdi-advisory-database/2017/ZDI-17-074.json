    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Control Manager. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of ProgressReportCGI.exe. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to discover the name and the hashed password of the administrative user. \n  ",
