    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of SVGA graphics. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code under the context of the hypervisor.\n  ",
