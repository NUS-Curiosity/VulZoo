    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of EMC Appsync. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be easily bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within Apollo REST services, which listens on TCP port 8445 by default. When parsing the  query request parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information under the context of SYSTEM.\n  ",
