    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro OfficeScan. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of IOCTL 0x22006C within tmwfp.sys. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to resources normally reserved for the kernel.\n  ",
