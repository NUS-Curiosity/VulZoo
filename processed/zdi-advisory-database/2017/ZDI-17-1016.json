    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Chakra. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the generation of JIT code for functions that manipulate typed arrays. By performing actions in JavaScript, an attacker can cause a pointer to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
