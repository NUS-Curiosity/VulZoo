    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ThinPrint. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within JPEG2000 parsing. The process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the host OS.\n  ",
