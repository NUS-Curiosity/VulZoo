    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files on vulnerable installations of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Intelligent Management Center. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within mibFileServlet servlet, which listens on TCP ports 8080 and 8443 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete any files accessible to SYSTEM.\n  ",
