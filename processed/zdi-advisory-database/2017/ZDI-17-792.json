Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of the eas_agent_register action. When parsing the 'slink_id' field, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries in a later show_eas_agent_info request.
