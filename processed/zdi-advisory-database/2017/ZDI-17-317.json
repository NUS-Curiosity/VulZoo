    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Intelligent Management Center. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the HPE iMC Server service, which listens on UDP port 6666 by default. When parsing the SSID attribute, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
