    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on vulnerable installations of Apple macOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the WindowServer process. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges under the context of the WindowServer.\n  ",
