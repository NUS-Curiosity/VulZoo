    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to overwrite files on vulnerable installations of NetGain Systems Enterprise Manager. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the org.apache.jsp.u.jsp.reports.templates.network.traffic_005freport_jsp servlet, which listens on TCP port 8081 by default. When parsing the filename parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to overwrite any files accessible to the Administrator.\n  ",
