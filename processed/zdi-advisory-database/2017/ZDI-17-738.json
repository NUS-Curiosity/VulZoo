    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Shader implementation. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the host OS.\n  ",
