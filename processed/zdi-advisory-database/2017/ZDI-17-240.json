    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Linux Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of xfrm states. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code under the context of the kernel.\n  ",
