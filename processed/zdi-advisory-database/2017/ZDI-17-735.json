    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within vPlgWrite1 in the win32kfull driver. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code under the context of SYSTEM.\n  ",
