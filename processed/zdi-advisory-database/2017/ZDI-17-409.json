    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of OpenType Layout (OTL) data in font files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read outside an allocated object.
