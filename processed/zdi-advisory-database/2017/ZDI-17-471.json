    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the win32kfull!CopyOutputString function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privilege to the level of SYSTEM.\n  ",
