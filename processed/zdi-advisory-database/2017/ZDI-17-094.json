Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of SHA1DenyDetectionResult.xhtml. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries.
