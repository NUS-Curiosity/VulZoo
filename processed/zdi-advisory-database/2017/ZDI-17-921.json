    "description": "    This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the NAT IP Fragment Reassembly. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code under the context of SYSTEM in the host OS.\n  ",
