    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Flash. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within SWF parsing. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.\n  ",
