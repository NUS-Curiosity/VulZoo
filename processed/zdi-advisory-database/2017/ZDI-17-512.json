    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mitsubishi Electric E-Designer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within processing of a driver configuration file when initializing the BEGalil component. When parsing the property IPAddress, the process fails to properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Administrator.\n  ",
