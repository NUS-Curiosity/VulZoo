    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to escape the AppContainer sandbox on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Edge. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the IBrowserBroker::WriteClassesOfCategory method. Executing this method can cause the broker process to load a module from an unqualified path. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code under the context of the user at medium integrity.\n  ",
