    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Trend Micro Control Manager. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within BasePageSessionExpire.cs. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) reference, a specially crafted URI causes the XML parser to access the contents of this URI and embed these contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information under the context of the current process.\n  ",
