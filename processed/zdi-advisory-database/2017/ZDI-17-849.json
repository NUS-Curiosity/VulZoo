    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Intelligent Management Center. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be easily bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the flexFileUpload servlet, which listens on TCP port 8080 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of root.\n  ",
