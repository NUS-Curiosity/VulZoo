    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Eaton ELCSoft. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of a Device Comment Range record in an EPC file. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write to an arbitrary address. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the process.\n  ",
