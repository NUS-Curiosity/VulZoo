    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Lexmark MC3224i printers. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the remote object server. The issue results from the lack of an appropriate expiration mechanism for session IDs. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the web admin user.",
