    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of FreeBSD Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of arguments to the MPT device. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
