Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the AMF protocol. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing.
