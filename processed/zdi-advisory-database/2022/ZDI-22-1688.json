    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Linux Kernel. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of file attributes. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the kernel.",
