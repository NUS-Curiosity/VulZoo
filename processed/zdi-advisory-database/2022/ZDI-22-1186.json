    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of ConnMan. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the wispr_portal_web_result method. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing further free operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the ConnMan process.  \nThis vulnerability was demonstrated on a Tesla Model 3 during Pwn2Own 2022 Vancouver competition.",
