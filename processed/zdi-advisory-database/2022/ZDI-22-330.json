    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Lexmark MC3224i printers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of packet captures. When parsing the filter property, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the www-data user.",
