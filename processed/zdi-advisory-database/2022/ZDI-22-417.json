    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Cisco RV340 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the update-clients method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call.
