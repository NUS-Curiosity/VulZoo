    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of VMware ESXi. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target host system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the TCPIP kernel module. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of kernel.",
