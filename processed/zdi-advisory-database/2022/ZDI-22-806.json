    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of FreeBSD Kernel. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of 802.11 Wi-Fi beacon frames. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the kernel.",
