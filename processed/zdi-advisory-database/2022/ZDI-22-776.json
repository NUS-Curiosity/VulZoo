    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Ivanti Avalanche. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the JwtTokenUtility class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account.",
