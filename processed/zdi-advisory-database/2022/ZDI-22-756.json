    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Cisco RV340 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of set-snmp JSON RPC requests. When parsing the usmUserEngineID parameter, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the www-data user.",
