    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Delta Industrial Automation DRAS. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of XML files within Point Table processing.  Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose files in the context of the current process.",
