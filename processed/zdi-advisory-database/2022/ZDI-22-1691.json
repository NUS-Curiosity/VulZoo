    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Linux Kernel. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of SMB2_WRITE commands. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
