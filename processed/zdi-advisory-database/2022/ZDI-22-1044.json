    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of ICONICS GENESIS64 GenBroker64. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the GenBroker64 service, which listens on TCP port 38080 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
