    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Schneider Electric IGSS. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the IGSSDataServer process, which listens on TCP port 12401 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the IGSSDataServer process.",
