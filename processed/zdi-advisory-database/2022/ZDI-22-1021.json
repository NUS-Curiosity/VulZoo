    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of VMware ESXi. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the TCP/IP kernel module. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the kernel.",
