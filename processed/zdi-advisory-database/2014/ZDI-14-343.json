    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within ovopi.dll which listens by default on UDP port 696. When parsing command number 685, the process blindly copies user supplied data which can be used to overwrite a vtable or any arbitrary address. A remote attacker can abuse this to execute remote code under the context of the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
