    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the AcroPDF ActiveX control.  The issue lies in the messageHandler property of the control.  By manipulating the messageHandler's attributes an attacker can force a dangling pointer to be reused after it has been freed.   An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
