    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Avaya IP Office one-X Portal. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the UserConfigurationService and UploadFromLocalDriveServlet servlets.  The UserConfigurationService servlet does not properly validate user-supplied data allowing for the super user account to be reset.  The UploadFromLocalDriveServlet servlet also fails to validate user-supplied data allowing for arbitrary file writes with SYSTEM level privileges.  An attacker can leverage these vulnerabilities to execute code with SYSTEM level privileges.\n  ",
