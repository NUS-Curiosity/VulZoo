    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe issue lies in CElement::DelMarkupPtr which expects a CMarkup object at a certain offset. By calling CElement::DelMarkupPtr more than once an attacker can force type confusion that leads to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
