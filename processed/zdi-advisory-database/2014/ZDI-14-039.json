    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM SPSS SamplePower.  User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the IBM SPSS SamplePower VSFlexGrid8.VSFlexGridL ActiveX control.  The control performs insufficient bounds checking on user-supplied data passed into the ComboList or ColComboList methods before copying it to a fixed-length buffer in global memory.  An attacker can exploit this condition to achieve code execution under the context of the browser process.\n  ",
