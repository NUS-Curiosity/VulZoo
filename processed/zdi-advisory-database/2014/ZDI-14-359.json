    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP Sprinter. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability is found in Tidestone Formula One ActiveX controls, which are installed as a part of HP Sprinter. By assigning an overly-long value to the DefaultFontName property provided by those controls, an attacker can write attacker-supplied data into memory outside of correct bounds. An attacker can leverage this to execute code in the context of the browser.\n  ",
