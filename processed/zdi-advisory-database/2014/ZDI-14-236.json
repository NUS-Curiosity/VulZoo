    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apache HTTPD server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the updating of mod_status.  A race condition in mod_status allows an attacker to disclose information or corrupt memory with several requests to endpoints with handler server-status and other endpoints.   By abusing this flaw, an attacker can possibly disclose credentials or leverage this situation to achieve remote code execution.\n  ",
