    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the PTC IsoView ActiveX control. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the arguments to a set of animation related methods. By providing an overly long Object identifier, an attacker can cause a stack buffer overflow. This overflow would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser.\n  ",
