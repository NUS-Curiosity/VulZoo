    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability relates to how Internet Explorer processes the onfocus event of an input element. By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can force a CInput object in memory to be reused after it has been freed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
