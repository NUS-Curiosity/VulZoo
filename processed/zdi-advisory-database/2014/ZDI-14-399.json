    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the PTC IsoView ActiveX control. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ViewPort property of the control. By setting the property to a malicious value, an attacker can overflow a statically allocated heap buffer. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser.\n  ",
