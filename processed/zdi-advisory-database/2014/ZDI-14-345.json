    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Data Protector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within omnidlc.exe which can be called via crs.exe.  The issue lies in the failure to properly validate the size of a string before copying it into a fixed-sized buffer.  A remote attacker can chain this with another vulnerability to execute remote code under the context of the user running Data Protector.\n  ",
