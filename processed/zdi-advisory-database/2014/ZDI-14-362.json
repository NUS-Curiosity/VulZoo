    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Foxit ActiveX Pro SDK ActiveX control. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Foxit.FoxitPDFSDKProCtrl.5 ActiveX control. By passing an overly long string to the SetLogFile method, an attacker is able to overflow global variables in the control. This could be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser.\n  ",
