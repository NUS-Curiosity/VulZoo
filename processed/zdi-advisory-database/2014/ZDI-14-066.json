    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of SolarWinds Server and Application Monitor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the Apex ActiveX control.  The issue lies in a failure to validate the size of input before copying it into a fixed-length buffer on the stack.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current user.\n  ",
