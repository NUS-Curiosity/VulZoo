User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability relates to how Internet Explorer keeps track of in-memory objects representing rows in an HTML table. By manipulating a document's elements an attacker can force a CTableRow object in memory to be reused after it has been freed.
