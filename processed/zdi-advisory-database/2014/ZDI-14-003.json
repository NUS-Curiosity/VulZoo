    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute remote code on vulnerable installations of HP Data Protector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThis specific flaw exists in the Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe). The Backup Client Service listens on TCP port 5555 for communications between systems in the cell. The process has insufficient sanitization on user-supplied data when handling certain messages. Remote, unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a packet to the target that results in a directory traversing arbitrary file write. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
