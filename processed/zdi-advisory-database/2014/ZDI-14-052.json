    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Splunk. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the advanced search functionality. Using a multi-staged attack, it is possible to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system by leveraging a directory traversal flaw in the \"file\" parameter of the \"collect\" script. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code under the context of the process.\n  ",
