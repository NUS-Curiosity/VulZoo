    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service to vulnerable installations of Trihedral VTScada. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \nThe specific flaw exists within the included HTTP server. By providing a small negative content length, an attacker is able to cause an integer overflow, resulting in the allocation of too small a buffer. The resulting heap overwrite will terminate the HTTP server.\n  ",
