    "description": "    This vulnerability potentially allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of EMC AlphaStor for EMC Networker. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within Library Manager (robotd.exe) which listens by default on port 3500. When parsing the 0x4f command, the process copies an arbitrary user supplied string into fixed sized buffers. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability into remote execution of arbitrary code as SYSTEM.\nVendor patched May 2013, but did not notify the ZDI. As a result this advisory is posted late.\n  ",
