    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Universal Configuration Management Database (CMDB).   Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, but it is trivial to bypass.\nThe specific flaw exists in the handling of requests to the Integration Service.  The service exposes the UploadScanServlet which contains a flaw that allows attackers to create files at arbitrary locations with attacker controlled data. This vulnerability can be leveraged by an attacker to gain remote code execution under the context of SYSTEM.\n  ",
