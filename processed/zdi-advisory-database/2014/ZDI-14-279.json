    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard's Application Lifecycle Management. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have an unprivileged account on the Application Lifecycle Management System.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ACLs on a specific installed directory. Because this directory allows any user to create a file, an unprivileged attacker can place a malicious DLL on the system. When the Application Lifecycle Management is restarted, it will execute the provided file in the context of NT Authority\\SYSTEM.\n  ",
