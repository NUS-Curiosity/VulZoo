User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe vulnerability relates to how Internet Explorer handles style attributes which have been set to a value and then emptied. By emptying a style attribute and then performing specific manipulations on the document, an attacker can cause Internet Explorer to read from a memory location which has not been initialized. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
