User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the built-in RPC server implemented in prremote.dll.  This RPC server listens over the 'PRRemote:' RPC endpoint.  Through the RPC server an attacker can insert a specially crafted `call_table_ref` in order to gain code execution.
