    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Internet Explorer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. In addition, the user must allow the web page to access the clipboard when so prompted.\nThe vulnerability relates to how Internet Explorer converts bitmap-format graphics to PNG-format graphics. A web page can define an image using SVG, which, when copied and pasted back into the document, will overflow a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the current process.\n  ",
