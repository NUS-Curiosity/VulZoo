    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Word. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of style tags. By nesting a specific style tag within another, an attacker is able to cause a pointer to be used after the underlying object has been freed. This could be used to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\n  ",
