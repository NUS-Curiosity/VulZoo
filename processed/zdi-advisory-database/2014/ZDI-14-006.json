    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers directory traversal on vulnerable installations of HP OpenView Data Protector. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThis specific flaw exists in the Backup Client Service (OmniInet.exe). The Backup Client Service listens on TCP port 5555 for communications between systems in the cell. Omininet.exe starts vrda.exe for processing vrda request messages. This process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length stack buffer. A remote attacker can abuse this to execute remote code under the context of the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
