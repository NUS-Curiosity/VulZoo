    "description": "    This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on applications which pass user provided data to the vulnerable API in SAP SQL Anywhere.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of a malformed integer constant. If an application allows untrusted input to be used in a query, even if the input is correctly filtered against SQL injection, an attacker could overflow a fixed size stack buffer and execute arbitrary code in the context of the application.\n  ",
