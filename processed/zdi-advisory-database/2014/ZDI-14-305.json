    "description": "    This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard Network Node Manager. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within ovopi.dll which listens by default on UDP port 696. When parsing option -S with a buffer followed by a semi-colon, the process blindly copies user supplied data into a fixed-length buffer. A remote attacker can abuse this to execute remote code under the context of the SYSTEM user.\n  ",
