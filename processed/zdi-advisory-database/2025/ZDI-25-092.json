    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Apple Safari. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the B3 JIT compiler. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow that causes an incorrect optimization. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
