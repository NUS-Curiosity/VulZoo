    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the user-mode printer driver host process splwow64.exe. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges from low integrity and execute code in the context of the current user at medium integrity.",
