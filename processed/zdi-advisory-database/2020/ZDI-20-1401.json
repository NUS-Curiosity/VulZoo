An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the AppleIntelKBLGraphics kext. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure.
