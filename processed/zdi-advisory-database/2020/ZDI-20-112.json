    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Cisco Data Center Network Manager. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of requests to the getjobs endpoint. When parsing the filterStr parameter in the getRpmJobLength method, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to construct SQL queries. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise.",
