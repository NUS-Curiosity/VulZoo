    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Sony X800G Smart TV. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of arrays in Vewd. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
