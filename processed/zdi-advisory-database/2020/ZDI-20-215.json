    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Apple macOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the IO80211Family kernel extension. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges in the context of the kernel.",
