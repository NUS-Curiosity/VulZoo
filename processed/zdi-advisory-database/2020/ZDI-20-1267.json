    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the BDOOR_CMD_PATCH_ACPI_TABLES command. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
