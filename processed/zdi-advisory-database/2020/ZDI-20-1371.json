    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of DirectComposition in the Windows kernel. Crafted parameters to a system call can trigger access to a pointer prior to initialization. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
