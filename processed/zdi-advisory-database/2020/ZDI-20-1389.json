    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Apple macOS. Interaction with the CoreGraphics library is required to exploit this vulnerability but attack vectors may vary depending on the implementation.\nThe specific flaw exists within the JBIG2Stream::readGenericBitmap method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated data structure.
