    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to write arbitrary files on affected installations of Libvirt. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the libvirt service. The issue results from improper access control when handling the vol-upload command, which allows an arbitrary file write with attacker controlled data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of root.",
