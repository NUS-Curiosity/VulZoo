    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of shader bytecode. By manipulating a document's elements, an attacker can trigger a read past the end of an allocated array. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
