    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the vmsvgaR3FifoUpdateCursor function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
