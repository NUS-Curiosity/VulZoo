    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the SVGA DXInvalidateContext command. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
