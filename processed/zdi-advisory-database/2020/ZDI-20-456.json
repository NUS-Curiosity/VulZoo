    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the KERNELBASE.dll module. When parsing the Resource Directory Entry field of a Portable Executable format file, the process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
