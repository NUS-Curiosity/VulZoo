    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose information on affected installations of Parallels Desktop. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the prl_hypervisor kext. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result a pointer to be leaked after the handler is done. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.",
