    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files on affected installations of IBM Informix. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the bts_tracefile function. When parsing the trace filename, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the service account.",
