    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the ThinPrint component. When parsing JPEG2000 codestreams embedded in EMF files, the process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
