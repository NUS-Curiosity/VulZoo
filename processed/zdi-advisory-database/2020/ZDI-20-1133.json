    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft Excel. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of XLS files. When parsing a Shared String Table (SST) record, the process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
