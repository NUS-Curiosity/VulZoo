    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Oracle WebLogic. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of the T3 protocol on TCP port 7001. When deserializing objects embedded with T3 protocol messages, the server allows deserialization of classes that may lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
