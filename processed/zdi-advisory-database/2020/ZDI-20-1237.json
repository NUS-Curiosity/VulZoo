    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of IBM Informix. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the spatial.bld module. When parsing SQL statements, the process does not properly validate user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the informix user.",
