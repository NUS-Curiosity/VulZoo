    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of D-Link DIR-867, DIR-878, and DIR-882 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of HNAP login requests.
