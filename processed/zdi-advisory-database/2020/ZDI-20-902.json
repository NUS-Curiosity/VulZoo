    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the implementation of the e1000 virtual network adapter. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer underflow before writing to memory. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
