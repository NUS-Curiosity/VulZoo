    "description": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of string table file uploads. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in an integer overflow before allocating a buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the admin user.",
    "addtionnal_details": "This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 120 day deadline.\n\n02/05/20 – ZDI disclosed the vulnerability reports to the vendor03/27/20 – The vendor requested an extension until the end of May05/29/20 – The vendor requested an extension until the end of June05/29/20 – ZDI declined the request and notified the vendor the cases would be published as 0-day advisories on 06/08/20\n\n-- Mitigation:Given the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with the service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting.",
