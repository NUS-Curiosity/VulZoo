    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the VBoxVGA graphics controller component. When handling the VBoxVHWASurfaceBase object, the process does not properly validate the existence of the object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
