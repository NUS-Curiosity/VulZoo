    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft Outlook. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious email or view it in the preview pane.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of HTML content in email. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.
