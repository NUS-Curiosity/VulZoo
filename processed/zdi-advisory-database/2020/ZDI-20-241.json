    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Adobe FrameMaker. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.\nThe specific flaw exists within the parsing of CEL files. When parsing CEL files, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, heap-based buffer.  An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
