    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of FreeBSD Kernel. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of arguments to the sendmsg system call. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
