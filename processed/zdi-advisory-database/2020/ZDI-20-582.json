    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Oracle VirtualBox. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of data sent to OHCI endpoints. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it.\n An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the hypervisor.",
