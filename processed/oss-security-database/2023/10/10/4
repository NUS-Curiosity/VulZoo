     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2023-34327,CVE-2023-34328 / XSA-444
                               version 3

                     x86/AMD: Debug Mask handling

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

AMD CPUs since ~2014 have extensions to normal x86 debugging functionality.
Xen supports guests using these extensions.

Unfortunately there are errors in Xen's handling of the guest state, leading
to denials of service.

 1) CVE-2023-34327 - An HVM vCPU can end up operating in the context of
    a previous vCPUs debug mask state.

 2) CVE-2023-34328 - A PV vCPU can place a breakpoint over the live GDT.
    This allows the PV vCPU to exploit XSA-156 / CVE-2015-8104 and lock
    up the CPU entirely.

IMPACT
======

For CVE-2023-34327, any guest (PV or HVM) using Debug Masks normally for
it's own purposes can cause incorrect behaviour in an unrelated HVM
vCPU, most likely resulting in a guest crash.

For CVE-2023-34328, a buggy or malicious PV guest kernel can lock up the
host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only AMD/Hygon hardware supporting the DBEXT feature are vulnerable.
This is believed to be the Steamroller microarchitecture and later.

For CVE-2023-34327, Xen versions 4.5 and later are vulnerable.

For CVE-2023-34328, Xen version between 4.5 and 4.13 are vulnerable.
The issue is benign in Xen 4.14 and later owing to an unrelated change.

MITIGATION
==========

For CVE-2023-34327, HVM VMs which can see the DBEXT feature are not
susceptible to running in the wrong state.  By default, VMs will see the
DBEXT feature on capable hardware, and when not explicitly levelled for
migration compatibility.

For CVE-2023-34328, PV VMs which cannot see the DBEXT feature cannot
leverage the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Andrew Cooper of XenServer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and described above (or others which are
substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on
public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
