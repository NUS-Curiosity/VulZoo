Subject: CVE-2023-42794: Apache Tomcat: FileUpload: DoS due to accumulation of
 temporary files on Windows

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Tomcat 9.0.70 through 9.0.80
- Apache Tomcat 8.5.85 through 8.5.93

Description:

Incomplete Cleanup vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.

The internal fork of Commons FileUpload packaged with Apache Tomcat 
9.0.70 through 9.0.80 and 8.5.85 through 8.5.93 included an unreleased,
in progress refactoring that exposed a potential denial of service on
Windows if a web application opened a stream for an uploaded file but
failed to close the stream. The file would never be deleted from disk
creating the possibility of an eventual denial of service due to the
disk being full.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.0.81 onwards or 8.5.94 
onwards, which fixes the issue.
