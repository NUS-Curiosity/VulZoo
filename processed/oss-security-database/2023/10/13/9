It did not really surprise me that Glenn Strauss, the wonderful
developer of the lighttpd that i use for eight years, had to go
like this (i hope he does not mind i quote #lighttpd here):

  ...
  01:45 < gps> [..]No, I did not have prior knowledge.
  ...
  02:20 < gps> Confirmed: while all web servers implementing
    HTTP/2 are exposed to the attack in CVE-2023-44487, the way each
    web server software processes HTTP/2 affects the size of the
    impact of the attack.  With lighttpd, the impact is largely
    limited to the CPU usage parsing the HTTP/2 HEADERS frame,
    including HPACK decoding.
  ...
  03:58 < gps> To be clear, the attack still causes lighttpd to
    use more resources, but the amplification of resource
    commitment is constrained in lighttpd due to the design
    choices made for lighttpd HTTP/2.
