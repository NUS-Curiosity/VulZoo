Subject: Django: CVE-2023-23969: Potential denial-of-service via
 Accept-Language headers.

https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2023/feb/01/security-releases/

In accordance with `our security release policy
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/>`_, the 
Django team
is issuing
`Django 4.1.6 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/4.1.6/>`_,
`Django 4.0.9 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/4.0.9/>`_, and
`Django 3.2.17 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/3.2.17/>`_.
These releases addresses the security issue detailed below. We encourage all
users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.

CVE-2023-23969: Potential denial-of-service via ``Accept-Language`` headers
===========================================================================

The parsed values of ``Accept-Language`` headers are cached in order to 
avoid
repetitive parsing. This leads to a potential denial-of-service vector via
excessive memory usage if large header values are sent.

In order to avoid this vulnerability, the ``Accept-Language`` header is now
parsed up to a maximum length.

Thanks to Nick Pope for the report and patch.

This issue has severity "moderate" according to the Django security policy.
