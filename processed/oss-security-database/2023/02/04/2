Thank you for this work on sox!
But i was only wondering a bit, have you checked against the
[master] branch?  For example

  02-fix-resource-leak-hcom.patch
  03-fix-regression-in-CVE-2017-11358.patch
  04-fix-hcom-big-endian.patch#
  06-CVE-2021-33844.patch
and
  07-CVE-2021-3643.patch

do not apply against it, and he introduced functions like
dictvalid() to do things you seem to unroll differently?

The rest just apply fine, and 02- was needed here, 03- seemed an
unrolled dup, 04- in parts (stdint via sox.h, but overflow, sure),
it is too late to check the rest, 'will do tomorrow.
(I an maintaining an official contrib now private sox port for
CRUX Linux based upon 42b3557e13e0fe0 as of 20211029.)

Ciao!
