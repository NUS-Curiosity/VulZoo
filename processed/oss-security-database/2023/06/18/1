Subject: CVE-2023-35005: Apache Airflow: Information disclosure on
 configuration view 

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow 2.5.0 before 2.6.2

Description:

In Apache Airflow, some potentially sensitive values were being shown to the user in certain situations.








This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact configuration is not shown in the UI by default (only if `[webserver] expose_config` is set to `non-sensitive-only`), and not all uncensored values are actually sentitive.





This issue affects Apache Airflow: from 2.5.0 before 2.6.2.
