The CVE ecosystem hierarchy intends to solve this by having the CNAs do
this in the tree fashion.

FYI if you find incorrect NVD scores, you can contact <nvd at nist.gov>
with an engineering level argumentation why the score is not correct
and they will get back to you.

Of course this does not scale.

I contacted them however on this specific CVE now.


For CNA provided CVSS scores contact the CNA of course ( search in
https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners , all have email
links)

Ciao, Marcus
