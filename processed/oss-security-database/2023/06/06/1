Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2023-30575: Apache Guacamole: Incorrect calculation of
 Guacamole protocol element lengths

Severity: moderate
Base CVSS Score: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)

Affected versions:

- Apache Guacamole through 1.5.1

Description:

Apache Guacamole 1.5.1 and older may incorrectly calculate the lengths 
of instruction elements sent during the Guacamole protocol handshake, 
potentially allowing an attacker to inject Guacamole instructions during 
the handshake through specially-crafted data.

Mitigation:

Users of versions of Apache Guacamole 1.5.1 and older should upgrade to 
the 1.5.2 release.
