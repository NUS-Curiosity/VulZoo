the updated amd64-microcode only contains the fixes published to linux-firmware,
which only affects epyc cpus, as noted. unless you're running epyc cpus (which
is slightly unlikely so i thought i'd mention it, but apologies if that is
indeed the case) you didn't actually receive any fix.

the latest kernel released today sets the chicken bit if no patched ucode is
loaded which also works to mitigate the issue.
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=522b1d69219d8f083173819fde04f994aa051a98)

you can test this by running the zenbleed reproduction, from
https://cmpxchg8b.com/files/zenbleed-v5.tar.gz

(if it outputs anything, you're vulnerable)
