Subject: CVE-2023-49920: Apache Airflow: Missing CSRF protection on
 DAG/trigger 

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Airflow 2.7.0 before 2.8.0

Description:

Apache Airflow, version 2.7.0 through 2.7.3, has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to trigger a DAG in a GET request without CSRF validation.Â As a result, it was possible for a malicious website opened in the same browser - by the user who also had Airflow UI opened - to trigger the execution of DAGs without the user's consent.
Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or later which is not affected
