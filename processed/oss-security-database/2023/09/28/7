Subject: CVE-2023-41081: Apache Tomcat Connectors: Unexpected use of first
 declared worker in mod_jk for unmapped request [CORRECTION]

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache Tomcat Connectors 1.2.0 through 1.2.48

Description:

Important: Authentication Bypass CVE-2023-41081

The mod_jk component of Apache Tomcat Connectors in some circumstances, 
such as when a configuration included "JkOptions +ForwardDirectories" 
but the configuration did not       provide explicit mounts for all 
possible proxied requests, mod_jk would       use an implicit mapping 
and map the request to the first defined worker. Such an implicit 
mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the status worker 
and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As of JK 1.2.49, 
the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and all mappings 
must now be via explicit configuration. Only mod_jk is affected by this 
issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 
through 1.2.48.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.
