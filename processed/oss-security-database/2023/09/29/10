Subject: RE: Exim4 MTA CVEs assigned from ZDI

Hi,

The ZDI reached out multiple times to the developers regarding multiple bug reports with little progress to show for it. After our disclosure timeline was exceeded by many months, we notified the maintainer of our intent to publicly disclose these bugs, at which time we were told, "you do what you do." If these bugs have been appropriately addressed, we will update our advisories with a link to the security advisory, code check-in, or other public documentation closing the issue.

Thanks,
The ZDI

Hi,

Thank you for posting this, Heiko!  Also thank you Markus for bringing this up in the other thread:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/29/3

I've attached plain text exports of the ZDI advisories to this message for archival.

Out of the Exim Bugzilla entries in Markus' message, only
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3001 is currently open to the public, and it says:

Are distros allowed to make their updates public as soon as they can (presumably after requesting access to the protected repository)?

I suggest that you set a specific date/time e.g. in 2 days from now when both the Exim project will make the repo and the fixed bug entries (2999 and 3000) public _and_ distros will release updates.

Are you actively requesting such information from ZDI now?

This looks like sloppy handling of these issues so far by both ZDI and Exim - neither team pinging the other for 10 months, then Exim taking 4 months to fix even the 2 high-scored issues it did have sufficient info on.  What are you doing to improve the handling from this point on?

Thanks again,

Alexander
