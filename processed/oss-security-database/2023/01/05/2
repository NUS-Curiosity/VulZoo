No.  Failure to do this is a major cause of security problems in
Microsoft Windows.

No, it should not.

Yes, and there needs to be a database of such types.

I agree.

I agree.

I agree.

I agree.

Not sure what you mean by “accept”.  Do you mean that download should be
aborted?

> * File type spoofing by corrupting the Firefox and Thunderbird
>   handlers.json database.

I agree.

Qubes OS should probably register a catchall handler for special MIME
types that does nothing.
