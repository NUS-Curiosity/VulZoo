Subject: Re: CVE-2023-5631: XSS vulnerability in Roundcube
 webmail

Versions up to 1.6.3 - not 1.6.4 - are vulnerable.

https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5631

Roundcube before 1.4.15, 1.5.x before 1.5.5, and 1.6.x before 1.6.4 allows stored XSS via an HTML e-mail message with a crafted SVG document because of program/lib/Roundcube/rcube_washtml.php behavior. This could allow a remote attacker to load arbitrary JavaScript code.
