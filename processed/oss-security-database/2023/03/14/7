The original fix for this issue would cause a regression. After applying
it, sox would be unable to decode WAV GSM files. This has been reported
as https://bugs.debian.org/1032082. I am attaching an updated patch that
fixes this regression. It is meant to replace the previous patch. The
updated patch includes a regression test case to avoid repeating the
mistake.

I see that most distributions (e.g. RedHat, SUSE, Gentoo, etc.) have not
picked up the faulty patch. Ubuntu inherited it from Debian and will
likely inherit the fix as it gets fixed in Debian releases.
