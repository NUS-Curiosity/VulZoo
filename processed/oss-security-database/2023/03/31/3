Subject: CVE-2023-26269: Apache James server: Privilege escalation through
 unauthenticated JMX 

Severity: moderate

Description:

Apache James server version 3.7.3 and earlier provides a JMX management service without authentication by default. This allows privilege escalation by a 
malicious local user.

Work Arounds:

Note that version 3.7.4 onward will set up a JMX password automatically for Guice users.
