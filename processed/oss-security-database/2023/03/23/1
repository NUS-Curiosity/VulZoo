Subject: [CVE-2023-28686] Insufficient message sender validation in Dino

### Affected software

Dino (Instant Messenger) - https://dino.im/

### Severity

Medium (5.3): AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

### Affected versions
- Release version 0.4.0 and 0.4.1
- Release version 0.3.0 and 0.3.1
- Release version 0.2.2 and earlier
- Nightly version 0.4.1-13-g6690d8e4 and earlier

### Fixed versions
- Release version 0.4.2
- Release version 0.3.2
- Release version 0.2.3
- Nightly version 0.4.1-14-gef8fb0e9

### Description

It was discovered that when a Dino client receives a specifically
crafted message from an unauthorized sender, it would use information
from that message to add, update or remove entries in the user's
personal bookmark store without requiring further user interaction.

This vulnerability allows the attacker to change how group chats are
displayed or to force a user to join or leave an attacker-selected
groupchat. This can be used to trick the user to reveal sensitive
information to the attacker.

### Advice

All deployments should upgrade to a fixed version or apply the patch
from commit ef8fb0e94ce79d5fde2943e433ad0422eb7f70ec.
