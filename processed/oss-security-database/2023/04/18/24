In that case even the FreeBSD rights(4) (capsicum(4)) manual entry

   CAP_IOCTL    Permit ioctl(2).  Be aware that this system call has
                enormous scope, including potentially global scope
                for some objects.  The list of permitted ioctl
                commands can be further limited with the
                cap_ioctls_limit(2) system call.

is teethless.
