I've been trying to push towards getting old-PCRE out of Debian; you can 
track the outstanding bugs online[0], and there's similar for Ubuntu[1].

Once the next Debian release "bookworm" is out, I'm hoping to be able to 
make the outstanding bugs release critical, moving towards not shipping 
the older pcre (called pcre3 in Debian for Historical Reasons) in the 
next release...
