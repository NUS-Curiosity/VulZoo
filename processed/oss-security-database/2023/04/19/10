Are there any plans to disclose any proofs of concept to test these
issues? From the distro side these are not only useful to check which
ncurses snapshots we need to fix, but also for our QA teams to test the
update and detect regressions.

For example, we are not sure if the build option
`--disable-root-environ` does anything to mitigate the issues.

For what is worth, we have not been contacted, as far as I can tell.
