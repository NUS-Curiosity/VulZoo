having a patch that is possible to apply to ncurses would make this possible,
since otherwise it's not possible to patch anything without just updating to the
latest ncurses snapshot.

that said,

- ncurses doesn't keep any git (or whatever) history anywhere (to my knowledge),
  so i don't know where this would even come from

- as someone that uses the latest snapshots, 20230401 works, but 20230408 breaks
  some applications like tmux (when clicking with the mouse, it just exits). i
  assume this breakage is caused by these fixes in question, but i didn't debug
  it further.
