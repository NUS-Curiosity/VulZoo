Subject: CVE-2020-13791 QEMU: ati-vga: OOB access while reading PCI configuration
 may lead to DoS

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the ati-vga emulator of the QEMU. 
It could occur while reading PCI configuration bytes via ati_mm_read routine, 
if the address sent by a guest is towards an end of the PCI configuration 
space. A guest user/process may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process 
resulting in DoS scenario.
