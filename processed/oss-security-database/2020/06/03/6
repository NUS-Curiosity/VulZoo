Subject: CVE-2020-13765 QEMU: loader: OOB access while loading registered
 ROM may lead to code execution

   Hello,

An out-of-bound write access flaw was found in the way QEMU loads ROM contents 
at boot time. This flaw occurs in the rom_copy() routine while loading the 
contents of a 32-bit -kernel image into memory. Running an untrusted -kernel 
image may load contents at arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to 
code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.
