CVE-2020-11969: Apache TomEE - useJMX attribute on ActiveMQ resource
adapter URI causes authenticated JMX port to be open

Severity: High

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache TomEE 8.0.0-M1 - 8.0.1
Apache TomEE 7.1.0 - 7.1.2
Apache TomEE 7.0.0-M1 - 7.0.7
Apache TomEE 1.0.0 - 1.7.5

Description:
If Apache TomEE is configured to use the embedded ActiveMQ broker, and the
broker URI includes the useJMX=true parameter, a JMX port is opened on TCP
port 1099, which does not include authentication.

Mitigation:
- Upgrade to TomEE 7.0.8 or later
- Upgrade to TomEE 7.1.3 or later
- Upgrade to TomEE 8.0.2 or later

Alternatively, users may wish to remove the useJMX option from the URI (the
default is false).
