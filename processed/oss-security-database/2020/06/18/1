Subject: CVE-2020-10781 kernel: zram sysfs resource consumption

Gday,

A user with a local account and the ability to read the
/sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file which on each read will create a
zram device node in the /dev/ directory.  This allocates kernel memory
and is not allocated to a user.

Continually reading this file may consume a large amount of system
memory and cause the system OOM killer to activate, terminating
userspace processes possibly making the system inoperable.
