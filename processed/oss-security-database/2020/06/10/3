I am in discussions with Anthony Steinhauser from Google, Anthony
stated there were no CVE's assigned.  This message was mainly for the
other CNA's  ( https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html ) who may be
able to assign CVE's.

If the kernel was a CVE Numbering Authority, they could assign their
own ( https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html#become_a_cna ) and this whole
problem would not exist.  I'm not on the security@...nel.org mailing
list (even after asking), so I can't really say what goes on behind
those closed doors, I would think it falls under their interests.

No problem.
