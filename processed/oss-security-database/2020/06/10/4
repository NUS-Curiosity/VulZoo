Is oss-security the place to sync up on those things?  I thought you all
had your own list to sync on those things, as that must happen often.

The kernel does NOT want to become a CVE Numbering Authority, and our
documentation explicitly states that if you want a CVE for a kernel
issue, you can just go ask MITRE or someone else for it:
	https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/security-bugs.html

There's loads of reasons why CVEs don't really work for the kernel at
all, as has been discussed many times here on this list, and in other
places, and even with MITRE themselves (and they agree with me).

I don't think we want to rehash that again here :)
