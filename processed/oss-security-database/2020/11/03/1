Subject: CVE-2020-27152 Kernel: KVM: host stack overflow via loop due to lazy
 update IOAPIC

   Hello,

A stack overflow via an infinite loop condition issue was found in the KVM 
hypervisor of the Linux kernel. It could occur while processing interrupts 
because irq state is erroneously set. A guest user may use this flaw to crash 
the host kernel resulting in DoS scenario.
