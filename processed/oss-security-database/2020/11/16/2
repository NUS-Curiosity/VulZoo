I think this is key. If you find a vulnerability, you typically need to ensure that it gets
a CVE assigned if you want coordination & resolution to happen. It's how coordination happens.
There are issues with CVEs, but I’ve never seen a CVE assignment
get dropped in recent years once it was requested properly.
Delayed, yes, but I know CVE assignments don’t take 3 years :-).
And yes, there are special issues with the Linux kernel, but this package isn’t the Linux kernel.

If you think that CVE assignment is still of “fluctuating reliability” I’d like to hear that argument
and get it fixed. It’s normally better to fix the standard process for doing something than
to create yet another process that runs in parallel. I’ve seen no recent evidence of this reliability issue.

Sing this (to “Single Ladies”):
"If you like it, then you shoulda put a CVE on it...:"
