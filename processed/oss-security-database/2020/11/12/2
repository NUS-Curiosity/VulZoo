Subject: CVE-2020-13954: Apache CXF Reflected XSS in the services listing page
 via the styleSheetPath

Description:

By default, Apache CXF creates a /services page containing a listing of the
available endpoint names and addresses. This webpage is vulnerable to a
reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack via the styleSheetPath, which
allows a malicious actor to inject javascript into the web page.

This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.4.1 and
3.3.8.

Please note that this is a separate issue to CVE-2019-17573.

Workaround:

Users of Apache CXF should update to either 3.3.8 or 3.4.1. Alternatively,
it is possible to disable the service listing altogether by setting the
"hide-service-list-page" servlet parameter to "true".
