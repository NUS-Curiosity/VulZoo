Subject: CVE-2014-4508

Hello,

This is an old CVE but it was recently "rediscovered" [1].

CVE-2014-4508 is a memory leak in the auditing subsystem in the kernel.  On old 32 bit linux kernels that don't have [2] this memory leak turns out to be quite bad: you can trigger an out of memory condition that the system cannot recover from not matter how hard it tries.

If you believe you have such a kernel, please get in touch with me directly.
