Subject: [CVE-2020-26521][CVE-2020-26892] NATS JWT vulnerabilities

Folks,

The NATS project has a new advisories website:
  <https://advisories.nats.io/>

We also have two new CVEs; both relate to our JWT handling and both
affect the NATS server:

* CVE-2020-26521
  + Nil deref in JWT library, causing Go panic
  + NATS server upgrade required to avoid Denial-of-Service
  + 2020-11-02
* CVE-2020-26892
  + Incorrect credential expiration handling via JWT library
  + API fixes needed by library users
  + NATS server upgrade required for expiration to work
  + 2020-11-02

The text of our advisories should be attached.

We have just released NATS server 2.1.9 which includes the fixes for
both these issues.

Regards,
-Phil Pennock
