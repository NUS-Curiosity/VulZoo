Subject: CVE-2020-13362 QEMU: megasas: OOB read access due to invalid index
 leads to DoS

   Hello,

An OOB read access issue was found in the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 emulator of the 
QEMU. It occurs in 'megasas_lookup_frame' routine when 's->reply_queue_head' 
is set to a malicious value. A guest user/process may use this flaw to crash 
the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.
