Subject: CVE-2020-12888 Kernel: vfio: access to disabled MMIO space of some
 devices may lead to DoS scenario

   Hello,

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel, where it allows userspace processes, for 
example, a guest VM, to directly access h/w devices via its VFIO driver 
modules. The VFIO modules allow users to enable or disable access to the 
devices' MMIO memory address spaces. If a user attempts to access (read/write) 
the devices' MMIO address space when it is disabled, some h/w devices issue an 
interrupt to the CPU to indicate a fatal error condition, crashing the system. 
This flaw allows a guest user or process to crash the host system resulting in 
a denial of service.
