Subject: [CVE-2018-1285] XXE vulnerability in Apache log4net

Summary: Apache log4net does not disable XML external entities when
parsing log4net configuration files. This could allow for XXE-based
attacks in applications that accept arbitrary configuration files from
users. [1]

Affected: log4net up to 2.0.8

Mitigation: as there are no further releases of log4net beyond 2.0.8,
and the Logging Services PMC has voted [2] to mark the project
dormant, users should not allow arbitrary configuration files to be
specified from untrusted sources. While this is arguably a
vulnerability, misuse of any framework allowing untrusted input to
configure things is always a bad idea.
