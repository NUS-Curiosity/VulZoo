Subject: CVE-2019-20382 QEMU: vnc: memory leakage upon disconnect

   Hello,

A memory leakage flaw was found in the way VNC display driver of QEMU handled 
connection disconnect, when ZRLE, Tight encoding is enabled. It creates two 
vncState objects, one of which allocates memory for Zlib's data object. This 
allocated memory is not free'd upon disconnection resulting in the said memory 
leakage issue.

A user able to connect to the VNC server could use this flaw to leak host 
memory leading to a potential DoS scenario.

Upstream patch:
