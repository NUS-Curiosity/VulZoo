Subject: [CVE-2019-10091] Apache Geode SSL endpoint verification vulnerability

CVE-2019-10091 Apache Geode SSL endpoint verification vulnerability

Severity: Medium

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Geode 1.9.0

Description:
When TLS is enabled with ssl-endpoint-identification-enabled set to
true, Apache Geode fails to perform hostname verification of the
entries in the certificate SAN during the SSL handshake.  This could
compromise intra-cluster communication using a man-in-the-middle
attack.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.9.1,
1.10.0, or later.

Credit:
This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Geode Security Team
by Sai Boorlagadda from Pivotal.
