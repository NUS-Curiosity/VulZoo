It was a "pre-notification about a security advisory about to ship next week in sync with our next curl release", for CVE-2020-8177. On curl's git tree, that very bug did been fixed and released in 20200621:

Once again, I think CVE-2020-8177 is more of an exception than the rule.
I would be more interested in comments by "CVE experts" on whether the
task Xiao proposes and volunteers for is in general worthwhile or not,
and why.  Would similar "notify a vulnerability publication" reminders
be desirable for issues that got the CVE IDs from one of the CNAs on the
distros list?
