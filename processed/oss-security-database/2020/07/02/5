Xiao -
  this delay may be possible due to many things, but the simplest
possibility that comes to mind is that Daniel (here cc'd) from H1 has only
gotten a reservation of CVE number, and he and MITRE have not triggered the
submission yet.

The classic turnaround with MITRE submissions (via the webform) is less
than 48h from my experience, so when we're seeing weeks of delays, it
typically means MITRE has not been told to publish it yet.


Hope that helps,
