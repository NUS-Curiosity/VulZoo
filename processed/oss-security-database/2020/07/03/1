Subject: Re: Contributing Back

I haven't remind MITRE before. While they have an interface to make it:

https://cve.mitre.org/about/contactus.html

See the forth topic called "*To notify us about a vulnerability
publication*". I just remind them about CVE-2020-8169 and  CVE-2020-8177
with it. Hope it works. :-)


I will check the status of them on CVE/NVD website these days.


Thanks

Xiao
