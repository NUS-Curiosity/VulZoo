 guest-triggered excessive memory usage

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-29487 / XSA-354
                               version 4

             XAPI: guest-triggered excessive memory usage

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Certain xenstore keys provide feedback from the guest, and are therefore
watched by toolstack.  Specifically, keys are watched by xenopsd, and
data are forward via RPC through message-switch to xapi.

The watching logic in xenopsd sends one RPC update containing all data,
any time any single xenstore key is updated, and therefore has O(N^2)
time complexity.  Furthermore, message-switch retains recent (currently
128) RPC messages for diagnostic purposes, yielding O(M*N) space
complexity.

The quantity of memory a single guest can monopolise is bounded by
xenstored quota, but the quota is fairly large.  It is believed to be in
excess of 1G per malicious guest.

In practice this manifests as a host denial of service, either through
message-switch thrashing against swap, or OOM'ing entirely, depending on
dom0's configuration.

This series introduces quotas in xenopsd to limit the quantity of keys
which result in RPC traffic.

IMPACT
======

A buggy or malicious guest can cause unreasonable memory usage in dom0,
resulting in a host denial of service.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of XAPI are vulnerable.

Systems which are not using the XAPI toolstack are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations available.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Edwin Török of Citrix.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
