Subject: CVE-2020-25641 kernel: soft lockup when submitting zero length bvecs.

Gday,

A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of biovec usage.  A
zero-length biovec request issued to the block subsystem could cause the
kernel to enter an infinite loop causing a denial of service. An attacker
with a local account can issue requests to a block device can cause a
denial of service.

This has been assigned CVE-2020-25641,

According to the fix commits "Introduced in":
# git tag --contains 1bdc76aea115 | head -n 1
v4.10

Fixed by:

Thank you.
