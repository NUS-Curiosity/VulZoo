            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-25599 / XSA-343
                               version 4

                       races with evtchn_reset()

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Fix build of backports of patch 3.  Adjust affect versions.

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Uses of EVTCHNOP_reset (potentially by a guest on itself) or
XEN_DOMCTL_soft_reset (by itself covered by XSA-77) can lead to the
violation of various internal assumptions.  This may lead to out of
bounds memory accesses or triggering of bug checks.

IMPACT
======

In particular x86 PV guests may be able to elevate their privilege to
that of the host.  Host and guest crashes are also possible, leading to
a Denial of Service (DoS).  Information leaks cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions from 4.5 onwards are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.4 and
earlier are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation.

CREDITS
=======

Different aspects of this issue were discovered by Julien Grall of
Amazon and by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
