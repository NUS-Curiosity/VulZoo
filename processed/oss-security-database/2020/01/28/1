Subject: CVE-2020-1940: Apache Jackrabbit Oak sensitive information disclosure
 vulnerability

CVE-2020-1940:
Apache Jackrabbit Oak sensitive information disclosure vulnerability

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Jackrabbit Oak (org.apache.jackrabbit.oak-core) 1.2.0 to 1.22.0

Description:
The optional initial password change and password expiration features [1] are prone to a
sensitive information disclosure vulnerability. The code mandates the changed password to
be passed as an additional attribute to the credentials object but does not remove it upon
processing during the first phase of the authentication. In combination with additional,
independent authentication mechanisms, this may lead to the new password being disclosed.

Mitigation:
1.12.0 - 1.22.0 should be upgraded to 1.24.0
1.10.x should be upgraded to 1.10.8
For older maintained and affected branches (1.2.x, 1.4.x, 1.6.x, 1.8.x) please find patches attached.

The issue was reported by Andrew Khoury and Russ Wright of Adobe.
