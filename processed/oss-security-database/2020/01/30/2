Subject: [CVE-2020-1931] Apache SpamAssassin Nefarious rule configuration
 (.cf) files can be configured to run system commands with warnings.

Apache SpamAssassin 3.4.4 was recently released [1], and fixes an issue
of security note where nefarious rule configuration (.cf) files can be
configured to run system commands similar to CVE-2018-11805.  This issue
is less stealthy and attempts to exploit the issue will throw warnings. 
Thanks to Damian Lukowski at credativ for reporting the issue
ethically.  With this bug unpatched, exploits can be injected in a
number of scenarios though doing so remotely is difficult.  In addition
to upgrading to SA 3.4.4, we again recommend that users should only use
update channels or 3rd party .cf files from trusted places.

This issue has been assigned CVE id CVE-2020-1931 [2]
