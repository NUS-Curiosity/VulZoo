Subject: CVE-2020-7211 QEMU: Slirp: potential directory traversal using
 relative paths via tftp server on Windows host

   Hello,

A potential directory traversal issue was found in the tftp server of the 
SLiRP user-mode networking implementation used by QEMU. It could occur on 
Windows host, as it allows to use both forward ('/') and backward slash('\') 
tokens as separators in a file path.

A user able to access the tftp server could use this flaw to access undue 
files by using relative paths.

Upstream patch:
