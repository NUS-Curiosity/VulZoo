CVE-2020-1925: Possible SSRF in AsyncResponseWrapperImpl

Severity: Important
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Olingo 4.0.0 to 4.7.0
The OData v2 versions of Olingo 2.x are not affected

Description:
The AsyncRequestWrapperImpl class reads a URL from the Location
header, and then sends a GET or DELETE request to this URL. It may
allow to implement a SSRF attack. If an attacker tricks a client to
connect to a malicious server, the server can make the client call any
URL including internal resources which are not directly accessible by
the attacker.

Mitigation:
4.x.x users should upgrade to 4.7.1
