Could you please explain yourself why you think this is not a
vulnerability?  Even wanted functuality can constitute a vulnerability
if looked on closer.

The software allows to send pre-defined requests to arbitrary targets
and extract at least parts of the response.  This is a typical SSRF.
Would you require to specify the allowed targets, noone would ask.

Please don't.  You just accused the reporter of malpractice on a public
forum.  JFYI, this is punishable in your jurisdiction.

Also embargo and posting a public issue on GitHub don't really mix.

You did not address the reporter at all.  The reporter is also not a
regular user of GitHub, where this issue was raised.

As others already told you, Mitre provides a form to request updates to
CVE entries at https://cve.mitre.org/cve/update_cve_entries.html.
