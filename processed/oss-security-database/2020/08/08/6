I would suggest reaching MITRE:
https://cve.mitre.org/cve/update_cve_entries.html
- "Request an update to an exiting CVE entry"
- Type: "Rejection"

They'll either do the update or point you to the assigning CNA.

Most likely they'll mark the issue as "DISPUTED" within a few business days.

Cheers!
Sylvain
