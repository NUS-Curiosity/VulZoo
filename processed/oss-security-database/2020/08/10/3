I see your point. Our general assumption is to *not* consider assert()
failures CVE worthy if they can only be triggered by privileged users
[1]. In this case specifically, given the assertion failure occurs
while sending packets from the guest, we assumed it may be possible
for an unprivileged guest user to cause a DoS scenario (e.g., by
sending malicious/malformed network packets). In accordance with QEMU
maintainers, we therefore decided to provide a fix for this bug. But
again, I agree these kinds of issues tend to be questionable, so we
typically proceed on a case-by-case basis.
