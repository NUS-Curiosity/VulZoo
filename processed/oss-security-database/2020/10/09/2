Subject: [CVE-2020-13955] Apache Calcite Disabled HTTPS Hostname Verification

Severity: Moderate

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Calcite 0.8 to 1.25

Description:
HttpUtils#getURLConnection method disables explicitly hostname verification
for HTTPS connections making clients vulnerable to man-in-the-middle
attacks.
Calcite uses internally this method to connect with Druid and Splunk so
information leakage may happen when using the respective Calcite adapters.

The method itself is in a utility class so people may use it to create
vulnerable
HTTPS connections for other applications.

>From Apache Calcite 1.26 onwards, the hostname verification will be
performed using the default JVM truststore.

Mitigation:
Users should upgrade to 1.26 if:
they are using Druid or Splunk adapters via HTTPS;
they are using HttpUtils directly for HTTPS connections.
