Subject: CVE-2020-15999 fixed in FreeType 2.10.4

Before making this release, Werner said:

> I've just fixed a heap buffer overflow that can happen for some
> malformed `.ttf` files with PNG sbit glyphs.  It seems that this
> vulnerability gets already actively used in the wild, so I ask all
> users to apply the corresponding commit as soon as possible.

But distros should be warned that 2.10.3 and later may break the build
of ghostscript, due to ghostscript's use of a withdrawn macro that
wasn't intended for external usage:

Ghostscript's fix for that is at:

FreeType 2  is a software  font engine that  is designed to  be small,
efficient,  highly   customizable,  and  portable   while  capable  of
producing high-quality output (glyph images) of most vector and bitmap
font formats.

Note that  FreeType 2 is  a font service  and doesn't provide  APIs to
perform higher-level features, like text layout or graphics processing
(e.g.,  colored  text  rendering,  `hollowing',  etc.).   However,  it
greatly simplifies these tasks by providing a simple, easy to use, and
uniform interface to access the content of font files.

FreeType  2  is  released  under  two open-source  licenses:  our  own
BSD-like FreeType  License and the  GPL.  It can  thus be used  by any
kind of projects, be they proprietary or not.
