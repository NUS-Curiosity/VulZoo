    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12521
__________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 Due to incorrect buffer handling Squid is vulnerable to cache
 poisoning, remote execution, and denial of service attacks when
 processing ESI responses.

__________________________________________________________________

Severity:

 These problems allow a remote server delivering certain ESI
 response syntax to trigger a buffer overflow.

 On systems with heap overflow protection overflow will shutdown
 the proxy causing a denial of service for all clients accessing
 the Squid service.

 On systems with ESI buffer pooling (the default) overflow will
 truncate portions of generated payloads. Poisoning the HTTP
 response cache with corrupted objects.

 The CVE-2019-12519 issue also overwrites arbitrary attacker
 controlled information onto the process stack. Allowing remote
 code execution with certain crafted ESI payloads.

 These problems are restricted to ESI responses received from an
 upstream server. Attackers have to compromise the server or
 transmission channel to utilize these vulnerabilities.

 If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
 to the package vendor for availability information on updated
 packages.

__________________________________________________________________

Determining if your version is vulnerable:

 All Squid-2.x are not vulnerable.

 All Squid built with --disable-esi are not vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.0 versions built without --enable-esi are not
 vulnerable.

 All Squid-3.x versions built with --enable-esi are vulnerable.

 All Squid-4.x up to and including Squid-4.10 are vulnerable.

 Squid-5.0.1 is not vulnerable to the CVE-2019-12519 remote code
 execution issue.

 Squid-5.0.1 is vulnerable to the CVE-2019-12521 issues.

__________________________________________________________________

Workaround:

 Build Squid with --disable-esi
