Subject: Re: spoofing of local email sender via a homoglyph
 attack

I am not sure that the "from" header applies to user probing, as the 
actual mail server configuration on which I'm testing would accept any 
user as a sender:

# nc -v *** OMITTED *** 25
Connection to *** OMITTED *** 25 port [tcp/smtp] succeeded!
220 *** OMITTED *** ESMTP Postfix
mail from: userdoesnotexists@...get.com
250 2.1.0 Ok
rcpt to: test@...get.com
550 5.1.1 <test@...get.com>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in 
local recipient table
rcpt to: j??hn.doe@...get.com
550 5.1.1 <j??hn.doe@...get.com>: Recipient address rejected: User 
unknown in local recipient table
rcpt to: existing.user@...get.com
250 2.1.5 Ok

However, a non-existing user would not be accepted in the "rcpt-to" 
header, so this is another possible vector. This was discovered while 
doing a black box test on one of our clients, and it should be noted 
that the VRFY command has been enabled on the server, hence there was no 
reason to look for another way. However I'm unaware whether disabling 
VRFY would alter this behaviour. As you can see, the reported issue 
itself is may be actually due to the possibility of relaying a local 
email from a non-existing user.

Having said this, if not then I assume then you are correct, in case we 
take the "to" header into consideration in relation to user probing, 
unless I'm missing your logic.
