Since Ubuntu took over quite a few tasks (thanks!), I can suggest the
following tasks for Microsoft:

As primary, administrative: "4. Evaluate relevance to other parties such
as the upstream, other affected distros (not present on the (sub-)list),
and other Open Source projects, ...".

As backup, administrative: "3. Evaluate if the issue (or one of the
issues) is effectively already public ...".

I can also offer to act as a liason between linux-distros and
security@k.o now, and MSRC in the future.
