SECURITY-1453 / CVE-2019-10383
Jenkins did not properly escape the update site URL in some status 
messages shown in the update center, resulting in a stored cross-site 
scripting vulnerability that is exploitable by administrators and affects 
other administrators.


SECURITY-1491 / CVE-2019-10384
Jenkins allowed the creation of CSRF tokens without a corresponding web 
session ID. This is the result of an incomplete fix for SECURITY-626 in 
the 2019-07-17 security advisory. This allowed attackers able to obtain a 
CSRF token without associated session ID to implement CSRF attacks with 
the following constraints:

* The token had to be created for the anonymous user (and could only be 
  used for actions the anonymous user can perform)
* The victimâ€™s IP address needed to remain unchanged (unless the proxy 
  compatibility option was enabled)
* The victim must not have a valid web session at the time of the attack


SECURITY-1294 / CVE-2019-10390
Splunk Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-
submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to 
sandbox protection. This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to 
execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master by applying AST transforming 
annotations such as @Grab to source code elements.


SECURITY-1512 / CVE-2019-10391
IBM Application Security on Cloud Plugin stores service passwords in job
configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in 
plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in 
exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting 
vulnerabilities, and similar situations.
