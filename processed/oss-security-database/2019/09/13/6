Subject: CVE-2019-10071: Apache Tapestry vulnerability disclosure

CVE-2019-0207: Apache Tapestry 5.4.2 Path Traversal vulnerability
Severity: important
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions affected: all Apache Tapestry versions between 5.4.0, including
its betas, and 5.4.3.

Description: The code which checks HMAC in form submissions used
String.equals() for comparisons, which results in a timing side channel for
the comparison of the HMAC signatures. This could lead to remote code
execution if an attacker is able to determine the correct signature for
their payload. The comparison should be done with a constant time algorithm
instead.

Mitigation:
Upgrade to Tapestry 5.4.5, which is a drop-in replacement for any 5.4.x
version.
