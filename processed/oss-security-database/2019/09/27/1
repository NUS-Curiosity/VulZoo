This seems like it might be a duplicate of CVE-2019-15098. The fix for
CVE-2019-15098 was recently merged upstream:

 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=39d170b3cb62ba98567f5c4f40c27b5864b304e5

If you agree, could you request that MITRE mark CVE-2019-15290 as a
duplicate of CVE-2019-15098?
