Subject: CVE-2019-15890 QEMU: Slirp: use-after-free during packet reassembly

   Hello,

A use-after-free issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of the 
QEMU emulator. It occurs in ip_reass() routine while reassembling incoming 
packets, if the first fragment is bigger than the m->m_dat[] buffer. A 
user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on the host 
resulting in DoS.
