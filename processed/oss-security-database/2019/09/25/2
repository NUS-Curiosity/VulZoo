## Impact ##

By exploiting the documented vulnerability, an attacker can execute
JavaScript code in a victim's browser within the origin of the target
site. This can be misused, for example, by taking over future administrative
web management sessions.

## Vulnerability Description ##

Several parameters of the file `/inc/class-easyfancybox.php` are affected by
stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. The file is a part of the
Settings > Media admin page of the WordPress instance.

These setting parameters are embedded in CSS blocks without encoding or
sanitization, that are sent to the client's browser. The style sheet is sent
along with every publicly accessible page, no matter if the plugin is needed
on some pages or not.

For example, the following parameters are vulnerable:

* `/inc/class-easyfancybox.php`
  * fancybox_titleColor
  * fancybox_paddingColor

There are many more vulnerable parameters, the above listed are given only as
an example.

The vulnerabilities are located in `/inc/class-easyfancybox.php`:

```php
[...]
		if ( !empty($paddingColor) )
			$content_style .= 'border-color:'.$paddingColor.';';
[...]
		if ( !empty($titleColor) )
			$styles .= '#fancybox-title,#fancybox-title-float-main{color:'.$titleColor.'}';
[...]
```

As the above code snippet shows, the parameters `$paddingColor` and
`$titleColor` contains user input and is concatenated into `$content_style`
or respectively `$styles` without performing any sanitization or escaping.

## Proof of Concept ##

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by, firstly having access to the
`Settings > Media page` within the administrative portal and secondly setting
as `$titleColor` the following string:


```text
#44}</style><img src="" onerror="alert(1)">
```

This leads to the following HTML response (shortened for readability):

```html
<style id='fancybox-inline-css' type='text/css'>
#fancybox-title,#fancybox-title-float-main{color:#44}</style><img src="" onerror="alert(1)">}
</style>
```

## Recommended Countermeasures ##

We recommend strictly whitelisting the user input before it is being used. The only allowed characters should be alphanumeric characters and the hash sign.

## Timeline ##

* `2019-09-11` Identified the vulnerability in version 1.8.17
* `2019-09-11` Contacted the vendor via support
* `2019-09-16` Vendor closed the vulnerability in version 1.8.18
* `2019-09-23` Publication of CVE-2019-16524
