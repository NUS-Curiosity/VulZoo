Subject: [CVE-2019-0231] MINA SSLFilter security Issue

Description: Handling of the close_notify SSL/TLS message does not
lead to a connection closure, leading the server to retain the socket
opened and to have the client potentially receive clear-text messages
which were supposed to be encrypted.

This security issue is fixed by Apache MINA 2.0.21 or Apache MINA
2.0.21. Please migrate to those new versions.
