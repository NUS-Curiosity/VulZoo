Subject: Re: CVE-2019-10149: Exim 4.87 to 4.91: possible
 remote exploit

The fix for CVE-2019-10149 is public now.

    https://git.exim.org/exim.git
    Branch exim-4_91+fixes.

Thank you to
    - Qualys for reporting it.
    - Jeremy for fixing it.
    - you for using Exim.

Sorry for confusion about the public release. We were forced to react,
as details leaked.

The patch should apply cleanly to all affected versions (4.87->4.91). We
do not do a security release, as the official Exim version is at 4.92
already and older releases are considered to be outdated and not
supported by the developers anymore.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need help backporting the
fix.
