Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Security regression in Kubernetes kubelet v1.13.6 and v1.14.2 only - CVE-2019-11245


Hello Kubernetes Community-


A security-related issue was discovered in kubelet versions v1.13.6 and v1.14.2. The issue is medium severity and can be mitigated with a pod spec configuration change OR by **downgrading** kubelets to v1.13.5 or v1.14.1.


**Vulnerability Details**


When a container runs for the first time on a node, it correctly respects the UID set by the container image (e.g. USER in a Dockerfile). However, on the second run, the container will run as UID 0 (aka root) which can be an undesired escalated privilege.


Pods that specify an explicit runAsUser are unaffected and continue to work properly.

PodSecurityPolicies that force a runAsUser setting are also unaffected and continue to work properly.

Pods that specify mustRunAsNonRoot:true will refuse to start the container as uid 0, which can affect availability.

This issue is filed as CVE-2019-11245. See https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/78308<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkubernetes%2Fkubernetes%2Fissues%2F78308&data=02%7C01%7Ctpepper%40vmware.com%7C4656abfd3c4d492bb60108d6e549d643%7Cb39138ca3cee4b4aa4d6cd83d9dd62f0%7C0%7C0%7C636948502634407306&sdata=miB3xe0VtlfnmX%2BsX7%2BfPSH3dtmPiNnFMGtTD9MMvuY%3D&reserved=0> for more details.


**Am I vulnerable?**


Run this to print out all nodes and their kubelet version:



kubectl get nodes -o=jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.status.nodeInfo.machineID}{"\t"}{.status.nodeInfo.kubeletVersion}{"\n"}{end}'


If the output lists Kubelet versions listed below you are running a vulnerable version:

  *
  *   v1.13.6
  *
  *
  *
  *   v1.14.2
  *


**How do I mitigate the vulnerability?**


There are two potential mitigations to this issue:


  *
  *   Downgrade to kubelet v1.13.5 or v1.14.1
  *   as instructed by your Kubernetes distribution.
  *
  *
  *   Set RunAsUser on all pods in the cluster
  *   that should not run as root. This is a Security Context feature; the docs are at
  *   https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkubernetes.io%2Fdocs%2Ftasks%2Fconfigure-pod-container%2Fsecurity-context%2F%23set-the-security-context-for-a-pod&data=02%7C01%7Ctpepper%40vmware.com%7C4656abfd3c4d492bb60108d6e549d643%7Cb39138ca3cee4b4aa4d6cd83d9dd62f0%7C0%7C0%7C636948502634407306&sdata=01A5f5Nzkf1dJVqJDvh4SZPA%2B%2FsF4MxYDQsJaifF5pA%3D&reserved=0>

**How do I upgrade?**


An upgrade addressing this issue is not yet available. But, will appear in v1.13.7 and v1.14.3 ASAP and will be announced here.


**Thank you**
