Subject: CVE-2019-10149: Exim 4.87 to 4.91: possible remote exploit

CVE-2019-10149 Exim 4.87 to 4.91
================================

We received a report of a possible remote exploit.  Currently there is no
evidenice of an active use of this exploit.

A patch exists already, is being tested, and backported to all
versions we released since (and including) 4.87.

The severity depends on your configuration.  It depends on how close to
the standard configuration your Exim runtime configuration is. The
closer the better.

Exim 4.92 is not vulnerable.

Next steps:

* t0:    Distros will get access to our non-public security Git repo
         (access is granted based on the SSH keys that are known to us)

* t0+7d: Coordinated Release Date: Distros should push the patched
         version to their repos. The Exim maintainers will publish
         the fixed source to the official and public Git repo.

t0    is expected to be 2019-06-04, 10:00 UTC
t0+7d is expected to be 2019-06-04, 10:00 UTC
