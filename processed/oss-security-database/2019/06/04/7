I guess I wasn't the only one wondering how revealing this is, so:

$ diff -urwx doc exim-4.91 exim-4.92 | diffstat -s
 131 files changed, 6898 insertions(+), 4395 deletions(-)
$ diff -urwx doc exim-4.91 exim-4.92 | wc
  27635  114347  935620

exim-4.92/doc/ChangeLog lists tens of changes.

Exim 4.92 appears to have been released in February, when the security
issue referred to here was not yet known as such, so this wasn't a
deliberate decision to release the fix publicly yet keep it unmentioned.

Keeping the issue in this semi-public state for 7 days feels weird to
me, but given the above it doesn't look too unrealistic that the issue
won't be rediscovered during this time period.  (The risk of leaks is
probably higher.)  It'd be curious if someone ends up discovering a
different and yet unknown security issue by reading that diff. ;-)
