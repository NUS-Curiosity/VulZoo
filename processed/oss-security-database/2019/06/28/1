"Some (most?) of the kernel [security] bugs that get fixed don't go
through" linux-distros as well.

I'm not entirely happy with the wording used there, which currently is:

---
Fixes for sensitive bugs, such as those that might lead to privilege
escalations, may need to be coordinated with the private
<linux-distros@...openwall.org> mailing list so that distribution vendors
are well prepared to issue a fixed kernel upon public disclosure of the
upstream fix. Distros will need some time to test the proposed patch and
will generally request at least a few days of embargo, and vendor update
publication prefers to happen Tuesday through Thursday. When appropriate,
the security team can assist with this coordination, or the reporter can
include linux-distros from the start. In this case, remember to prefix
the email Subject line with "[vs]" as described in the linux-distros wiki:
<http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#how-to-use-the-lists>
---

This says that "Distros [...] will generally request at least a few days
of embargo", but the actual policy of (linux-)distros is that the
reporter must provide a tentative public disclosure date/time in their
very first message.

Also, this doesn't say that by disclosing something to (linux-)distros
the reporter accepts the list's policy, and leaves actually reading that
wiki page with the policy optional.

I don't readily have suggested edits, but we should address these issues
somehow.  Please feel free to suggest edits.

On a related note, this might not be representative, but I ran a Twitter
poll on days of week for vulnerability disclosures:

https://twitter.com/solardiz/status/923885360001757185

Poll: What days of week work best for you for public disclosure by
others of vulnerabilities in software you (or your employer, etc.) use?

23% No preference or Other
33% Mon
36% Tue, Wed, Thu
 8% Fri, Sat, Sun

As you can see, Mon fared really well - almost same as Tue, Wed, Thu
combined, meaning that it might be _the_ preferred day of week for
vulnerability disclosures.  So we probably shouldn't exclude Mondays.

I'm not sure.  The microarchitectural "bugs" would have been
inappropriate to bring to the distros list earlier than in 14 days prior
to their public disclosures, and I don't know if the public disclosure
dates on those were specific enough to achieve that.  Maybe you know?

Thanks!  Ideally, you'd also demonstrate that Microsoft fixed those
issues (where relevant) within days of their public disclosure (so that
some days of advance notice would have made a difference).  Can you?

Or are you merely pointing out the kind of issues that would have been
relevant to you and presumably fixed promptly now, but were not relevant
and thus were not fixed back then?  That's less than ideal if so.

If Microsoft joins for its Linux offerings (including Linux on top of
Windows), then checking if the Linux issues also affect Windows (itself)
would involve sharing beyond the need-to-know condition of
(linux-)distros list policy, so isn't allowed by default.  It could
still be done with explicit approval of the reporter, though, and I
expect most people would give such approval if asked.
