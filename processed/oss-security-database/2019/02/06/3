Subject: [SECURITY ADVISORY] curl: SMTP end-of-response out-of-bounds read

SMTP end-of-response out-of-bounds read
=======================================

Project curl Security Advisory, February 6th 2019 -
[Permalink](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2019-3823.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

libcurl contains a heap out-of-bounds read in the code handling the
end-of-response for SMTP.

If the buffer passed to `smtp_endofresp()` isn't NUL terminated and contains
no character ending the parsed number, and `len` is set to 5, then the
`strtol()` call reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents will not
be returned to the caller.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

INFO
----

This bug was introduced in October 2013 in
[commit 2766262a68](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2766262a68).

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2019-3823 to this issue.

CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read

Severity: 3.7 (Low)

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: libcurl 7.34.0 to and including 7.63.0
- Not affected versions: libcurl < 7.34.0

THE SOLUTION

A [patch for CVE-2019-3823](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/39df4073e5413fcdbb5a38da0c1ce6f1c0ceb484) is available.

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
preference:

  A - Upgrade curl to version 7.64.0

  B - Apply the patch to your version and rebuild

  C - Turn off SMTP
