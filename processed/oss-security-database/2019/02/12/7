Severity: High

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Solr versions from 1.3 to 7.6.0

Description:
The "shards" parameter does not have a corresponding whitelist mechanism,
so it can request any URL.

Ensure your network settings are configured so that only trusted traffic is
allowed to ingress/egress your hosts running Solr.
