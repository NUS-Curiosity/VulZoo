Subject: CVE-2019-3812 - qemu - Out-of-bounds read in hw/i2c/i2c-ddc.c allows
 for memory disclosure

QEMU through version 2.10 through to 3.1.0 is vulnerable to an
out-of-bounds read of up to 128 bytes in the hw/i2c/i2c-ddc.c in the
function i2c_ddc() function. A local attacker with permission to
execute i2c commands could exploit this to read stack memory of the
qemu process on the host.

This was fixed upstream in commit 5b267840515730dbf6753495d5b7bd8b04ad1c

Systems without a monitor connected are affected, as are virtual
monitor is presented to virtual guests.  Systems with no graphics
cards attached to the virtual host are not affected.

This seems to be an information leak of stack contents which can be
used to defeat some kernel level protections and simplify further
attacks.
