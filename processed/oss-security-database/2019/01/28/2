Subject: CVE-2019-3813: spice: Off-by-one error in array access in spice/server/memslot.c

Hello,

spice versions 0.5.2 through 0.14.1 are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read
due to an off-by-one error in memslot_get_virt. This may lead to a
denial-of-service, or, in the worst case, code-execution by unauthenticated
attackers.

The attached patch fixes the issue in spice and is planned to be included
in forthcoming release spice 0.14.2.

This issue was reported by Christophe Fergeau (Red Hat).
