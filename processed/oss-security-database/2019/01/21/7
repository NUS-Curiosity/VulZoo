Subject: PowerDNS Security Advisories 2011-01 and 2019-02

Hi all,

We just released PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.9 fixing two security issues:

- PowerDNS Security Advisory 2019-01 (CVE-2019-3806): Lua hooks are not
called over TCP
- PowerDNS Security Advisory 2019-02 (CVE-2019-3807): DNSSEC validation
is not performed for AA=0 responses

These issues respectively affect PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.4 and 4.1.0,
up to and including 4.1.8. PowerDNS Recursor 4.0.x and below are not
affected.

The full security advisories are provided below, and can also be
found at:

PowerDNS Security Advisory 2019-01: Lua hooks are not applied in certain
configurations
========================================================================

-  CVE: CVE-2019-3806
-  Date: 21st of January 2019
-  Affects: PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.4 up to and including 4.1.8
-  Not affected: 4.0.x, 4.1.0 up to and including 4.1.3, 4.1.9
-  Severity: Low
-  Impact: Access restriction bypass
-  Exploit: This problem can be triggered via TCP queries
-  Risk of system compromise: No
-  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version
-  Workaround: Switch to pdns-distributes-queries=no

An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor where Lua hooks are not
properly applied to queries received over TCP in some specific
combination of settings, possibly bypassing security policies enforced
using Lua.

When the recursor is configured to run with more than one thread
(threads=X) and to do the distribution of incoming queries to the worker
threads itself (pdns-distributes-queries=yes), the Lua script is not
properly loaded in the thread handling incoming TCP queries, causing the
Lua hooks to not be properly applied.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2019-3806 by Red Hat.

PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.4 up to and including 4.1.8 is affected.


PowerDNS Security Advisory 2019-02: Insufficient validation of DNSSEC
signatures
=====================================================================

-  CVE: CVE-2019-3807
-  Date: 21st of January 2019
-  Affects: PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.0 up to and including 4.1.8
-  Not affected: 4.0.x, 4.1.9
-  Severity: Medium
-  Impact: Insufficient validation
-  Exploit: This problem can be triggered via crafted responses
-  Risk of system compromise: No
-  Solution: Upgrade to a non-affected version

An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor where records in the answer
section of responses received from authoritative servers with the AA
flag not set were not properly validated, allowing an attacker to bypass
DNSSEC validation.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2019-3807 by Red Hat.

PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.0 up to and including 4.1.8 is affected.

We would like to thank Ralph Dolmans and George Thessalonikefs of
NLNetLabs for finding and subsequently reporting this issue!
