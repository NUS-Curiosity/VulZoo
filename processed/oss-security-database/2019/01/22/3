CVE-2018-17199: mod_session_cookie does not respect expiry time

Severity: low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.37

Description:
In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.37 and prior, mod_session
checks the session expiry time before decoding the session.
This causes session expiry time to be ignored for
mod_session_cookie sessions since the expiry time is loaded
when the session is decoded.

Mitigation:
All httpd users deploying mod_session should upgrade to 2.4.38 or later.

Credit:
The issue was discovered by Diego Angulo from ImExHS.
