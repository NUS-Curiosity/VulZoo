Subject: Linux Kernel: Missing access_ok() checks in IOCTL function
 (gpu/drm/i915 Driver)

NOTE: I have requested a CVE identifier, and I'm sending this message, to
make tracking of the fix easier; however, to avoid missing security fixes
without CVE identifiers, you should *NOT* be cherry-picking a specific
patch in response to a notification about a kernel security bug.

Due to a lack of "access_ok()" checks in i915_gem_execbuffer2_ioctl[1], it
is possible to escalate privileges similar to the waitid vulnerability[2]

This is CVE-2018-20669
