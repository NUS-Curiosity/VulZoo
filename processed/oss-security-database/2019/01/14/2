I'm not sure that's correct. That happens to be the start of the
mainline git history, so all code older than that appears to have been
added by that commit.

Looking at the full history tree, I think I see the bug being introduced
in l2cap_get_conf_opt() here in May 2002 during the 2.5.x series:

  https://github.com/mpe/linux-fullhistory/commit/c38fab942f7ce71b30bfa71b3c75846ed6dc4846#diff-4d1b9a05ae99bd80285a75f4ded05abbL1519


Looking at l2cap_parse_conf_req(), the lack of error handling dates back
to the original submission, in v2.4.5.2 in May 2001:

  https://github.com/mpe/linux-fullhistory/commit/5857cb7a6e8112e1f3125ca2fe7f815e379ae2f3#diff-dd9f85cee1be8eba9aef4a6ee3ab099dR1436


There's instructions for using the fullhistory tree here:
