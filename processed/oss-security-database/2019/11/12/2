Subject: DPDK security advisory: CVE-2019-14818

A vulnerability was fixed in DPDK.

Some downstream stakeholders were warned in advance in order to coordinate the
release of fixes and reduce the vulnerability window.

A malicious container which has direct access to the vhost-user socket can keep
sending messages which may cause leaking resources until resulting a DOS.

All users of the vhost library are strongly encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.
