Subject: Nokogiri security update v1.10.5

Nokogiri v1.10.5 was released on 2019-10-31.

This is a security release.

Maintainers realized, after the release of v1.10.5, that it addresses CVEs
in upstream libxslt rated as "Priority: Medium" and "Priority: Low" by
Canonical, and "NVD Severity: Medium" by Debian. More details are available
below. More details are available below.

If you're using your distro's system libraries, rather than Nokogiri's
vendored libraries, there's no security need to upgrade at this time,
though you may want to check with your distro whether they've patched this
(Canonical has patched Ubuntu packages). Note that libxslt 1.1.34 addresses
these vulnerabilities.

Full details about the security update are available in Github Issue #1943 (
https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1943).

Affects: MRI users of Nokogiri's vendored libraries in Nokogiri <= v1.10.4

Advice: Upgrade to Nokogiri v1.10.5 or later
