Subject: CVE-2018-20815 QEMU: device_tree: heap buffer overflow while loading
 device tree blob

   Hello,

A heap buffer overflow issue was found in the load_device_tree() function of 
QEMU, which is invoked to load device tree blob at boot time. It occurs due to 
device tree size manipulation before buffer allocation, which could overflow a 
signed int type.

A user/process could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code on a 
host system with privileges of the QEMU process.

Upstream patch:
