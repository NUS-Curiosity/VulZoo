CVE-2018-11772: Apache VCL SQL injection attack in privilege management
 
Severity: Medium
 
Versions Affected: 2.1 through 2.5
 
Description: Apache VCL versions 2.1 through 2.5 do not properly validate 
cookie input when determining what node (if any) was previously selected in 
the privilege tree. The cookie data is then used in an SQL statement. This 
allows for an SQL injection attack. Access to this portion of a VCL system 
requires admin level rights.  Other layers of security seem to protect against 
malicious attack. However, all VCL systems running versions earlier than 2.5.1 
should be upgraded or patched. 
 
Mitigation: Upgrade to 2.5.1 or apply patches from https://vcl.apache.org/
security.html
 
Credit: This vulnerability was found and reported to the Apache VCL project by 
ADLab of Venustech.
