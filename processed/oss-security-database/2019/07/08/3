Subject: CVE-2019-13313, CVE-2019-13314: password disclosure via command line
 arguments

   Hello,

CVE-2019-13313
   Libosinfo: osinfo-install-script option leaks password via command line 
argument. 'osinfo-install-script' is used to generate a script for automated 
guest installations. It accepts user and admin passwords via command line 
arguments, thus leaking them via process listing.

CVE-2019-13314
   virt-bootstrap: allows local users to discover root password via process 
listing virt-bootstrap 1.1.0 allows local users to discover a root password 
via process listing, because it's passed as command line parameter via 
--root-password option.

These issues were reported by Fabiano FidÃªncio of Red Hat Inc.

Thank you.
