Subject: CVE-2019-13132: zeromq/libzmq: denial of service via stack overflow
 with arbitrary data

Hello,

A security vulnerability has been reported in libzmq/zeromq.

CVE-2019-13132: a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a
libzmq application, running with a socket listening with CURVE
encryption/authentication enabled, may cause a stack overflow and
overwrite the stack with arbitrary data, due to a buffer overflow in
the library. Users running public servers with the above configuration
are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible, as there are no
known mitigations. All versions from 4.0.0 and upwards are affected.

Thank you Fang-Pen Lin for finding the issue and reporting it!

The following upstream releases fixes the issue and will be shortly
available:

https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/tag/v4.3.2
https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq4-x/releases/tag/v4.0.9
https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq4-1/releases/tag/v4.1.7

Individual backported patches can be found on the upstream bug tracker,
and have been sent separately to the security teams of various
distributions:

https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/3558

The programs to reproduce the issue will be shared on the 15th of July.
