Exactly.  It's just an unusual disclosure process that involves giving
the users a heads-up a few days before public disclosure of the actual
vulnerabilities and fixes.  So far, this process is practiced by OpenSSL
and Exim (any others?)

Unfortunately, this keeps confusing people, which is why this time
Heiko's message starts with "Note: EMBARGO is still in effect".  Judging
by Mikhail's reply, this wasn't good enough to avoid confusion, and I
don't know what would be - maybe a paragraph of text acknowledging that
the disclosure process is unusual?  Somehow I didn't notice such
confusion in response to OpenSSL's pre-announcements (not here, but on
their own announce list), so maybe Exim should try to reuse OpenSSL's
wording.  Here's an example:
