Dongguangdong of Huawei PSIRT discovered and reported to linux-distros
on May 6 that this additionally affects flat binaries, binfmt_flat.c.

Since we're now past linux-distros' 14 days max embargo period and since
Dongguangdong failed to bring this in here on time, I felt I had to take
over and post the above now.

Personally, I find this a very minor detail, but I like (linux-)distros
policy to be adhered to without exceptions.
