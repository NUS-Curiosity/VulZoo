            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-17347 / XSA-293
                              version 4

                x86: PV kernel context switch corruption

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Correct affected versions statement.

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

On hardware supporting the fsgsbase feature, 64bit PV guests can set and
clear the applicable control bit in its virtualised %cr4, but the
feature remains fully active in hardware.  Therefore, the associated
instructions are actually usable.

Linux, which does not currently support this feature, has various
optimisations in its context switch path which justifiably assume that
userspace can't actually make changes without a system call.

Xen's behaviour of having this feature active behind the guest kernel's
back undermines the correctness of any context switch logic which
depends on the feature being disabled.

Userspace can therefore corrupt fsbase or gsbase (commonly used for
Thread Local Storage) in the next thread to be scheduled on the
current vcpu.

IMPACT
======

A malicious unprivileged guest userspace process can escalate its
privilege to that of other userspace processes in the same guest, and
potentially thereby to that of the guest operating system.

Additionally, some guest software which attempts to use this CPU
feature may trigger the bug accidentally, leading to crashes or
corruption of other processes in the same guest.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions 4.4 and later are vulnerable.  Xen 4.3 and earlier are not
vulnerable.

Only x86 hardware with the fsgsbase feature is vulnerable.  This is
believed to be Intel IvyBridge and later hardware, and AMD Steamroller
and later hardware.

ARM hardware is not affected.

Only 64bit PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.  32bit PV guests,
and HVM/PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability.

Whether the bug is exploitable, and whether it will be triggered by
accident, depend in a complicated way on the guest operating system
and its configuration.  Most guests are vulnerable to malicious
userspace processes.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only 32bit PV or HVM/PVH guests will avoid this vulnerability.

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
