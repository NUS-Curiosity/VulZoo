            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-17342 / XSA-287
                              version 3

         x86: steal_page violates page_struct access discipline

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Xen's reference counting rules were designed to allow pages to change
owner and state without requiring a global lock.  Each page has a page
structure, and a very specific set of access disciplines must be
observed to ensure that pages are freed properly, and that no writable
mappings exist for PV pagetable pages.

Unfortunately, when the XENMEM_exchange hypercall was introduced,
these access disciplines were violated, opening up several potential
race conditions.

IMPACT
======

A single PV guest can leak arbitrary amounts of memory, leading to a
denial of service.

A cooperating pair of PV and HVM/PVH guests can get a writable
pagetable entry, leading to information disclosure or privilege
escalation.

Privilege escalation attacks using only a single PV guest or a pair of
PV guests have not been ruled out.

Note that both of these attacks require very precise timing, which may
be difficult to exploit in practice.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.

Only systems which run PV guests are vulnerable.  Systems which run
only HVM/PVH guests are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM or PVH guests will avoid these vulnerabilities.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
