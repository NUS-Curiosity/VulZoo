            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-18423 / XSA-301
                               version 3

             add-to-physmap can be abused to DoS Arm hosts

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

p2m->max_mapped_gfn is used by the functions
p2m_resolve_translation_fault() and p2m_get_entry() to sanity check
guest physical frame.  The rest of the code in the two functions will
assume that there is a valid root table and check that with BUG_ON().

The function p2m_get_root_pointer() will ignore the unused top bits of
a guest physical frame.  This means that the function p2m_set_entry()
will alias the frame.  However, p2m->max_mapped_gfn will be updated
using the original frame.

It would be possible to set p2m->max_mapped_gfn high enough to cover a
frame that would lead p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL in
p2m_get_entry() and p2m_resolve_translation_fault().

Additionally, the sanity check on p2m->max_mapped_gfn is off-by-one
allowing "highest mapped + 1" to be considered valid.  However,
p2m_get_root_pointer() will return NULL.

The problem could be triggered with a specially crafted hypercall
XENMEM_add_to_physmap{, _batch} followed by an access to an address
(via hypercall or direct access) that passes the sanity check but
cause p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator may cause a hypervisor crash,
resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen version 4.8 and newer are vulnerable.

Only Arm systems are vulnerable.  x86 systems are not affected.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations.

=======

This issue was discovered by Julian Grall of Arm.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
