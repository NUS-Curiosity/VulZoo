Subject: Re:  CVE-2012-1162 / -1163: Incorrect loop construct
 and numeric overflow in libzip

I just realized that only libzip 0.10 is affected by these
vulnerabilities, but not older versions of libzip.

Stefan Cornelius has identified the precise commits that introduced the
vulnerabilities:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=802564
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=803028

As PHP and zipruby include older versions of libzip, they are not
affected by the issues.

Cheers, Timo
