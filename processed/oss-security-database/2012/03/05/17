Subject: CVE-2012-1106 assignment notification -- abrt: Setuid process core
 dump archived with unsafe GID permissions

Hi,

A sensitive information disclosure flaw was found in the way abrt, the
automatic bug detection and reporting tool, performed archiving of certain core
dump files. When the abrt C handler plug-in and core dumps for setuid and
setgid processes were enabled (via fs.suid_dumpable=2), an unprivileged local
user could use this flaw to obtain access to core dump files of setuid
processes, which terminated with crash and were run by the same unprivileged
user, leading to disclosure of sensitive information due to weak GID
permissions, those core dump files were created with.

We have assigned CVE-2012-1106 to this issue.
