Please use CVE-2012-1103 for this issue.

Potentially stupid Q, why no CVE request from Debian? I'm happy to
assign them, especially for stuff that qualifies for a DSA, it will
almost certainly qualify for a CVE. If you need one for an embargoed
issue please email the OpenWall vs list
(http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros) and I can
assign it there.
