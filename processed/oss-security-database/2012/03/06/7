Well, Speed Dreams started with TORCS code base, but they have added a lot
new code, so I would say that right now they have different code base,
although they still share a big portion of the code (as the vulnerable
section).  Because of that I would consider It needs a new CVE number,
could you assign one to it?  :)

 I already did, I sent details but they have not disclosed them in web page
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1189, maybe i used a
wrong email address (cve-assign@...re.org).


Thank you for your help.
