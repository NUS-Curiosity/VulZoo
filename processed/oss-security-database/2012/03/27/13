Actually, I didn't manually encrypt the attachment, but my mail client's PGP
plugin likely did the equivalent.  PGP/MIME is definitely preferred, but since
certain Windows-based mail clients utterly fail at interpreting it properly, I
often fall back to old style PGP when sending messages to strangers.  I think
your updated text helps.

You may want to re-word this a little to make it utterly clear to those who
don't take the time to think about it.  Perhaps something like "If expect
upstream vendors to require more than 14-19 days to develop a fix, establish a
release date with them prior to notifying this list".  You could also break it
down in to step-by-step bullets.  That page has grown much larger now and it is
tempting to skim...

I agree with you that releasing undocumented fixes carries significant risks.
It's become clear to me that the LO/OO projects have a ways to go when it comes
to release engineering.
