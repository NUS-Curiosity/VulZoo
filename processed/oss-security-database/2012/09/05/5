-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-3494 / XSA-12
                             version 3

	      hypercall set_debugreg vulnerability

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

set_debugreg allows writes to reserved bits of the DR7 debug control
register on x86-64.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest can cause the host to crash, leading to a DoS.

If the vulnerable hypervisor is run on future hardware, the impact of
the vulnerability might be widened depending on the future assignment
of the currently-reserved debug register bits.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All systems running 64-bit paravirtualised guests.

The vulnerability dates back to at least Xen 4.0.  4.0, 4.1, the 4.2
RCs, and xen-unstable.hg are all vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be mitigated by ensuring (inside the guest) that the
kernel is trustworthy, or by running only 32-bit or HVM guests.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.
