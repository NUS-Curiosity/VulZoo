Subject: Re: CVE Request (minor) -- JVM: heap memory
 disclosure (possibly various JDKs)

Hello Steve,

  thank you for the clarification.

That's true, my yesterday's request was too wide, because in that moment we were
not sure yet, which concrete JVM implementations would be affected by this
deficiency (and which not).

Anyway, upon David's review (Cc-ed too) we can announce that this problem would
affect / is specific only to Oracle Java SE 7 (java-1.7.0-oracle), and
Java SE 7 as provided by OpenJDK 7 (java-1.7.0-openjdk).

So after above suggestion we will use CVE-2012-4416 for Oracle's codebase /
Oracle supported JVM and the OpenJDK one should obtain another CVE identifier.

I will clarify this situation in our bugs too yet.

Kurt, could you allocate another CVE id then for the OpenJDK part of the
story?

Florian clarified on this already (why to assign CVE id for these is appropriate
approach).

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
