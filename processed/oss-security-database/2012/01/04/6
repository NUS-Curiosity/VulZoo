-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

MITRE is still working on this. Our current perspective is that
CVE-2011-4084 is one vulnerability that was confirmed by the upstream
vendor, and CVE-2011-4858 is a different vulnerability that was not
confirmed by the upstream vendor. There are apparently related test
cases and test results that are not yet public.
