Subject: Re: CVE request: PostfixAdmin SQL injections and XSS


>>> Please assign a CVE number to those issues.
>>>
>>> The issues are fixed in PostfixAdmin 2.3.5, which I'll release
>>> today or tomorrow.
>>>
>>> For reference, here's the changelog with all details:
>>>   - fix SQL injection in pacrypt() (if $CONF[encrypt] ==
>>>   'mysql_encrypt') 
>>>   - fix SQL injection in backup.php - the dump
>>>   was not mysql_escape()d,>   
>>>     therefore users could inject SQL (for example in the
>>>     vacation message) which will be executed when restoring
>>>     the database dump. WARNING: database dumps created with
>>>     backup.php from 2.3.4 or older might>     
>>>              contain malicious SQL. Double-check
>>>              before using them!

Please use CVE-2012-0811 for PostfixAdmin 2.3.4 multiple SQL vulnerabilities

>>>   - fix XSS with $_GET[domain] in templates/menu.php and
>>>   edit-vacation - fix XSS in some create-domain input fields
>>>   - fix XSS in create-alias and edit-alias error message
>>>   - fix XSS (by values stored in the database) in fetchmail list

Please use CVE-2012-0812 for PostfixAdmin 2.3.4 multiple XSS
vulnerabilities
