Subject: XSLT issue in MoinMoin

Hello,

some vulnerabilities have been published with version 1.9.3 of
MoinMoin : http://moinmo.in/SecurityFixes

The XSS already has a CVE but not the XSLT issue. This issue is very
similar to CVE-2012-0057 patched in PHP 5.3.9 (except the XSLT engine
which is here '4Suite').

The patch is simply a documentation update, given that 4Suite (afaik)
doesn't allow to desactivate its extensions :
http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.9/rev/99e2309a7ec0

Regards,
Nicolas Grégoire
