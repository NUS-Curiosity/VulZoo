Subject: Re: CVE id assignment dates


Alexander,

This misconception is, unfortunately, all too common.  I will look into 
ways of changing it on the CVE web site.

The Assigned date, strictly defined, is the date on which the specific CVE 
*number* was first created and "committed" to the CVE database.  There is 
no guaranteed relationship between the public disclosure date and the 
Assigned date.

When a CNA receives a pool of numbers, the Assigned date is when that pool 
was created by MITRE.  A CNA pool is just a list of CVE numbers that 
aren't even associated with a specific vulnerability.

When MITRE reserves a CVE candidate for an independent, non-CNA party, the 
"Assigned" date reflects the day that we reserved the candidate - which is 
sometimes before the issue is published, and sometimes even before the 
vendor is notified.

In other cases, MITRE independently assigns new CVEs for already-disclosed 
vulnerabilities, and the Assigned date reflects when we created those 
CVEs.  In this case, the Assigned date can be AFTER the original 
disclosure date.

We do not publish any dates related to disclosure, patch, or vendor 
notification; interested parties can consult other databases that 
explicitly track this information, such as OSVDB.
