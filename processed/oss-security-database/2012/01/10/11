I apologize, I'm still getting used to Thunderbird (Vince says I should
use mutt, I suspect he may be correct) which places the subject line
well above the message body so when I scan it I'm usually looking at the
To: and CC: line and not seeing the subject (as evidenced by me asking
stupid questions like this about once a day =).

Please use CVE-2012-0038 for this kernel issue.
