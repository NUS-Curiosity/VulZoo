CVE-2011-4858 refers to the JVM hash collision vulnerability as it
affects Apache Tomcat.

The Apache Tomcat security team made the following announcement
regarding this issue:
http://markmail.org/message/jni4gb5biaolh66t

CVE-2011-4084 was going to be used for an DoS issue unrelated to hash
collisions but due to the confusion caused by oCERT incorrectly using
- -4084 rather than -4858 in their announcement of the hash collision
issue -4084 will be marked as rejected and a new CVE reference will be
used for the DoS issue unrelated to hash collisions. When the Tomcat
security team is ready to publish details of that issue, it will do so
under a completely new CVE.
