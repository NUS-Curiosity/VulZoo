Subject: Xen Security Advisory 27 (CVE-2012-5511) - several HVM operations
 do not validate the range of their inputs

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-5511 / XSA-27
                           version 4

   several HVM operations do not validate the range of their inputs

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Several HVM control operations do not check the size of their inputs
and can tie up a physical CPU for extended periods of time.

In addition dirty video RAM tracking involves clearing the bitmap
provided by the domain controlling the guest (e.g. dom0 or a
stubdom). If the size of that bitmap is overly large, an intermediate
variable on the hypervisor stack may overflow that stack.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to become unresponsive
or to crash leading in either case to a Denial of Service.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions from 3.4 onwards are vulnerable.

However Xen 4.2 and unstable are not vulnerable to the stack
overflow. Systems running either of these are not vulnerable to the
crash.

Version 3.4, 4.0 and 4.1 are vulnerable to both the stack overflow and
the physical CPU hang.

The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
