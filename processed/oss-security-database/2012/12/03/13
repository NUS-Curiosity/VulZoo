1. Background
=============

Bogofilter is a software package for classifying a message as spam or
non-spam.  It uses a data base to store words and must be trained
which messages are spam and non-spam. It uses the probabilities of
individual words for classifying the message.

Note that the bogofilter project is issuing security announcements only
for current "stable" releases, and not necessarily for past "stable"
releases.

2. Problem description
======================

Julius Plenz figured out that bogofilter's/bogolexer's base64 could
overwrite heap memory in the character set conversion in certain
pathological cases of invalid base64 code that decodes to incomplete
multibyte characters.

3. Impact
=========

Vulnerable bogofilter/bogolexer applications can corrupt their heap and
crash.

4. Solution
===========

Upgrade your bogofilter to version 1.2.3 (or a newer release).

bogofilter is available from SourceForge:
<https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=62265>
