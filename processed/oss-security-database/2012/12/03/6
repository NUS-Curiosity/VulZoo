Subject: Xen Security Advisory 26 (CVE-2012-5510) - Grant table version
 switch list corruption vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-5510 / XSA-26
                             version 3

       Grant table version switch list corruption vulnerability

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Downgrading the grant table version of a guest involves freeing its
status pages. This freeing was incomplete - the page(s) are freed back
to the allocator, but not removed from the domain's tracking
list. This would cause list corruption, eventually leading to a
hypervisor crash.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to crash, leading to a
denial of service attack.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen version from 4.0 on are vulnerable.

Version 3.4 and earlier are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only guests with trusted kernels will avoid this vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
