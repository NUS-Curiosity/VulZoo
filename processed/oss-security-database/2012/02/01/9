Yeah, took a quick look, to quote the XChat-WDK site:

-----------------
XChat is an IRC chat program. It allows you to join multiple IRC
channels (chat rooms) at the same time, talk publicly, private
one-on-one conversations etc.

XChat-WDK is a patchset for XChat SVN which allows for building on
Windows using the Windows Driver Kit. This results in binaries usable
across all versions of Windows starting from XP (read why).
-----------------

So that sounds like a limited fork, so basically the same code base,
Additionally the same fix applies to both xchat and xchat-WDK,
indicating the code is basically the same so I'll assign a single CVE
for it.

Please use CVE-2012-0828 for this issue.
