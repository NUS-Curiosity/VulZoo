Subject: Fwd: Apache HTTP Server 2.2.22 Released

I think that only posting to oss-security when there's not yet a CVE ID
assigned (to request one) is weird.  I think it may be more beneficial
to post in here about all security issues in Open Source software -
well, or at least in widely used pieces of software.  As a special case,
when an issue that was first discussed on the private linux-distros or
distros lists is made public, I think this should include a posting to
oss-security (and not only vendor advisories sent via their usual
channels, which vary by vendor).  (No, the Apache issues below were not
on the distros lists.)

                       Apache HTTP Server 2.2.22 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache HTTP Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 2.2.22 of the Apache HTTP
   Server ("Apache").  This version of Apache is principally a security
   and bug fix release, including the following significant security fixes:

   * SECURITY: CVE-2011-3368 (cve.mitre.org)
     Reject requests where the request-URI does not match the HTTP
     specification, preventing unexpected expansion of target URLs in
     some reverse proxy configurations.

   * SECURITY: CVE-2011-3607 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fix integer overflow in ap_pregsub() which, when the mod_setenvif module
     is enabled, could allow local users to gain privileges via a .htaccess
     file.

   * SECURITY: CVE-2011-4317 (cve.mitre.org)
     Resolve additional cases of URL rewriting with ProxyPassMatch or
     RewriteRule, where particular request-URIs could result in undesired
     backend network exposure in some configurations.

   * SECURITY: CVE-2012-0021 (cve.mitre.org)
     mod_log_config: Fix segfault (crash) when the '%{cookiename}C' log format
     string is in use and a client sends a nameless, valueless cookie, causing
     a denial of service. The issue existed since version 2.2.17.

   * SECURITY: CVE-2012-0031 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fix scoreboard issue which could allow an unprivileged child process
     could cause the parent to crash at shutdown rather than terminate
     cleanly.

   * SECURITY: CVE-2012-0053 (cve.mitre.org)
     Fixed an issue in error responses that could expose "httpOnly" cookies
     when no custom ErrorDocument is specified for status code 400.

   The Apache HTTP Project thanks halfdog, Context Information Security Ltd,
   Prutha Parikh of Qualys, and Norman Hippert for bringing these issues to
   the attention of the security team.

   We consider this release to be the best version of Apache available, and
   encourage users of all prior versions to upgrade.

   Apache HTTP Server 2.2.22 is available for download from:

     http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

   Please see the CHANGES_2.2 file, linked from the download page, for a
   full list of changes.  A condensed list, CHANGES_2.2.22 includes only
   those changes introduced since the prior 2.2 release.  A summary of all
   of the security vulnerabilities addressed in this and earlier releases
   is available:

     http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_22.html

   This release includes the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) version 1.4.5
   and APR Utility Library (APR-util) version 1.4.2, bundled with the tar
   and zip distributions.  The APR libraries libapr and libaprutil (and
   on Win32, libapriconv version 1.2.1) must all be updated to ensure
   binary compatibility and address many known security and platform bugs.
   APR-util version 1.4 represents a minor version upgrade from earlier
   httpd source distributions, which previously included version 1.3.

   Apache 2.2 offers numerous enhancements, improvements, and performance
   boosts over the 2.0 codebase.  For an overview of new features
   introduced since 2.0 please see:

     http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/new_features_2_2.html

   This release builds on and extends the Apache 2.0 API.  Modules written
   for Apache 2.0 will need to be recompiled in order to run with Apache
   2.2, and require minimal or no source code changes.

     http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpd/httpd/branches/2.2.x/VERSIONING

   When upgrading or installing this version of Apache, please bear in mind
   that if you intend to use Apache with one of the threaded MPMs (other
   than the Prefork MPM), you must ensure that any modules you will be
   using (and the libraries they depend on) are thread-safe.
