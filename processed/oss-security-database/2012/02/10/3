Sory for not being clear. I am not sure what the CVE-identifier is as I told in my last email to this thread. New cases I have seen: http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2262 http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0492 latter link with a list of "a different vulnerability than". I do NOT have any facts about these vulnerabilities. I hope Oracle coordinates issues like these with MITRE/US-CERT and adds more information to advisory and CVE after these are 100% public and distros are ready.
