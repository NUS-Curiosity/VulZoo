Subject: CVE-2012-5532 hypervkvpd DoS

Just a heads-up on a flaw that was found:

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered that hypervkvpd
would exit when it processed a spoofed Netlink packet that had been sent from
an untrusted local user, in the following code:

         len = recvfrom(fd, kvp_recv_buffer, sizeof(kvp_recv_buffer), 0,
                 addr_p, &addr_l);

         if (len < 0 || addr.nl_pid) {
             syslog(LOG_ERR, "recvfrom failed; pid:%u error:%d %s",
                     addr.nl_pid, errno, strerror(errno));
             close(fd);
             return -1;
         }

This has been corrected upstream already.
