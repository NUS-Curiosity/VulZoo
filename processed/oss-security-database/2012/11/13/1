                       Timer overflow DoS vulnerability

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

A guest which sets a VCPU with an inappropriate deadline can cause an
infinite loop in Xen, blocking the affected physical CPU
indefinitely.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can trigger the bug.  If the Xen
watchdog is enabled, the whole system will crash.  Otherwise the guest
can cause the system to become completely unresponsive.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen from at least 3.4 onwards are vulnerable, to every
kind of guest.

Systems with only trusted guest kernels are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no mitigation available other than to use a trusted guest
kernel.

RESOLUTION
==========

The attached patch resolves this issue.  The same patch is applicable
to all affected versions.
