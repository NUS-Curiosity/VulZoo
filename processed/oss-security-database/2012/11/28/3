I believe this one was meant to be CVE-2012-2252...

I've uploaded rssh-2.3.4 to the project's web page, as well as to
sourceforge.  This update includes the fix for CVE-2012-2252, and also
rolls up a fix for CVE-2012-3478, for which I had previously only
posted a patch.  Additionally there are some mostly trivial updates
for code and build clean-up.
