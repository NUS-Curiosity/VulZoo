Subject: libtiff: Stack based buffer overflow when handling DOTRANGE tags

Hi All,

I found a stack-based buffer overflow in the way libtiff handled
DOTRANGE tags. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially-
crafted TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application linked
against libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

This issue is fixed in libtiff-4.0.2

We have assigned CVE-2012-5581 to this issue.
