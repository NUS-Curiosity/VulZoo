Subject: CVE Request -- Dancer.pm / perl-Dancer / libdancer-perl: Newline
 injection due to improper CRLF escaping in cookie() and cookies() methods
 (different vulnerability than CVE-2012-5526)

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  a security flaw was found in the way Dancer.pm,
lightweight yet powerful web application framework
/ Perl language module, performed sanitization of
values to be used for cookie() and cookies() methods.
A remote attacker could use this flaw to inject arbitrary
headers into responses from (Perl) applications, that use
Dancer.pm. A different vulnerability than CVE-2012-5526.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

P.S.: The issue is different / unrelated than similar
      recent CGI.pm, CVE-2012-5526, flaw (the presence
      / absence of the CGI.pm CVE-2012-5526 fix doesn't
      have impact on it).
