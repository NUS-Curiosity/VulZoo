Subject: Openjpeg: heap-buffer overflow when processing JPEG2000 image files

Hi All,

We have found a heap-buffer overflow in openjpeg, details are as
follows:

Description:
A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way OpenJPEG, an
open-source JPEG 2000 codec written in C language, performed parsing of
JPEG2000 having certain number of tiles and tilesizes. A remote
attacker could provide a specially crafted JPEG 2000 file, which when
opened in an application linked against openjpeg would lead to that
application crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running the application.

Upstream patch:
