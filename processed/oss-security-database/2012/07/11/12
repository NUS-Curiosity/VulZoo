Responded off-list.

Advisory updated to reference CVE-2012-2907.

We use "multiple vulnerabilities" in the title when the listing all
fixed vulnerabilities becomes cumbersome. I agree it's not ideal. I
believe that the lack of validation in the login theft is separate
from the CSRF. Ben Adida is familiar with it and could potentially
give advice.

True disclosure in CVE-2012-3798 only happens if an attacker gains
access to the user's session object (e.g. due to loss of a database
backup or an insecure memcache configuration). We mention that as a
poor security practice that was improved, but aren't sure what class
of vulnerability that should be and whether it really deserves to be
called out separately. There have been several other instances where
credentials or credential-like information is stored unencrypted in a
location that seems like a bad idea because it's more likely to be
leaked (e.g. the sessions database table) but where it's not a direct
immediate threat. Any advice on whether you feel those truly deserve a
CVE assignment?

I have not updated the advisory to include CVE-2012-3798.

Indeed there is a CSRF issue separate from the XSS. Advisory updated with both.

Advisory updated with both CVEs.

Thanks for the review and additional CVEs, Steve.
