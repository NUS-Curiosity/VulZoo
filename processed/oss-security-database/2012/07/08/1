Seeing as how I have heard back from security@...dpress.org on another
matter, but not this one (nor has Steve said "don't do it" =), I can
only assume CVE #'s have not been assigned. If CVE's were issued for
these issues they have not been published anywhere I can find them.
Google:

site:wordpress.org CVE-2012

returns 12 results, most of which are CVE-2012-1835.

Hopefully these are in fact only hardening issues and not security
issues, so no CVE. More details (like links to the code commits) would
be appreciated though.
