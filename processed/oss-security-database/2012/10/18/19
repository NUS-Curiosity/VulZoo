Hi Kurt,
Issues only affecting testing/unstable should always be assigned a CVE ID
nonetheless. The Debian ecosystem is much more than stable alone:
There is a great deal of derivative distributions [1], which import packages
from Debian testing/unstable and having a CVE ID is a convenient way to
track whether they are affected.

Cheers,
