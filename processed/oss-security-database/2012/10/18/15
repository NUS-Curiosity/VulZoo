So, at the risk of sounding nitpicky, the Debian testing + unstable
archives are pretty much equivalent to Fedora rawhide.  Even though
Redhat's position is that issues affecting only rawhide should not get
CVE identifiers, in Debian I think we should try to be more honest, so
we'll assign identifiers to all "uploaded" versions (in Debian, we use
the term upload to mean that a package is available in an archive vice
the term release).

Best wishes,
