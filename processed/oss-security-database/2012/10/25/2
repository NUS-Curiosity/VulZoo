Subject: CVE request: awstats before 7.1 awredir.pl vulnerability

http://awstats.sourceforge.net/docs/awstats_changelog.txt
- Security fix into awredir.pl

I didn't find any more info, but please assign a CVE.
(and i found there were awredir issues before that got CVE-2009-5020,
but I think this is a different issue, at least if their changelogs are
correct)
