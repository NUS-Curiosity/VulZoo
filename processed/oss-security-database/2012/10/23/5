Subject: Wrong affected version in the CVE-2012-4511

The description says:

services/flickr/flickr.c in libsocialweb before 0.25.22 automatically connects 
to Flickr when no Flickr account is set, which might allow remote attackers to 
obtain sensitive information via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

but Rob Bradford in the Red Hat bugzilla said:
That's odd - when I did "yum remove libsocialweb" it didn't threaten to remove 
anything else (well, except libsocialweb-keys...:-)
Anyway there is a 0.25.21 on the servers for you.

and, for the record the version 0.25.22 does not exist.

So I think we need "s/22/21"
Can someone take care of this issue?
