FWIW, I have added a check to unix-privesc-check for privileged binaries that 
have "PATH=" embedded in them and run it over a couple of fairly vanilla 
Debian systems with KDE on it and seen a few other cases of embedded PATHs.  
This yielded a few cases where "privileged" binaries trust 
/usr/local/{bin/sbin} but nothing else untoward. trunk is currently in flux, 
but vendors may wish to incorporate it into their release testing in due 
course.
