Yes, we have previously checked with Daniel and he confirmed this one -^ would be
the correct one.

(have updated our bugzilla entry to state it in more exact way:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=822109#c2)

Without not to leak too much, Daniel also clarified this problem would be
of higher impact / security relevance for Google Chrome instances due the
way they use XPointer functionality. On common Linux libxml2 instances
additional functionality to be involved is needed this to be exploited
in that way as it has been for Google Chrome case.

Hope this helps. Let us know if we can be of any further advice.

Regards, Jan.
