Reading the discussion here,

  <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/213981>

it seems to me that this is just a performance optimization which
could be bypassed by using different flags, so I don't think there's a
vulnerability or fix here, except the general lack of source IP
address validation in IP networks.
