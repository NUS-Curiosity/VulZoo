Subject: Update of upstream patch links for AST-2012-007 / CVE-2012-2947 advisory
 needed

Hello Richard,

   this is due the links to patches, as being listed in AST-2012-007 advisory:
   [1] http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-007.html

They are obviously result of copy-n-paste problem from previous upstream AST-2012-006
advisory:
1) Though link name being http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-007-1.8.11-cert.diff
    it points to:
    http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-006-1.8.diff

2) http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-007-1.8.diff (link name) =>
    http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-006-1.8.diff (link target)

3) http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-007-10.diff (link name) =>
    http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2012-006-1.8.diff (link target)

 From what I can tell (from upstream ticket), the proper AST-2012-007 upstream patch
for v1.8.x branch is this one:
https://code.asterisk.org/code/rdiff/asterisk/branches/1.8/channels/chan_iax2.c?r1=366880&r2=367781&u&N

Could you please update the links in AST-2012-007 for other branches too, so they
would reflect relevant */chan_iax2.c change?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
