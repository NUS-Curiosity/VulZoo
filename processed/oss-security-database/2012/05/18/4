That's a very different scenario than this one as I understand it.
TORCS actually has a realistic requirement for using TORCS files
supplied by the user (that are downloaded from remote sites/etc.).

In the case of Planeshift the chatbubbles.xml is not supplied by the
user, it comes with the program and is installed into a system
directory. This is very different from the TORCS situation. If you can
convince a user to start replacing system config files than almost
every program needs a CVE by that definition (I can think of a few
hundred programs on Linux that have config files that result in other
programs/script/commands being run that can be easily obfuscated to do
nastiness).

Steven: comments, do you think this needs a CVE?
