Subject: Security issue in libav/ffmpeg

A heap corruption security bug[1] was reported by Fabian Yamaguchi
against libav in Ubuntu. This issue also affected ffmpeg.

This issue is now public and has been assigned CVE-2012-0947.

Attached is a patch from upstream libav to fix the issue (thanks to M책ns
Rullg책rd). While the issue also affected ffmpeg, upstream ffmpeg fixed
this some time ago in 3583c8706df0abbfa3ecdd6730f4f3d72a01fe6d.
