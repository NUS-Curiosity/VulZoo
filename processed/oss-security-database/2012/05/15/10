This is the CVE-2012-2352 that you assigned, upstream Sympa has now
created a page for security issues, this is one is detailed on there:

These issues were fixed a very long time ago, there was a security
advisory in 2010, here is the French CERT advisory for them:

http://www.certa.ssi.gouv.fr/site/CERTA-2010-AVI-505/

It appears that besides this most recent CVE, the only CVEs issued for
Sympa have been in 2008, so these were not assigned numbers.

ps - I would sign this message, but it seems like it would be eaten by
EZLM :(
