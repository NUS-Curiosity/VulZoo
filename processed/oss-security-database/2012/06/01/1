It's not clear to me why you would want to allow SYN+FIN at all.  So far
as I have been able to discover t is only used for T/TCP which was
obsoleted in May 2011 by RFC6247 which said this:

RFC4614 has this to say:

I'm not averse to this being an iptables problem, I just wondered why
that is the case given the reasons for making T/TCP historic.
