It still makes sense.   There's no easy mechanism to let the hypervisor pass the do-not-create-domU message to dom0 so that the person creating the guest will find out.   There's also a logical problem: dom0 is itself a PV guest.

The admin can take preventative action to disable untrusted PV guests and stopping the system booting is definitely the best way of attracting attention without having potentially difficult to diagnose problems.
