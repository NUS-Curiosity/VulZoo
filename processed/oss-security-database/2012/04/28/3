These might be related (at least the second one):

http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/81329 http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2012-1495
http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/81330 http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2012-1496

I can request more details from the vendor and email Mitre so we get those CVEs updated.
