Hi,

You can read all about the details of the vulnerability in the Black Hat
2012 presentation by Charlie Miller
(http://media.blackhat.com/bh-us-12/Briefings/C_Miller/BH_US_12_Miller_NFC_attack_surface_WP.pdf)
-- details of the Calligra (and KOffice) exploit start at page 39.

Unfortunately, he did not notify us ahead of time of his intent to
disclose, so it's already public.

Thanks,
Jeff
