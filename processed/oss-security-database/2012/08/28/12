Subject: CVE Request: Hash collision issue in Mono/C# (similar to Microsoft
	.NET issue)

Hi,

The hash collision problem can also be found in the C# Mono implementation.

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3414
describes the issue for the Microsoft .NET runtime, but as the issue
is also in the Mono implementation it needs a different
CVE there.
