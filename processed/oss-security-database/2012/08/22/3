Subject: Any information on mesa/CVE-2012-2864?

Hi,
I noticed the following on
http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.de/2012/08/stable-channel-update-for-chrome-os.html :

    [$3133.7] [141901] Critical CVE-2012-2864: Mesa array overflow. Credit to miaubiz.

The Google bug tracker entry is closed, does anyone have additional information?

Cheers,
        Moritz
