This is a duplicate of CVE-2012-0808, assigned back in January (and also 
requested by Moritz ;-)  CVE-2012-0808 has 20,000+ Google hits, has an 
established description, was assigned earlier, and has the same level of 
authoritative vendor references (i.e. bug reports).  So, we will keep it.

So, REJECT CVE-2012-3379 as a duplicate of CVE-2012-0808.
