Subject: ownCloud - matching CVEs to fix information and vice versa

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Ok so I started looking at ownCloud to make sure I didn't issue a
duplicate.

We have the following 4 CVE entries for ownCloud and no way to match
them to a fixed version.

CVE-2012-2398	Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
files/ajax/download.php in ownCloud 3.0.2 allows remote attackers to
inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the files parameter, a
different vulnerability than CVE-2012-2269.4. NOTE: the provenance of
this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from
third party information.

Is CVE-2012-2398 fixed in 3.0.3?

CVE-2012-2397	Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in
ownCloud 3.0.2 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of
arbitrary users for requests that insert cross-site scripting (XSS)
sequences via vectors involving contacts. NOTE: the provenance of this
information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third
party information.

Is CVE-2012-2397 fixed in 3.0.3?

CVE-2012-2270	Open redirect vulnerability in index.php (aka the Login
Page) in ownCloud 3.0.0 allows remote attackers to redirect users to
arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL in the
redirect_url parameter.

Is CVE-2012-2270 fixed in 3.0.1?

CVE-2012-2269	Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
ownCloud 3.0.0 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
or HTML via (1) an arbitrary field to apps/contacts/ajax/addcard.php,
(2) the parameter parameter to apps/contacts/ajax/addproperty.php, (3)
the name parameter to apps/contacts/ajax/createaddressbook, (4) the
file parameter to files/download.php, or the (5) name, (6) user, or
(7) redirect_url parameter to files/index.php.

Is CVE-2012-2269 fixed in 3.0.1
