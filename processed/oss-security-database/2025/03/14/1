As a follow-up to that (sorry to keep trickling in information) - it
turns out a third commit is required

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/commit/c71eb22dde1a3101891a865fdac20a6de814267d

FT_QNEW_ARRAY does not do the right thing without this commit, as it
was calling FT_MEM_NEW_ARRAY instead of FT_MEM_QNEW_ARRAY

The fixes I'm working with both the Meta security folks and the EL
community (CentOS / AlmaLinux) can be tracked
herehttps://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/freetype/-/merge_requests/8/diffs

https://gitlab.com/CentOS/Hyperscale/rpms/freetype/-/commits/c9s-hs?ref_type=heads

(we've had to fix it several times in Hyperscale too)

I've tried to keep it well documented so hopefully it's of use to those
trying to patch older releases such as 2.10.4

Best regards,
