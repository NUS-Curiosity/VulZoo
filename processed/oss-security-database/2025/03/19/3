SECURITY-3404 / CVE-2020-36843
EDDSA API Plugin makes the EdDSA-Java library (`ed25519-java`) available to
other plugins.

EDDSA API Plugin 0.3.0-13.v7cb_69ed68f00 and earlier bundles version 0.3.0
of EdDSA-Java, which exhibits signature malleability and does not satisfy
the SUF-CMA (Strong Existential Unforgeability under Chosen Message
Attacks) property. This allows attackers to create new valid signatures
different from previous signatures for a known message.


SECURITY-3529 / CVE-2025-30196
AnchorChain Plugin 1.0 does not limit URL schemes for links it creates
based on workspace content, allowing the `javascript:` scheme.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control the input file for the Anchor
Chain post-build step.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3511 / CVE-2025-30197
Zoho QEngine Plugin stores the QEngine API Key in job `config.xml` files on
the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

While this key is stored encrypted on disk, in Zoho QEngine Plugin
1.0.29.vfa_cc23396502 and earlier the job configuration form does not mask
the QEngine API Key form field, increasing the potential for attackers to
observe and capture it.
