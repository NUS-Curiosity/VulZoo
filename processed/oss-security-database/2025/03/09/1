Subject: CVE-2025-27636: Apache Camel: Camel Message Header Injection via
 Improper Filtering 

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Camel 4.10.0 before 4.10.2
- Apache Camel 4.8.0 before 4.8.5
- Apache Camel 3.10.0 before 3.22.4

Description:

Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel.

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 through <= 4.10.1, from 4.8.0 through <= 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through <= 3.22.3.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.

The vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with "Camel", "camel", or "org.apache.camel.". Attackers can bypass this filter by altering the casing of letters. This allows attackers to inject headers which can be exploited to invoke arbitrary methods from the Bean registry and also supports using Simple Expression Language (or OGNL in some cases) as part of the method parameters passed to the bean. It's important to note that only methods in the same bean declared in the bean URI could be invoked.


Mitigation: You can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing the headers in your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, also globally or per route. This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like "cAmel, cAMEL" etc, or in general everything not starting with "Camel", "camel" or "org.apache.camel.".

This issue is being tracked as CAMEL-21838
