Subject: pam_pkcs11: Possible Authentication Bypass in Error Situations
 (CVE-2025-24531)

Hello list,

this report was previously sent to the linux-distros mailing list with
an embargo period of 7 days, which ended today. The following report
contains minor changes compared with the (draft) version shared on
linux-distros.

We also offer a rendered version of this report on our blog [1].

1) Introduction
===============

This report is about a regression in pam_pkcs11 [2] version 0.6.12 [3].
In this release the implementation of `pam_sm_authenticate()` [4] has
been changed to return `PAM_IGNORE` in many exit paths, which can lead
to a complete authentication bypass in some scenarios. This report is
based on upstream Git tag "pam_pkcs11-0.6.12". A bugfix is found in
release 0.6.13 [5].

Whether this issue can be exploited is a complex question that depends a
lot on the system configuration. The following section gives some
insight into how we discovered the issue and why its severity can be
high in some circumstances. Section 3) looks in detail into the issue
found in pam_pkcs11. The rest of the report explores which Linux
distributions might be affected by the issue, a possible workaround and
the upstream bugfix. Finally we will be taking a look at the lessons
that can be learned from this finding.

2) Discovery of the Issue / Relation to GDM Smart Card Authentication
=====================================================================

Fellow SUSE engineer Marcus Rückert uses a YubiKey for login at his
openSUSE Tumbleweed desktop system. In October 2024 he noticed a change
[6] in behaviour in his GDM login setup. By digging a bit deeper he
noticed that in some situations login was possible without entering a
password or using his YubiKey at all.

While analysing the issue we found that there is a bug [7] (or a
feature?) in GDM 3 that causes YubiKeys to be treated as smart cards.
This is one ingredient that comes into play here. A number of Linux
distributions use a dedicated "gdm-smartcard" PAM stack configuration
file for smart card login in GDM. On openSUSE we rely on pam_pkcs11 as
the sole (proper) authentication module in this gdm-smartcard PAM stack
[8]. It took us a while to understand where exactly this gdm-smartcard
PAM stack is used in GDM. The logic to select this PAM stack is found in
a wholly different Gnome component, namely gnome-shell [9]. There, some
JavaScript is responsible for detecting smart cards via the D-Bus
interface of the gnome-settings-daemon, and for changing the
authentication mode of GDM.

We reproduced the situation by using smart card emulation in a QEMU
Virtual machine, to be able to achieve proper smart card detection in
both GDM and pam_pkcs11. As soon as the smart card is properly setup in
the system, GDM switches into smart card authentication mode (support
for this is enabled by default). A user list is no longer shown in the
display manager, instead the username has to be entered manually. After
entering the username, the "gdm-smartcard" PAM stack is executed, and
with it pam_pkcs11. No password is asked for and login succeeds.

What happens in this test setup, as well as in the real life setup using
a YubiKey, is that pam_pkcs11 stops execution after logging "Failed to
initialize crypto" and, surprisingly, login succeeds. The reason for
this lies in pam_pkcs11, as is described in the next section.

We did not investigate why exactly the "initialize crypto" error occurs,
as we don't believe it is relevant for the security issue. Even when
errors occur, the outcome of the PAM stack execution shouldn't allow
authentication without providing credentials.

3) The `PAM_IGNORE` Issue in pam_pkcs11
========================================

The successful login without proper authentication in pam_pkcs11 stems
from a change that found its way into pam_pkcs11 version 0.6.12. The
issue has been introduced with commit bac6cf8 [10] (note that there
seems to exist an artifact in the upstream Git repository: a seemingly
identical commit 88a87d5 [11] in the commit log on "master").

With this change, many exit paths of the `pam_sm_authenticate()` [4]
function now return `PAM_IGNORE` instead of `PAM_CRED_INSUFFICIENT`. In
particular, the code found at line 284 [12] means that the default
return value on error conditions is `PAM_IGNORE`, if there is no "login
token name":

    if (!configuration->card_only || !login_token_name) {
        /* Allow to pass to the next module if the auth isn't
           restricted to card only. */
        pkcs11_pam_fail = PAM_IGNORE;
    } else {
      pkcs11_pam_fail = PAM_CRED_INSUFFICIENT;
    }

The `card_only` flag refers to a module parameter [13], whose meaning
seems to have changed over time and is no longer fully conforming to
what is documented. It is enabled in the "gdm-smartcard" stack, thus
this part of the `if` condition will not trigger. The background of the
`login_token_name` is that the PAM module contains special logic for
unlocking the screen saver, but only if the session login was performed
using pam_pkcs11. This will always be `false` during initial login, and
thus this part of the `if` condition applies in this case.

When a PAM module returns `PAM_IGNORE`, its outcome should not be used
to determine the result of the PAM stack execution. openSUSE uses the
`required` control setting for pam_pkcs11 in its "gdm-smartcard"
configuration. In extended PAM syntax `required` is expressed like this:

    required
        [success=ok new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=bad]

When pam_pkcs11 returns `PAM_IGNORE` then the "required" control setting
no longer results in what the average administrator will expect, namely
that authentication fails if no successful smart card authentication is
possible.

What happens instead depends on the rest of the modules present in the
"auth" section on the PAM stack. When no other PAM module at all is on
the stack, then authentication fails, because the PAM library expects at
least one decisive return value from any module on the stack. When there
is another PAM module on the stack that actually authenticates, then
that module will set a failed state if no credentials are provided,
thereby preventing successful login.

To judge the situation with the "gdm-smartcard" PAM stack, let's look
more closely at its "auth" section:

    auth       requisite                   pam_faillock.so      preauth
    auth       required                    pam_pkcs11.so        wait_for_card card_only
    auth       required                    pam_shells.so
    auth       requisite                   pam_nologin.so
    auth       optional                    pam_permit.so
    auth       required                    pam_env.so
    auth       [success=ok default=1]      pam_gdm.so
    auth       optional                    pam_gnome_keyring.so

There are a lot of other modules configured, alas, none of them is
actually authenticating. These are what we like to call "utility
modules" in this discussion: they provide support functions. Examples
are the pam_faillock module which checks whether excess authentication
errors occurred, or pam_gnome_keyring which attempts to intercept the
cleartext password used for login to transparently unlock the user
keyring. Commonly, such modules return `PAM_SUCCESS` in most situations.
As a result, when pam_pkcs11 returns `PAM_IGNORE`, the overall outcome
of the PAM authentication will become `PAM_SUCCESS`, supplied by
non-authenticating modules in the "gdm-smartcard" PAM stack.

Below the code location in `pam_sm_authenticate()` function shown above,
only two code paths return something other than `PAM_IGNORE`:

- in line 510 if `pkcs11_login()` fails [14]
- in line 695 f `verify_signature()` fails [15]

Both return paths will reset `pkcs11_pam_fail` to a safe `PAM_AUTH_ERR`
value.  The following is a list of all the other return paths which will
return `PAM_IGNORE`:

- line 305: if a user is logging in from remote, or can
  control the DISPLAY environment variable (e.g. in sudo context). [16]
- line 316: if the `crypto_init()` call fails. [17]
- line 328: if a screen saver context is detected and no login token is
  recorded, then an explicit jump to a `PAM_IGNORE` return is performed. [18]
- lines 343, 357: if loading or initializing the PKCS#11 module fails. [19]
- line 374: if the configured token is not found and `card_only` is not set [20].
  This might be okay in light of the semantics of `card_only`, but it is
  still strange. If system administrators want to make pam_pkcs11
  authentication optional then they can do so by using the PAM stack
  configuration already, by using the `optional` control setting.
  Changing the module result semantics this drastically through a
  seemingly harmless module option is unusual.
- line 416: if no smart card is found even after potentially waiting for it [21].
  If a smart card is found, but one of various PKCS#11 library functions or certificate
  checks fail, then further `PAM_IGNORE` returns can happen if any of the
  following operations fail:
  - `open_pkcs11_session()` (line 432)
  - `get_slot_login_required()` (line 443)
  - when reading in a password fails (line 471)
  - empty password was read without `nullok` set (line 486)
  - `get_certificate_list()` (line 522)
  - `pam_set_item(..., PAM_USER, ...)` (line 597)
  - `match_user()` (line 613)
  - `(no matching certificate found)` (line 634)
  - `get_random_value()` (line 663)
  - `sign_value()` (line 677)
  - `close_pkcs11_session()` (line 776)

As this long list demonstrates, it is likely that a local attacker will
be able to provoke a `PAM_IGNORE` return value in pam_pkcs11. For a
physical attacker the simplest way is to insert an arbitrary smart card
into an existing reader, or attach a peripheral smart card device to the
system. The pam_pkcs11 module, if configured, will attempt to access the
smart card: if the access fails, then the module returns `PAM_IGNORE`,
resulting in a possible authentication bypass.

4) Affected Distributions and Configurations
============================================

The issue was introduced in pam_pkcs11 version 0.6.12, released in July
2021. Any PAM stack that relies on pam_pkcs11 as the only
authentication factor will be affected by the issue.

On openSUSE Tumbleweed the issue became apparent only due to the
mentioned changes in GDM [7], which cause YubiKeys to be treated as
smart cards in some situations. We believe plugging in any kind of
mismatching smart card (or YubiKey) on openSUSE Tumbleweed with GDM as a
display manager will allow to bypass login.

Similar situations could occur on other Linux distributions if GDM smart
card login is enabled and smart cards are autodetected. Even then, an
affected "gdm-smartcard" PAM stack still needs to be in place for the
issue to trigger. gdm-smartcard PAM stacks relying on pam_pkcs11 are
found in the GDM repository for:

- Arch Linux [22]
- Exherbo Linux [23]
- Linux from Scratch [24]

We tried reproducing the issue on Arch Linux. There the gdm-smartcard
PAM stack is installed along with GDM, but there is no pam_pkcs11
package in the standard repositories. It can be installed from the AUR
(https://aur.archlinux.org/), however. When doing so and also installing
the gdm and ccid packages, then the issue becomes basically exploitable
as well. We only tested this with a crafted sudo PAM stack, though,
since we did not manage to get gdm into smart card authentication mode
on Arch Linux. It seems some ingredient was still missing to trigger
that.

On Arch Linux we also noticed that the AUR pam_pkcs11 package does not
place any default "pam_pkcs11.conf" file into `/etc`. This also avoids
the security problem, because when the `slot_num` [25] setting is left
unconfigured to its built-in default value of -1, then
`pam_sm_authenticate()` will return early with `PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL`.
On openSUSE we do ship a default configuration of `slot_num = 0`,
however.

Current Fedora Linux does not use pam_pkcs11 for smart card
authentication anymore (pam_sss is used instead). Older versions of
Fedora might still be affected.

5) Possible Workaround
======================

A quick workaround to prevent login bypass is to use the following PAM
stack configuration line instead of what is found e.g. in the
gdm-smartcard PAM stacks:

    auth [success=ok default=bad] pam_pkcs11.so wait_for_card card_only

Instead of using `ignore=ignore` as seen in the `required` control
setting shown in section 3), the PAM library will consider `ignore`
(actually any other outcome than success) a bad result for the
authentication stack. This will cause authentication to fail even if
pam_pkcs11 returns `PAM_IGNORE`.

6) Bugfix
=========

After extensive discussions about the nature of the problem and
potential compatibility issues, upstream arrived at a rather
straightforward bugfix which is found in commit 2ecba68d40 [26].
Basically the `PAM_IGNORE` return values have been changed into
`PAM_CRED_INSUFFICIENT` again.

This bugfix is part of upstream release 0.6.13 [5], which also fixes
another vulnerability in the PAM module, which has been discovered
independently.

7) Lessons Learned
==================

We could not find any clear advice in PAM admin or developer
documentation regarding the proper use of `PAM_IGNORE`. Therefore we try
to give an overview of the current situation and suggested best
practices in this section.

On the use of `PAM_IGNORE`
--------------------------

As there have been doubts if pam_pkcs11 is to blame for its use of
`PAM_IGNORE`, we made a survey of other PAM modules packaged in
openSUSE. We found one PAM module, pam_u2f, that also had problematic
uses of `PAM_IGNORE` in error situations and we published the issue
already in a previous report [27]. This report already resulted in a
discussion on this mailing list [28] about possible structural problems
when implementing PAM modules.

Apart from this we found the following uses of `PAM_IGNORE`:

**Core PAM Modules**

- pam_wheel: this is only kind of a filter module, such that non-`root`
  will be denied, while for `root` it returns `PAM_IGNORE`; the actual
  authentication decision is made by other modules.
- pam_sepermit: returns `PAM_IGNORE` if users are not listed in the
  configuration file.
- pam_lastlog: uses `PAM_IGNORE` if the lastlog file (in a privileged
  location) cannot be read.
- pam_userdb: returns `PAM_IGNORE` if no database is configured.
- pam_listfile: returns `PAM_IGNORE` if the user about to login does not
  match the configured criteria.

**Third Party PAM Modules**

- pam_google_authenticator: returns `PAM_IGNORE` if there is no state
  file and the `nullok` option is passed the module.
- nss-pam-ldapd: returns `PAM_IGNORE` if the user is unknown or no auth
  info is available, but only if explicitly configured to do so
  (`cfg->ignore_authinfo_unavail`, `cfg->ignore_unknown_user`)
- pam_krb5:
  - returns `PAM_IGNORE` if the user it not known, but only if
    `options->ignore_unknown_principals` is set.
  - returns `PAM_IGNORE` if a `minimum_uid` is configured and the user doesn't
    match that.
- pam_radius: returns `PAM_IGNORE` if the network is unavailable and
  ignore has been explicitly configured via the `localifdown` option.
- pam_yubico: returns `PAM_IGNORE` if there are no tokens for the user
  and the `nullok` option is passed to the module.

As can be seen from this list, most PAM modules only return `PAM_IGNORE`
if there is an explicit opt-in either through a configuration option or
a setting in a privileged configuration file. Most of the time the
meaning of the return value is that the authentication mechanism is not
configured at all, or not configured for the user that is authenticated.
Such configurations can only be used in a safe way if the module in
question is an optional authentication mechanism, and a fallback PAM
module for authentication is present on the stack.

From the issues seen in pam_pkcs11 and pam_u2f we believe it is
especially important for PAM module implementations to take care not to
use `PAM_IGNORE` in unclear error situations, since local or physically
present attackers might be able to trigger them.

On the use of `PAM_SUCCESS`
---------------------------

PAM modules that only serve utility functions but do not actually
authenticate could consider not returning `PAM_SUCCESS` but `PAM_IGNORE`
instead. This would avoid unintended successful authentication in a
situation like described in this report. It seems natural to PAM module
authors to return `PAM_SUCCESS` if nothing in their module failed,
however. A lot of modules work this way and changing them all would be a
big effort.

Conservative PAM Stack Configuration
------------------------------------

Sadly PAM can be difficult to understand for non-developers and
sometimes even for PAM module authors. Even more so admins and
integrators should be careful when writing PAM stacks, especially when
less common PAM modules are used as the only authentication requirement.
Extended PAM syntax like used in our suggested workaround could be used
in such situations for hardening purposes, to make sure no unexpected
authentication outcomes can occur.

8) Timeline
===========

2024-11-06: There was no maintainer, security contact or disclosure
  process documented in pam_pkcs11 or the OpenSC project. In an attempt to
  find a suitable upstream contact we approached Ludovic Rousseau, who was
  a contributor to pam_pkcs11 and a member of the OpenSC organization on
  GitHub.
2024-11-06: Ludovic replied that he is no longer active in the project
  and pointed to public means of reporting the issue, which we would
  rather not use at this point.
2024-11-07: We approached Paul Wolneykien, another recent pam_pkcs11
  contributor, and asked for guidance.
2024-11-07: Paul replied that Ludovic would be the proper maintainer,
  with Frank Morgner as a fallback. He also pointed to the (public) opensc
  developer mailing list.
2024-11-08: Still without a conclusive contact we publicly asked for a
  security contact [31] on the opensc developer mailing list.
2024-11-08: In response to our question, Frank Morgner of the OpenSC
  project enabled private security reporting in the pam_pkcs11 GitHub
  repository [2].
2024-11-11: We shared our report [29] using the now available GitHub
  private issue reporting, offering coordinated disclosure and an embargo
  period of up to 90 days.
2024-11-12: A couple of upstream developers joined the private GitHub
  issue and various discussions started.
2024-11-13: Due to uncertainty on the proper use of `PAM_IGNORE` and
  what the proper fix in pam_pkcs11 could be, we suggested an early
  publication of the issue to allow a public discussion of the issue.
2024-11-17: Different opinions were expressed with regards to publishing
  the issue, so no agreement could be found at this point. No planned
  release date could be established.
2024-11-20: While looking into other PAM modules and their use of
  `PAM_IGNORE`, we found that the `pam-u2f` module suffered from a similar
  problem. We reported the issue to Yubico upstream, see our earlier
  report [27].
2024-11-26: linux-pam [32] developer Dmitry V. Levin got pulled into the
  discussion to judge whether the use of `PAM_IGNORE` in pam_pkcs11 is
  problematic or not. He stated that the switch to `PAM_IGNORE` is
  problematic when end users are not aware of the behavioural change.
2024-12-05: With no clear path forward we suggested to share the report
  with the linux-distros mailing list soon to achieve some progress. No
  agreement regarding publication could be found, though.
2025-01-07: Upstream developers discussed a patch to fix the issue, but
  communication died down since December 12. We asked once more about a
  path forward to publish the report and bugfix.
2025-01-13: Upstream asked us to request a CVE for the issue. We
  requested it from Mitre, but the request got stuck [30] for nearly two
  weeks.
2025-01-14: The spin-off pam-u2f [27] issue was published. It was
  unfortunate that this got published first, since we could not publicly
  discus the bigger picture involving pam_pkcs11 at this time.
2025-01-20: An upstream developer stated that a private branch
  containing a bugfix is available, and asked whether this should be
  published. We asked not to publish anything without an agreement on the
  date and procedure.
2025-01-23: The issue with the Mitre CVE request got resolved and
  CVE-2025-24531 was assigned for it. We shared this CVE in the private
  upstream issue.
2025-01-23: We asked once more for a coordinated release date and
  suggested to share the issue with the linux-distros mailing list on Jan
  30 and to perform general publication on Feb 6.
2025-01-24: General agreement was achieved for the suggested publication
  dates.
2025-01-30: We shared the report and bugfix with the linux-distros
  mailing list [33], communicating an embargo period until publication on
  Feb 6.
2025-02-06: Upstream published bugfix release 0.6.13 [5] as planned.
