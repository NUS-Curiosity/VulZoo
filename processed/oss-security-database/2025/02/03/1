Subject: CVE-2024-27137: Apache Cassandra: unrestricted deserialization of
 JMX authentication credentials 

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Cassandra 4.0.2 before 4.0.15
- Apache Cassandra 4.1.0 before 4.1.8
- Apache Cassandra 5.0-beta1 before 5.0.3

Description:

In Apache Cassandra it is possible for a local attacker without access
 to the Apache Cassandra process or configuration files to manipulate 
the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and capture user 
names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can 
then use these credentials to access the JMX interface and perform 
unauthorized operations.


This is same vulnerability that CVE-2020-13946 was issued for, but the Java option was changed in JDK10.


This issue affects Apache Cassandra from 4.0.2 through 5.0.2 running Java 11.


Operators are recommended to upgrade to a release equal to or later than 4.0.15, 4.1.8, or 5.0.3 which fixes the issue.
