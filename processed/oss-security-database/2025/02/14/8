There is a LOW severity vulnerability affecting CPython.

There is a defect in the CPython standard library module “mimetypes” where on 
Windows the default list of known file locations are writable meaning other 
users can create invalid files to cause MemoryError to be raised on Python 
runtime startup or have file extensions be interpreted as the incorrect file type.

This defect is caused by the default locations of Linux and macOS platforms 
(such as “/etc/mime.types”) also being used on Windows, where they are 
user-writable locations (“C:\etc\mime.types”).

To work-around this issue a user can call mimetypes.init() with an empty list 
(“[]”) on Windows platforms to avoid using the default list of known file 
locations. There is no patch available yet, the CVE will be updated once there 
is a fixed version.
