Subject: CVE-2025-23195: Apache Ambari: XML External Entity (XXE)
 Vulnerability in Ambari/Oozie 

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache Ambari before 2.7.9

Description:

An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in the Ambari/Oozie 
project, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML entities. This 
vulnerability occurs due to insecure parsing of XML input using the 
`DocumentBuilderFactory` class without disabling external entity 
resolution. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary
 files on the server or perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) 
attacks. The issue has been fixed in both Ambari 2.7.9 and the trunk 
branch.
