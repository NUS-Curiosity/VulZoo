It seems strange to me to say that it is a vulnerability, for a vim
option that accepts a full-blown script to also crash when fuzzed.

It's not an attack vector to crash /bin/bash when fed a malformed
script, so why is there anything to comment on with regard to vim either?

How is this "medium" impact?
