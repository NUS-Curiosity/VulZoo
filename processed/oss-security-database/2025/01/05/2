Subject: Re: Xen Security Advisory 466 v3 (CVE-2024-53241) - Xen hypercall page unsafe against speculative attacks

Hi,

As oss-security moderator, I let this thread through up to and including
the message below, but not beyond, as further discussion went too far
into Xen development specifics.  Those interested in further replies may
see them e.g. here:
