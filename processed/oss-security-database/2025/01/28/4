Subject: CVE-2024-29869: Apache Hive: Credentials file created with non
 restrictive permissions 

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache Hive 1.1.0 before 4.0.1

Description:

Hive creates a credentials file to a temporary directory in the file system with permissions 644 by default when the file permissions are not set explicitly. Any unauthorized user having access to the directory can read the sensitive information written into this file.Â Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.1, which fixes this issue.
