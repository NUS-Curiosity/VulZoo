They've also listed on this page some unusual CVE's:

Along with the security fixes, the Node.js team has also issued CVEs for 
End-of-Life (EOL) versions of Node.js.

    - Node.js v17.x or prior CVE-2025-23087
    - Node.js v19.x CVE-2025-23088
    - Node.js v21.x CVE-2025-23089

where the CVE description is just:

   This CVE has been issued to inform users that they are using End-of-Life (EOL)
   versions of Node.js. These versions are no longer supported and do not receive
   updates, including security patches. The continued use of EOL versions may
   expose systems to potential security risks due to unaddressed software
   vulnerabilities or dependencies (CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party
   Components). Users are advised to upgrade to actively supported versions of
   Node.js to ensure continued security updates and support.

Their reasons for this are detailed on the blog post at:
https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/upcoming-cve-for-eol-versions
including getting CVE scanners to report EOL versions as vulnerable even
if no existing CVE specifically says that they are.

While I can understand their reasoning, I can just imagine the noise if
every project started issuing CVE's for every version that reaches EOL.
