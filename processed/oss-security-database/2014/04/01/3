Subject: CVE request: cacti "bug#0002405: SQL injection in graph_xport.php"

Hi all,

After seeing https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506356#c1 and 
trying (unsuccessfully) to find a CVE-2014-2327 fix, I came across this 
commit:

bug#0002405: SQL injection in graph_xport.php

  - Fixed form input validation problems
  - Fixed rrd export and graph shell escape issues

http://svn.cacti.net/viewvc/cacti/branches/0.8.8/lib/rrd.php?r1=7437&r2=7439

Can a CVE please be assigned? (I thought it may have been 
"http://svn.cacti.net/viewvc?view=rev&revision=7393 -> 
fix_quoting_in_rrd_command_CVE-2013-1435.patch -> CVE-2013-1435" from 
"[oss-security] CVE request: SQL injection and shell escaping issues in 
Cacti < 0.8.8b", but it seems like a different/new issue.)

(Have not filed a Red Hat bug)

Cheers,
