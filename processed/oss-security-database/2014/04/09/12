Subject: Heap-based buffer overflow in libdw/elfutils (CVE-2014-0172)

The compressed debug information support in libdw does not handle 
malformed compressed debug sections properly.  When computing the size 
of a memory region, integer wraparound is not taken into account, 
resulting in a heap allocation that is smaller than expected and which 
is subsequently filled with arbitrary decompressed data:

We have assigned CVE-2014-0172 to this issue.
