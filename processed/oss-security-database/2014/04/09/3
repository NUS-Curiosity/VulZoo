https://www.stunnel.org/sdf_ChangeLog.html lists:

   Version 5.01, 2014.04.08, urgency: HIGH:
     Security bugfixes
         OpenSSL DLLs updated to version 1.0.1g. This version mitigates
         TLS heartbeat read overrun (CVE-2014-0160).

but that appears be only for the precompiled Windows binaries they offer for
download, as it doesn't contain a copy of OpenSSL in the source tarballs for
Linux/UNIX distros, but instead searches for one in configure.ac.
