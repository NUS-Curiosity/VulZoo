Use CVE-2014-2828.

For reference: this was apparently disputed internally by the vendor
before a conclusion was reached that this is a vulnerability in the
context of the vendor's security policy. Obviously an attacker who
sends more authentication requests generates more system load.
Apparently the decision is that it was a mistake for
auth/controllers.py, when handling one request, to process superfluous
data that had no real purpose other than increasing resource
consumption.
