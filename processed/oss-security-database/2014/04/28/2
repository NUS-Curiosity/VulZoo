Subject: CVE-2014-0189:  /etc/sysconfig/virt-who is world-readable (contains
 unencrypted passwords)

Good morning,

Not sure if anyone else is using https://fedorahosted.org/virt-who/

It was reported that "/etc/sysconfig/virt-who" is world-readable and 
contains plaintext passwords to connect to various hypervisors. A local 
attacker could use this flaw to obtain those passwords and gain access 
to the hypervisors. (CVE-2014-0189)

Red Hat would like to thank Sal Castiglione for reporting this issue.

Discussions about fixing the issue are ongoing:
