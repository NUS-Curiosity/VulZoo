The short answer is that CVE-2013-7252 was assigned because of the
sentence "It is quite obvious that this is a programming error" in the
http://security.stackexchange.com/a/44010/32167 post. The motivation
for the CVE assignment isn't that the end result is ECB.

To try to make this slightly more general, we'll mention two scenarios
in which a vendor writes some code, and the code has a certain
characteristic for which the outcome is weaker security.

Scenario A:
Based on analysis of the code itself, one can reasonably conclude that
the vendor WAS NOT trying to have that characteristic.

Scenario B:
Based on analysis of subject-matter references, one can reasonably
conclude that the vendor SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN trying to have that
characteristic.

We've written longer explanations here in the past, but: to a
first-order approximation, CVE assignment is MOSTLY about Scenario A.

Flippant example of Scenario B: the code calls ROT13 once.

Flippant example of Scenario A: because of a logic error, the code
calls ROT13 twice.
