Subject: CVE-2014-0021: chrony traffic amplification in cmdmon protocol

With the news about the traffic amplification issue in ntpd, one of our developers looked at chronyd and it suffers from the same flaw.

We've filed a bug [1] and it's also been brought up upstream [2].  There is currently no fix, but as the ntpd issue has been gaining some interest, I'm bringing this up here now for other who may ship chrony.  We assigned it CVE-2014-0021.

Thanks.
