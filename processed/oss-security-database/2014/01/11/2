MITRE assigned CVE-2014-1402 to this yesterday:

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/71 (the report, the followup has the CVE assignment).

That means you'll need to reject this assignment; the commit that Arun spotted was due to the Debian bug report (which the git commit notes, and Ratul linked to in his initial CVE request to the list).
