Aren't the two CVE assignments correct this way as the second
temporary file creation vulnerability was introduced by the mentioned
commit?

Initially there was assigned CVE-2014-1402 for:

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/71

wich is also http://bugs.debian.org/734747 and was attempted to be
fixed with commit
https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2/commit/acb672b6a179567632e032f547582f30fa2f4aa7

But the above commit introduces a new temporary file creation
vulnerability, which then got CVE-2014-0012 assigned by Kurt.

Regards,
Salvatore
