Use CVE-2014-1475.

Use CVE-2014-1476 for the vulnerability in the Taxonomy module. The
other information seems to have at least two possible interpretations.
One interpretation is that this vulnerability in the Taxonomy module
affects whether it is safe for other modules to have these "similar
lists." A second interpretation is that "tagged with a particular
taxonomy term" means that the attack involves a crafted taxonomy term.
In this second interpretation, a custom or contributed module may
require its own vulnerability fix to block the crafted taxonomy term.
In that situation, each contributed module may require its own CVE ID,
because those issues would not be within the scope of CVE-2014-1476.

 
> 3) Security hardening (Form API - Drupal 7 - Not critical)
> To facilitate this, a new, optional 
> $form_state['programmed_bypass_access_check'] element has been added

There is no CVE for the action of adding this functionality to Drupal core.

> provides a method for custom or contributed code to fix security 
> issues that would be difficult or impossible to fix otherwise.

If contributed code uses this element to address a vulnerability, each
such vulnerability may be eligible for a CVE ID.
