Yup, was good for us too, so we could double-check that the proposed fix
from your mail is working OK for others as well, since it hasn't arrived in
the kernel.org stable-queue git yet. By the way, Ubuntu used the longer
original patch, which we used [1] in the end as well (saw too late that Linus
already committed the shorter one).

Coming back to our earlier discussion about linux-distros membership [2]:
It definitely helped being on the list. Since the patch was trivial,
we didn't suffer a significant time delay compared to other distros. In
case of more complicated patches, this could have gotten tough though
given the fact that the new builds need a significant amount of testing as
well.

It would be nice, if we (and others in a similar boat) could get a
head-start of at least a couple of days (that's how I understood your
question in [2]). Maybe a "second-class citizen" list could complement
the linux-distros list with notifications slightly earlier than on
oss-security.
