Pretty sure, yes.  I am not aware of a reason to think otherwise.

It was kindly assigned by Petr Matousek (of Red Hat, even though their
products are not affected) on Wed, 29 Jan 2014 10:01:59 +0100.

The "assigned" date seen on CVE IDs often indicates when a pool of CVE
IDs was created and then assigned to a CNA (Red Hat in this case), not
when individual CVE IDs are assigned to actual issues.  It is perfectly
normal (albeit confusing) for the "assigned" date to be earlier than the
vulnerability discovery date.  This was discussed in here before:
