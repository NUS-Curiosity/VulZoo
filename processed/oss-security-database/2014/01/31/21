I think there's some confusion here.  By "the extra day of embargo" I
was referring to the second day of the issue being known to
linux-distros and security@...nel.org, but not made public yet.  So it's
the day right before the oss-security posting.

You're probably referring to the half-day delay between the oss-security
posting and the upstream commit by Linus.

That's curious, but not surprising: I guess Ubuntu was already in the
process of testing kernels built with the longer patch when PaX Team
came up with the shorter patch.  Since either patch was considered good
enough and the proposed embargo period was very short, it made sense for
them not to restart the process.

Do you mean being on oss-security?

In this case, it was 2 days of advance notice to all on linux-distros.
I see no point in splitting this further.

OK, you have demonstrated nicely that you're able to issue advisories
and updates promptly.  Well done!

However, since you ended up updating your kernel based on which fixes
went into Ubuntu's, would you do that any quicker if you were on
linux-distros?  Ubuntu's kernel updates became available only after
public disclosure anyway.  Would you approach fixing this issue in your
kernels differently if you had advance notice (but no access to Ubuntu's
work-in-progress on their updates)?  Of course, you could, by applying
one of PaX Team's patches posted to linux-distros directly, or:

Given the specialized nature of your distro, I think it'd be best for
you to disable x32 support until you possibly include an x32 userland.

BTW, Ubuntu's advisory text (and thus also yours) is slightly wrong:

<grsecurity> Ubuntu's advisory says the vulnerability is in recvmsg.  It should say recvmmsg (newer syscall).
