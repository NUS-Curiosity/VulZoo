Here's the commit:

Ubuntu advisories and updates:

http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2096-1/
http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2095-1/
http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2094-1/

Even though the issue was easy to patch, I nevertheless find this
impressively quick for a major distro like Ubuntu, and this probably
justifies the extra day of embargo.
