At cve-assign@...re.org, we've received a number of reports that have
protocol descriptions, and ask for CVE assignments for amplification
attacks. We've declined making assignments for those. One of the
criteria we're currently using is:

  - cases in which a vendor of a UDP protocol implementation announces
    that they made a security-relevant mistake by having configuration
    or code elements that allow amplification attacks, and publishes
    a fix for this mistake

One of the other CVE Numbering Authorities was also receiving similar
reports. We coordinated with them and learned that they were looking
at CVE eligibility in much the same way.

The "in which a vendor of a UDP protocol implementation" above was
what we had for the CVE-2013-5211 ntpd issue (with some definition of
"announces"). We don't know the ultimate outcome of how amplification
attacks will interact with the scope of CVE, but we did want to point
out that this CVE-2014-0021 assignment seemed inconsistent with what
we've been doing.
