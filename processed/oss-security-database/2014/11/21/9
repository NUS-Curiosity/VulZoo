During internal discussions of this we found that alsa-lib is affected - but
with CVE-2014-7817 fix applied it's not.
mailx though is affected even with CVE-2014-7817 applied, I will post
a separate CVE request for this to oss-sec shortly (since
CVE-2014-7817 is public - someone will find out about mailx anyways,
so see no reason keeping this private anymore).

Thanks.
