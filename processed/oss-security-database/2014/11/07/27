Subject: CVE-2014-7146: MantisBT XmlImportExport plugin PHP Code Injection
 Vulnerability

Egidio "EgiX" Romano discovered a vulnerability in the MantisBT XML 
import plugin, and reserved CVE-2014-7146 for it.

This message provides details on the issue, including resolution. Kindly 
update the CVE database accordingly.

Description:

When importing data with the plugin, user input passed through the 
"description" field (and the "issuelink" attribute) of the uploaded XML 
file isn't properly sanitized before being used in a call to the 
preg_replace() function which uses the 'e' modifier. This can be 
exploited to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code when the 
Import/Export plugin is installed.

The XML Import/Export "official" plugin comes bundled with MantisBT 
releases.


Affected versions:
>= 1.2.0a3, <= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [4]

This fix is a backport of an existing commit [1] from master branch, 
which has been confirmed as addressing the issue.
