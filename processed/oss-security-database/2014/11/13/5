Subject: CVE-2014-7843 Linux kernel: aarch64: copying from /dev/zero causes
 local DoS

It was found that a read of n*PAGE_SIZE+1 from /dev/zero
will cause the kernel to panic due to an unhandled exception since it's
not handling the single byte case with a fixup (anything larger than a
single byte will properly fault.)

A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.
