Subject: Re: Fwd: [Clamav-devel] ClamAV(R) blog: ClamAV 0.98.5
 has been released!

Context:

https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=11088

I found this in 2013, made a note, forgot about it, checked it again
recently and found clamscan still crashing hence CVE-2013-6497.

I don't have any other notes I've forgotten about. I think. =)
