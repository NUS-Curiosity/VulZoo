We assume that you meant to say "Issue 17876" here.

In this case, it is acceptable to assign a different ID to reflect the
different research organizations, since there is not a new release
yet.

Use CVE-2014-9281 [sic] for the copy_field.php issue, originally
incorrectly reported for test_langs.php (bug 17876).

Continue to use CVE-2014-9271 for the file uploads issue (bug 17874).
