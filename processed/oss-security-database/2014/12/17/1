Subject: CVE request: file(1) DoS

Hi!

There are two more DoSes fixed in ELF parser of file(1), similar to the 
recent CVE-2014-8116.

1. Limit the number of ELF notes processed
Report: http://mx.gw.com/pipermail/file/2014/001653.html
Fix: 
https://github.com/file/file/commit/ce90e05774dd77d86cfc8dfa6da57b32816841c4

2. Limit string printing to 100 chars
Report: http://mx.gw.com/pipermail/file/2014/001654.html
Fix: 
https://github.com/file/file/commit/65437cee25199dbd385fb35901bc0011e164276c

Both problems amplified by the fact that the same section in ELF file 
can be referenced and processed by file(1) multiple times. This is also 
fixed in the first commit linked above.

Could CVE(s) please be assigned?
