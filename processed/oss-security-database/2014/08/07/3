Thanks Kurt, this was next on my to-do list.

Sigh. XML sucks and I somehow doubt many others are doing this right,
either. PHP + libxml makes it pretty much impossible to parse an XML file
safely. The issue was internal entity expansion (quadratic, not
exponential). Not XXE and potentially not all that bad depending on server
configuration.

Per their security advisory, Drupal submitted a CVE request for this as
well. This is actually a vulnerability in an external library (
http://scripts.incutio.com/xmlrpc/). We use the library as-is, while they
forked it. (Well, they took the class and broke it into individual
functions â€” the code was the same and our patches differed only in coding
standards.) Not sure how this should be handled.

For WordPress, this affected versions 1.5 - 3.9.1 (except 3.7.4 / 3.8.4 --
these were branch releases today in addition to 3.9.2).

This is an unsafe serialization vulnerability. Affected versions 3.9 and
3.9.1.

This is an XXE in GetID3, http://getid3.sourceforge.net/. Upstream
CVE-2014-2053.
Affected WordPress versions 3.6 - 3.9.1 (except 3.7.4 / 3.8.4)

Same reporter, same same line of code, but two separate issues here. One,
when building CSRF tokens, the individual pieces were not separated by
delimiter, so $action + $user_id could have been post_1 + user 23 or post
12 + user 3. Second issue: Nonces were not being compared in a
time-constant manner. Neither are easy to exploit.

Affected WordPress versions 2.0.3 - 3.9.1 (except 3.7.4 / 3.8.4)
