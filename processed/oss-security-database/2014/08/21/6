Subject: [OSSA 2014-028] Glance store DoS through disk space exhaustion (CVE-2014-5356)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-028
CVE: CVE-2014-5356
Date: August 21, 2014
Title: Glance store DoS through disk space exhaustion
Reporter: Thomas Leaman (HP), Stuart McLaren (HP)
Products: Glance
Versions: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2

Description:
Thomas Leaman and Stuart McLaren from Hewlett Packard reported a
vulnerability in Glance. By uploading a large enough image to a Glance
store, an authenticated user may fill the store space because the
image_size_cap configuration option is not honored. This may prevent
further image upload and/or cause service disruption. Note that the
import method is not affected. All Glance setups using API v2 are
affected (unless you use a policy to restrict/disable image upload).

Juno (development branch) fix:

Havana fix:

Notes:
This fix will be included in the Juno-3 development milestone and in
future 2013.2.4 and 2014.1.3 releases.
