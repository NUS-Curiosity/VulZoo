Subject: python-requests: CVE-2014-1829, CVE-2014-1830: password disclosure
 on redirect

FYI: a while ago python-requests 2.3.0 was released, with the following 
bugfix:

* No longer expose Authorization or Proxy-Authorization headers on 
redirect. Fix CVE-2014-1829 and CVE-2014-1830 respectively.
