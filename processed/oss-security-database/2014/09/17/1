Subject: Duplicate Request: CVE-2013-4444 as a duplicate of CVE-2013-2185

Recently Apache Tomcat issued an advisory [1] for CVE-2013-4444 [2]. However, this flaw was reported to the Apache Tomcat Security team last year. We were instructed that Apache Tomcat team did not consider this a vulnerability. Red Hat Product Security handled this issue as CVE-2013-2185 [3] in our affected products.

We request that CVE-2013-4444 be marked as a duplicate of CVE-2013-2185.
