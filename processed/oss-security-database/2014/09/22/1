As far as we can tell, CVE IDs are required for cases #1 and #3:

> 1. "used to index into a string array" possibly corresponds to
> http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/129.html for the modified
> default case after case 136, and approximately two other places in the
> patch

Use CVE-2014-7141.


> 3. added "if (preply.psize) < 0" code apparently corresponds to a more
> general issue with missing data validation

Use CVE-2014-7142.
