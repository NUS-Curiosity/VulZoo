As pointed out in this Gentoo bug, release notes for the mentioned
MySQL versions list another issue that seems to be security:

https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=518718

3) An off-by-one error related to certificate decoding in yaSSL can be
exploited to cause a buffer overflow.

There are many other issues that deserve clarification.  For example,
April CPU mentions client issue CVE-2014-2440.  Is it the same issue
that got CVE-2014-0001 publicly assigned before?  The versions that
fixed CVE-2014-2440 are the same that got CVE-2014-0001 fix, and there's
no mention of the CVE-2014-0001 in April CPU.


Actually, any CVE assigned to an open source project should have
sufficient details made available to make it possible to link it to
specific change or changes unambiguously.  Despite previous requests,
Oracle seems to refuse that even when CVEs are public.  At the same
time expecting advance notification with details.  Maybe this should be
taken into account for e.g. distros membership?
