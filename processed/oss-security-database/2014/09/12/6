I point out that said bin/g++-dep file can be found within
http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/previous_versions/ACE-6.2.7.tar.bz2.

Nevertheless, this is not a CVE request, because it is not clear to me
in what ways this file is intended for user consumption (if at all). The
issue covered by CVE-2014-6311, on the other hand, can be reproduced by
executing Debian's dpkg-buildpackage or following upstream's
documentation.
