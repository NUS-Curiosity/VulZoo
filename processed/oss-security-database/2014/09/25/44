I think it's just paranoia, it demonstrates significant enough control
over the environment that it's unlikely someone could construct it via
a naive cgi environment or similar. If someone can create variables
with an arbitrary suffix and prefix, then there are likely bigger
problems to worry about than what bash is doing. FWIW, I like
Florian's approach.
