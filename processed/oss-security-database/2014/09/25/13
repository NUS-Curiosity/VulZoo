The parser does make an effort to properly stage all operations for 
later execution, without executing them immediately.

There is certainly the question of incomplete state recovery on parse 
errors.

I've been told that there are users.  From what I can see, exported 
functions seem somewhat popular in test harnesses:

   <http://codesearch.debian.net/search?q=export\+-f>

Reportedly, some users even create the function definitions outside 
bash, so they rely function name and variable name being identical.  But 
I honestly cannot see a way to preserve such an assumption.

A subprocess flag is unlikely to be present when it is needed.  One 
common use case is to define and export functions in bash.profile, and 
expect them to exist in interactive shells created as grandchildren. 
The fix is to use bashrc instead of bash.profile and non-exported functions.

I added suffixes as well, see the attached patch.  This patch has seen 
some testing, but it certainly needs more.  There are some possibilities 
for simplification if it's acceptable to use asprintf.

What do you think about this approach?

(Chet, this patch is identical to the patch I sent to you a couple of 
minutes ago.)
