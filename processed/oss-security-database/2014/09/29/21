I've seen quite a few examples like this which don't do precisely what the submitter thought.

I hope this isn't another such example:

$ env $'BASH_FUNC_\nfoo%%=() { echo 123\n }' ./bash -c 'foo'
./bash: error importing function definition for `
foo'
123

This doesn't seem like desired behavior.

In the version before the recent patches, adding unexpected characters could cause segfaults.
