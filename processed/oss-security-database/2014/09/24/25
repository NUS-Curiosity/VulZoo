Lots of code out there uses exported functions.

There are several options for making shell functions inherited via the
environment more robust, none of them backwards compatible.  I will
choose one and implement it for a future bash version.

The leading candidates both raise the bar by requiring a potential
attacker to be able to create arbitrarily-named environment variables as
well as environment variables with specific values.

I considered (and implemented) a blacklist approach that would have
protected against a set of commonly-named variables (HTTP_*, CGI_*,
SSH_*, LC_*, and so on), but the consensus was that that was too easily
circumvented.  I removed it from the distributed patches.
