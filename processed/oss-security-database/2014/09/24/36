This brings up the question: why did someone (merely?) running a news
site receive the exact advance notification message (or a portion of
it), and when did they receive it?  I doubt a person merely running a
news site actually received advance notification in this case (I hope
not!), but I think you need to clarify this aspect.

Yes, I think including the full message in your first notification to
oss-security would have worked best.

You're right.

Thank you!
