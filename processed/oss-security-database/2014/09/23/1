Subject: CVE-2014-3653 Foreman: XSS flaw on template preview screen

Good morning,

CVE-2014-3653 was assigned to a cross-site scripting flaw in Foreman's 
template preview screen (templates are shared amongst users):

http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/7483
https://github.com/sodabrew/foreman/issues/1

No Red Hat bug yet, but it will be accessible via 
bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2014-3653 once it is filed.

Cheers,
