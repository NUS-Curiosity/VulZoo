I suggest that you use Florian's prefix-suffix convention as-is (not
necessarily the code, but same prefixes and suffixes, so that your
official change would be compatible with Florian's patch).  This is
because multiple distros have adopted Florian's patch already.  While
we'll be breaking compatibility for function exports/imports across
pre-patch and post-patch bash versions anyway, at least you can maintain
compatibility between distros' bash packages and your official releases.
