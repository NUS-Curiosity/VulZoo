I think that one CVE is for the interaction is fine.

I can give it a shot, but there's no ETA, since I have no clue how to
use exim.  I just looked at the source, and it appears to use setuid
(as opposed to setresuid) to drop privileges, and it will dlopen
user-requested libraries.

I think that the other issues in the original post may be CVE-worthy
despite their low impact -- they can, at best, cause sandbox
protection to be less effective than intended.
