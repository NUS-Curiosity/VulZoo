 loaded when entity substitution is disabled

Hi!

I can hardly call myself familiar with Java XML parsers, but here's my
2c form a quick search around this that may be wrong.  Please correct
my mistakes.

As far as I can see setExpandEntityReferences() controls what value is
set for the create-entity-ref-nodes DOM parser feature:

http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u/jaxp/file/cae04d181428/src/com/sun/org/apache/xerces/internal/jaxp/DocumentBuilderImpl.java#l158
http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u/jaxp/file/cae04d181428/src/com/sun/org/apache/xerces/internal/jaxp/DocumentBuilderImpl.java#l74
http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u/jaxp/file/cae04d181428/src/com/sun/org/apache/xerces/internal/impl/Constants.java#l427

The description in Java API docs is rather brief, xerces docs have more
details:

http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-j/features.html#create-entity-ref-nodes
http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html#dom.create-entity-ref-nodes

AFAICS, the feature does not aim to control if entity references are
expanded, but only how exactly they appear in the resulting DOM tree.

Maybe your paper should rather mention parser features as
external-general-entities and external-parameter-entities:

http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/org/xml/sax/package-summary.html#package_description

OWASP XXE document covers some of this, but actually mentions only one
of the two features...
