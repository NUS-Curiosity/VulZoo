Subject: [OSSA 2014-016] Heat template URL information leakage (CVE-2014-3801)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-016
CVE: CVE-2014-3801
Date: May 23, 2014
Title: Heat template URL information leakage
Reporter: Jason Dunsmore (Rackspace)
Products: Heat
Versions: 2013.2 to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1

Description:
Jason Dunsmore from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in Heat. An
authenticated user may temporarily see the URL of a provider template
used in another tenant by listing heat resources types. This may result
in disclosure of additional information if the template itself can be
accessed. The URL disappears from the listing after a certain point in
the stack creation. All Heat setups are affected.
