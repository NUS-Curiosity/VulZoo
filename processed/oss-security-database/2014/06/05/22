Subject: Linux kernel futex local privilege escalation (CVE-2014-3153)

Hi,

This was handled via linux-distros, hence the mandatory oss-security
posting.  The issue was made public earlier today, and is included in
this Debian advisory:

https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2014/msg00130.html

CVE-2014-3153

    Pinkie Pie discovered an issue in the futex subsystem that allows a
    local user to gain ring 0 control via the futex syscall. An
    unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel (resulting
    in denial of service) or for privilege escalation.

I've attached patches by Thomas Gleixner (four e-mails, in mbox format),
as well as back-ports of those by John Johansen of Canonical, who wrote:

For anyone who is interested I've attached back ports of the patches to

  3.13 - minor conflicts in patch 4. It has applied cleanly back to 3.2
and
  2.6.32 - conflict is in patches 3, and 4
