Subject: Re: glibc - CVE for library bug that requires application participation

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

In this type of situation, the requirement for "application
participation" does not affect whether a CVE ID can be assigned.

Without researching the POSIX standards process in detail, it seems
likely that a 29 August 2000 interpretation can reasonably be
considered required behavior for a library claiming to follow
POSIX.1-2008.

Use CVE-2014-4043.

(If it were the case that the relevant POSIX interpretation happened
last month, and a new glibc release implementing that interpretation
simply wasn't ready yet, then probably a CVE ID couldn't be assigned.
But this seems like almost 14 years.)
