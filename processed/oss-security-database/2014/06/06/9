could you please clarify whether

f0d71b3dcb8332f7971b5f2363632573e6d9486a futex: Prevent attaching to kernel threads
866293ee54227584ffcb4a42f69c1f365974ba7f futex: Add another early deadlock detection check

absolutely have to be applied as well for the CVE's to be fixed and
functionality being OK otherwise? I need to backport to 3.12.x. The patches
for 3.13 sent by Alexander applied cleanly to latest 3.12.

Thanks,

Roland
