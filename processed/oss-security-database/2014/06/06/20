Indeed. This is probably the biggest security flaw in Linux in the
past 5 years (if not the biggest ever) since it allows a full kernel
compromise even from extremely tight sandboxes. In my opinion, the way
the announcement was handled was really unprofessional. There should
have been fixes prepared for, and/or committed into the git repos for,
all currently maintained releases/branches at the time of the
announcement. Anything else leaves everybody but users of the big
mainstream distros scrambling to figure out how to get a
non-vulnerable kernel that's compatible with their current setups.
