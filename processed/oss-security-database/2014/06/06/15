Subject: CVE-2014-0085 / Zookeeper

Hi,
could some from Red Hat please clarify on 
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-0085 ?

Does this affect stock releases from http://zookeeper.apache.org/ or is this CVE for a combination
of Zookeeper and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ ?

Cheers,
        Moritz
