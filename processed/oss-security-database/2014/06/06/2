gah, that is indeed an error in the patch, but I could swear I remember
fixing this.

The corrected patch is below

Subject: [PATCH 3/4] futex: Always cleanup owner tid in unlock_pi

If the owner died bit is set at futex_unlock_pi, we currently do not
cleanup the user space futex. So the owner TID of the current owner
(the unlocker) persists. That's observable inconsistant state,
especially when the ownership of the pi state got transferred.

Clean it up unconditionally.

Backport to 2.6.32:
