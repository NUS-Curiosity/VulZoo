Are there any additional thoughts about CVE-2014-0234 before we cover
it on the cve.mitre.org web site? See:

  http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/29/4

We had planned to proceed with this viewpoint:

  1. If Red Hat shipped Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2 with a publicly
     known password in broker.conf, Red Hat is allowed to categorize
     that as a vulnerability and assign a CVE ID.

  2. There was also an issue in an example script. The script in
     question had comments of "not comprehensive nor robust enough ...
     require significant adaptations ... Please adapt it."
     Nonetheless, this is a script authored by Red Hat, and Red Hat
     might have been treating it as a supported part of a software
     product. If so, then Red Hat is allowed to categorize a script
     issue as a vulnerability and assign a CVE ID. Unless Red Hat
     chooses to take that position, the default decision for that type
     of disclaimed example code is that a CVE ID assignment isn't made.

  3. The CVE IDs in 1 and 2 can't be the same.
