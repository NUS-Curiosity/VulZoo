Subject: Re: CVE ID Request for Python CGIHTTPServer File Disclosure

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

> http://bugs.python.org/issue21766

Use CVE-2014-4650 for the "does not properly handle URL-encoded path
separators in URLs" issue, with the two impacts of "gain access to the
contents of CGI binaries or the source code of CGI scripts" and
"execute code that was not intended to be executed."

This CVE request was somewhat confusing in that it only mentioned
file disclosure, but many CVE consumers would consider the
code execution to be more important. If there is a complication --
for example, if the code execution CVE request was being handled
separately -- please let us know.
