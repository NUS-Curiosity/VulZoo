It turns out that the fix was incomplete:

https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/5429b85b9f6c2e640074176f36ff0

Upstream announcement:

https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=msg/ansible-announce/ieV1vZvcTXU/5Q93ThkY9rIJ

I think this warrants a separate CVE ID.  There is some debate whether 
this actually crosses a security boundary, but upstream thinks it does, 
after some consideration.


Note that the subsequent commit looks extremely suspicious as far as the 
sandboxing is concerned:

https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/35368e531b36c800ff6e61fc79fcd9

I'll try to figure out what's going on.
