The check_secret_key() could be problematic from a side-channel 
perspective, yes, particularly since mpi_gcd is unlikely to be hardened 
against such attacks.  It might be possible to come up with equivalent 
checks that are safer, but I'm not sure if that's worth the effort.

rsa_sign only uses the public exponent (sk.e) and the signature 
(resarr[0]).  It does leak those bits, but I'm not sure if we consider 
side-channel attacks on RSA *verification* (recovering signatures, 
document hashes, or public keysâ€”not private key material) as 
vulnerabilities.

I believe OpenSSL has a similar safety check, see RSA_eay_mod_exp() in 
crypto/rsa/rsa_eay.c.  There was some paper about it, but I think it 
involved deliberately faulty hardware, so it doesn't really count, IMHO.
