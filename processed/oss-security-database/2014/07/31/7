Interesting, thanks. So how does a reporter get hold of an embargoed CVE
number and mistakenly apply it to libressl? It seems strange to have
pulled this number out of thin air. And how long do these embargoes
last, this seems a relatively long time to be sitting on a bug which is
important enough to have been embargoed.

I await the announcement of CVE-2014-5139 with interest!
