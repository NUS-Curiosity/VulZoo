My apologies. We usually go through someone else for CVEs, and he directed us this time to contact this address. We’ll be more careful in the future.

Thanks!

Use CVE-2014-5027.

Use CVE-2014-5028.  

(Incidentally, we're not sure whether the original request sent July 21  
was within the oss-security list charter. MITRE does not control the list  
charter, but  

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security  

says "List Content Guidelines ... Public security issues only please"  
whereas the original request said "two security vulnerabilities ...  
Neither are publicly disclosed." If you want a CVE ID for an  
undisclosed vulnerability in the future -- for example, because you  
want to include the CVE ID number when the  
https://www.reviewboard.org/news/ entry first becomes public -- there  
are other options, such as sending the CVE request directly to  
cve-assign@...re.org instead.)
