No, I was just clarifying for others.  You do actually have all kernels
listed as vulnerable here:

I think the "Kernel panic - not syncing: Machine halted" is actually
unexpected.  The PoC isn't meant to crash the machine, although as we've
seen it might.  It's meant to test whether the issue is triggerable, and
if it is we should assume that a real exploit may do more (including
both DoS and privilege escalation).
