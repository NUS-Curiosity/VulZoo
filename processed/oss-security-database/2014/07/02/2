Use CVE-2014-4678 for the
https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/5429b85b9f6c2e640074176f36ff05fd5e4d1916
fix that was announced in the 2014-06-25 ansible-announce "Ansible
1.6.4 update - security release" message at
https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=ansible-announce/ieV1vZvcTXU/5Q93ThkY9rIJ

(CVE-2014-4678 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4657.)

Additional CVE IDs (at least two) will be assigned for:

A. The 2014-06-25 ansible-announce "Ansible 1.6.5 - updated security
fix" message at
https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=ansible-announce/A1px5egCnGQ/jH6f5HM7kpkJ

B. The 2014-07-01 ansible-announce "Ansible 1.6.6 - refinements to
previous security fixes" message at
https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=ansible-announce/WKL7BY3qddo/JkJiNrZzy3AJ

(At least for item B, there may have been distinct problems reported
by distinct discoverers, and per-discoverer CVE assignments may be
best if that information is available. It seems likely that that
information won't be available at the time when the CVEs are needed --
and probably individual independent researchers won't be publishing
separate advisories about subsets of the safe_eval problem -- so one
CVE ID for A and one CVE ID for B is a realistic outcome.)
