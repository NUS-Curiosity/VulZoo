Subject: [CVE-2014-3482] [CVE-2014-3483] Ruby on Rails: Two Active Record SQL
 Injection Vulnerabilities Affecting PostgreSQL

There are two distinct but related vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL
adapter for Active Record. These vulnerabilities have been assigned
the CVE identifiers CVE-2014-3482 and CVE-2014-3483.

Versions Affected:  All Versions > 2.0
Not affected:       Databases other than PostgreSQL
Fixed Versions:     3.2.19, 4.0.7 & 4.1.3

Impact
------
PostgreSQL supports a number of unique data types which are not
present in other supported databases.  A bug in the SQL quoting code
in ActiveRecord can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL using
carefully crafted values.

Only applications which query against either bitstring or range types
are vulnerable. The particular data types affected depend on the
version of Rails you're using, but the vulnerable code will look the
same.  Vulnerable code will take either take the form of:

  Model.where(bitstring: params[:some_value])
  Model.where(range: params[:from]..params[:to])

The specific versions affected is included below, however all users
running an affected release should upgrade immediately.

SQL Injection Vulnerability in 'bitstring' quoting
==================================================
Versions Affected: 2.0.0-3.2.18
Not Affected: 4.0 and Later
Identifier: CVE-2014-3482

SQL Injection Vulnerability in 'range' quoting
==============================================
Versions Affected: 4.0.0-4.1.2
Not Affected: All versions prior to 4.0.0
Identifier: CVE-2014-3483

Releases
--------
The 3.2.19, 4.0.7 & 4.1.3 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
The only feasible workaround for this issue is to not allow user
controlled values to be used in queries with the affected data types.
Given the difficulty of ensuring this, upgrading is strongly advised.

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
patches for the two supported release series and the last major
release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single
changeset.

* 4-1-postgres-sqli.patch - Patch for 4.1 series
* 4-0-postgres-sqli.patch - Patch for 4.0 series
* 3-2-postgres-sqli.patch - Patch for 3.2 series

Please note that only the 4.0.x and 4.1.x series receive regular
security updates at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases
are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we cannot guarantee the
continued availability of security fixes for earlier releases.
