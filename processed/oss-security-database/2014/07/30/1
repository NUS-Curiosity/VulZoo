Subject: CVE-2014-3120 ElasticSearch

Heads up if you are using ElasticSearch. There has been several cases where
ElasticSearch has been used in server compromise. This is the vulnerability what
they are using. I have also seen this hitting honeypots.

ElasticSearch contains a flaw that is triggered as input passed via the 'source'
parameter to /_search is not properly sanitized. This allows a remote attacker
to manipulate files and execute arbitrary commands.
