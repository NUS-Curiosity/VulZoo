Subject: Re: [ruby-core:63604] [ruby-trunk - Bug #10019] [Open] segmentation fault/buffer overrun in pack.c (encodes)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Use CVE-2014-4975 for the issue that was fixed in:

  http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=46778

This is an issue that is mentioned in:

  https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10019

but no final information is yet available about whether this is the
same as the issue specified by the Description section of Bug #10019.
At this point, it seems likely that that Description section will be
mapped to a different CVE ID for a vulnerability related to pack("m0")
calls.

Note that, within the two references above, the CVE-2014-4975 issue is
referred to by all of these terms:

  - the off-by-one issue
  - the off-by-one overflow
  - the pack.c encodes buffer overrun fixed in Revision 46778

Those three phrases above refer to the same issue.

The issue that doesn't have a CVE ID might be referred to by all of
these terms:

  - the issue from the Bug #10019 Description section
  - the issue from the reporter
  - the original Will Wood report
  - the issue reported for an AWS sample
  - the issue involving the aws-sdk gem or its dependencies
  - the issue involving pack("m0") calls

Finally, just to clarify, the issue that doesn't have a CVE ID is also
called "buffer overrun in pack.c (encodes)" but this might or might
not be the same as "the pack.c encodes buffer overrun fixed in
Revision 46778."
