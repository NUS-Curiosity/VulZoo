There already might be a confusion from how this is presented in relation to Poodle, e.g (http://marc.info/?l=openssl-dev&m=141333049205629&w=2):
"Here's a patch for the OpenSSL 1.0.1 branch that adds support for
TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, which can be used to counter the POODLE attack"

when in fact TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is a fix for downgrade dance. Additional CVE will help tracking these two issues and their fixes separately.
