Then by that measure we could for example have challenged CVE-2011-4083
for example saying that it is useful to us. The same would go for any
"unsanitized" log file submissions. I fear this is a slippery slope
where vendors can effectively game their CVE numbers with "oh we meant
to do that" which makes CVE much less useful =(
