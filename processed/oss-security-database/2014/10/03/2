Thanks Michal, good to know :)

You have a new patch (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-029), I am sure many wonders what CVE is this for? 
This looks to be related to CVE-2014-7186 ("here document" http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) but the correction is in make_cmd.c
Is this a new vulnerability?

So there isn't still any specific patch for CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278  according to your post   (http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/02/28)?

But Florian's unofficial patch or its upstream version (bash43-027 & co)  mitigates *ALL* these six so far known CVE, right?

Thanks
