To expand on the above, because the out-of-bounds access is limited to
the filed structure, the effect on message handling, etc. appears
limited to the would-be attacker's own message. Unlike the more serious
impact seen in rsyslog, my limited testing and code review suggests the
flaw, while there, has no real security impact. Nevertheless, my patch
fixes the handling of malformed PRI parts.
