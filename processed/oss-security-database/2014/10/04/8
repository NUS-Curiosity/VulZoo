 code execution through bash)

Absolutely.

Bash versions back to 1.13 are all available on ftp.gnu, so not going to
list explicit links for those.

Bash 1.12 came from an this old slackware mirror:
http://mirrors.dotsrc.org/slackware/slackware-2.0.1/slacksrc/a/bash/bash-1.12.tar.gz

Other old slackware and debian releases from the era:
http://www.nielshorn.net/slackware/slack_old.php and
http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/Debian-1.1/main/disks-i386/1996_6_16/

The atari bash 1.08 binary we used came from
http://www.umich.edu/~archive/atari/Gnustuff/Tos/Bash/Bash-108/  and was
tested in the steem engine emulator: https://code.google.com/p/steem-engine/

The Human68k bash came from
http://nfggames.com/x68000/Mirrors/Groundzero%20Organization/x68tools/gnu/bash/1.05/
and was tested using the XM6 Pro emulator:
http://mijet.eludevisibility.org/XM6%20Pro-68k/XM6%20Pro-68k.html with this
disk image to boot:
http://www.retropc.net/x68000/software/sharp/human302/index.htm
