Subject: libxml2 issue: billioun laughs variant (CVE-2014-3660)

Hi,

The Netherlands Cyber Security Center found a libxml2 issue, similar to
the original 'billion laughs' entity expansion attack. Upstream pushed out
a fix immediately (to much regret of the NCSC that wanted to do a
coordinated disclosure).
https://www.ncsc.nl/actueel/nieuwsberichten/kwetsbaarheid-ontdekt-in-libxml2.html

>From the git logs, it seems it has been fixed in libxml2 2.9.2 and is
known as CVE-2014-3660:
https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=be2a7edaf289c5da74a4f9ed3a0b6c733e775230


Kind regards,
