Subject: [OSSA 2014-033] Cinder-volume host data leak to vm instance (CVE-2014-3641)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-033
CVE: CVE-2014-3641
Date: October 02, 2014
Title: Cinder-volume host data leak to vm instance
Reporter: Duncan Thomas (HP)
Products: Cinder
Versions: up to 2014.1.2

Description:
Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Cinder
GlusterFS and Linux Smbfs drivers. By overwriting a volume from within
an instance with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may be
able to clone and attach that corrupted volume resulting in affected
drivers leaking an arbitrary file from the Cinder-volume host to the
virtual instance. Note that the host file must be readable by the Cinder
context to be exposed. Only Cinder setups using GlusterFS volume driver
configured with glusterfs_qcow2_volumes=False (which is the default) or
Cinder setups using Smbfs volume driver configured with
smbfs_default_volume_format=raw (which is not the default) are affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:

Icehouse fix:

Notes:
This fix will be included in the Juno release 2014.2 and in
the upcoming 2014.1.3 release.
