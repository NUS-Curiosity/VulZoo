Subject: [oss-security] SQL injection vulnerability in MantisBT SOAP API

Description:

Several SQL injection vulnerabilities were identified in CVE-2014-1609, and subsequently fixed in MantisBT release 1.2.16 [1].

However, it was recently discovered that the patch did not fully address the original problem in the SOAP API. Research demonstrates that using a specially crafted 'project id' parameter when calling mc_project_get_attachments(), an attacker could still perform an SQL injection.

Affected versions:
MantisBT >= 1.1.0a4, <= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Issue was discovered by
- Edwin Gozeling and Wim Visser from ITsec Security Services BV

- Paul Richards (former MantisBT developer)

Please assign a CVE ID for this issue, which is a follow-up on
CVE-2014-1609 (the released fix of which was incomplete).
