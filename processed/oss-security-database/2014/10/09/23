The PoC does pretty much the same thing as

# mount -o remount,ro TARGET

but it doesn't require privilege to run.

Due to the way that Linux handles filesystem business, it is unlikely to
work on filesystems that have anything open for writing.  (It works on
my Fedora system targetting /dev.)  The upshot is that it may be
difficult to exploit in any meaningful way on some systems.

It may also work more reliably against network filesystems.  I'm not
really sure.

That output means that you're vulnerable.  You would have gotten
something like "Permission denied" if you weren't vulnerable.
