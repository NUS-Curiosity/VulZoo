Sorry, it looks like I don't understand your question. 7.6.6 (7.6.7 today)
has no special patch file, because the version itself did receive the
necessary patches. If you'd like to see exactly which code was changed you
can also look at the totally-dead-version patches available here:
http://www.rsyslog.com/files/download/rsyslog/CVE-2014-3683-pri-vuln.tar.gz

If you prefer, I can also do a

$ git diff v7.6.5 v7.6.6

for you and post the result.
