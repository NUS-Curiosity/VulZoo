As far as we can tell, the vendor considers it a vulnerability for
unauthenticated logins as sddm to succeed, so we'll assign
CVE-2014-7271. The conditions under which this can happen are not
clear; maybe one or more of these is true:

  - sddm is a regular user account, not a uid-below-1000 account, on
    some systems because a Linux distribution is allowed to customize
    the sddm account name in its own sddm package

  - sddm is a regular user account, not a uid-below-1000 account, on
    some systems because that username was in use before sddm was
    installed

  - there's a way to choose to login as sddm even if sddm isn't on the
    list of users

Apparently the primary problem is unsafe write operations into a
directory that's completely controlled by a unprivileged user. (The
chown is, in some sense, a write operation on security-relevant file
metadata.) Use CVE-2014-7272 for all of these three.
