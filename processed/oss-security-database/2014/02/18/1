Subject: CVE request for unfixed CVE-2013-6466 in openswan-2.6.40


openswan-2.6.40 (released Feb 14) was supposed to address CVE-2013-6466 (which also affected libreswan as per CVE-2013-6467) but the fix is incomplete and
openswan can still crashed using mangled or missing IKEv2 payloads.

libreswan-3.8 that properly addressed this issue was released on January 15. Exploit code has been available as part of the libreswan test suite at
https://github.com/libreswan/libreswan/tree/master/testing/pluto/ikev2-15-fuzzer

I would like a new CVE number to track the openswan-2.6.40 vulnerability.
