As a further comment on this, Egidio Romano has pointed out that the
code execution example is not exploitable. However the file deletion
issue still is fully exploitable.
Egroupware contains lots of classes with magic methods, some of which
might be exploitable (I haven't tested them all). Therefore I am
changing this to a POSSIBLE remote code execution instead of a
definite code execution.

Thanks to Egidio for pointing it out and validating my advisory. I've
updated the advisory in the repository.

Regards,
Pedro
