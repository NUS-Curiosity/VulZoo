Thanks to everyone who explained this to me off-list.

Peter Hutterer of Red Hat has added some information about all of this 
to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1064098#c4

To summarize, what I posted here originally is 
http://trac.imagemagick.org/changeset/13736 and has been assigned 
CVE-2014-1947

The Secunia advisory (http://secunia.com/advisories/56844/) is referring 
to this commit:

http://trac.imagemagick.org/changeset/14801

Which as far as I know does not have a CVE yet.

Cheers,
