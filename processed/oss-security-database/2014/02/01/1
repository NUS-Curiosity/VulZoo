According to the Wikipedia entry on CVE (which I rewrote =):

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures#Date_Entry_Created

=======
Date Entry Created

This is the date the entry was created. Please note that for CVEs
assigned directly by Mitre this is the date Mitre created the CVE
entry. For CVEs assigned by CNAs (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle, HP, Red Hat,
etc.) this is also the date the entry was create by Mitre, not by the
CNA. So in the case where a CNA requests a block of CVE numbers in
advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks of 500) the
entry date would be when that CVE is assigned to the CNA. The CVE
itself may not be used for days, weeks, months or even possibly years
(e.g. Red Hat maintains blocks of CVEs for older security issues in
Open Source software that were not assigned a CVEs yet).
=======

So late last year I asked for and received a block of 2014 CVE's from
Mitre which we are now assigning as issues come to light. So yeah,
we're all good.
