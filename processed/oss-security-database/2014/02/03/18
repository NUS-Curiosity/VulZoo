This CVE assignment puzzles me. Relevant code was: 1) never enabled,
2) never advertised in release notes, and 3) never had a
configuration option. To enable it, a user would have to pro-actively
edit code (more than merely a configure flag). Note: I *did* read
MITRE's justification on this last point.

Also, an attacker would need to make EVP_Digest* fail. Is there
a known way to achieve this?

Finally, the NVD entry
(https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-1692)
doesn't make sense. J-PAKE experimental code wasn't in the code-base
until OpenSSH 5.2 (iirc) yet versions back to 1.2 are listed as
vulnerable. Also, a CVSS score of 7.5 (High)? I know this is 
orthogonal to the actual CVE assignment. Still...weird.

I don't have a horse in this race but the entire situation strikes
me incongruent.
