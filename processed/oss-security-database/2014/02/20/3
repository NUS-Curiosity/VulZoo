  I don't understand. How is it relevant that it was not well understood at 
the time when software was written? It is still an issue. And that argument 
could be true for many other issues. Like the JSON library example earlier 
in this thread, or

  Woh..woh..woh!!! Please note that the CVE is requested for 'New-djbdns'. 
New-djbdns is a fully fledged, production quality, fast growing fork of 
the 'djbdns'.

  New-djbdns -> http://pjp.dgplug.org/ndjbdns/

I am the upstream developer and Fedora package maintainer of this project. I 
assure you, version 1.06 is brewing and brewing good. It'll be served when it 
is ready.

I request you to kindly assign a CVE for this and the other issue in 
New-djbdns. Lot of users depend of it.

Thank you.
