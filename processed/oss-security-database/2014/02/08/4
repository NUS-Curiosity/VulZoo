 issues in Apache Cordova/PhoneGap)

Hello,

I apologize for hijacking the thread, but it seemed prudent to reply
inline with the relevant facts close by.

Is the intent here to assign CVE-2012-6636 to all issues rooted in
reliance on an incorrectly exposed Javascript bridge?

If so, please keep in mind that this issue is not as simple as
pointing at Android itself. If a vulnerable app is compiled against a
vulnerable API level of the SDK (even today) it would be vulnerable.
At least that is my current understanding. As such, additional
assignments on a per-app or per-ad-network-SDK may be necessary due to
these exposure lifetime complications.

You may have seen recently released Metasploit module that allows a
remote compromise of the Google Glass browser using an incorrectly
exposed Javascript bridge via the "searchBoxJavaBridge_" object. This
exposes an instance of android.webkit.SearchBoxImpl in older versions
of the Android browser.

If this issue should have the same CVE assignment, please ack.
Otherwise, please assign a new CVE.
