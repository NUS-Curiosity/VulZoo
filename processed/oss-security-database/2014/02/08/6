Subject: [oCERT-2014-001] MantisBT input sanitization errors


#2014-001 MantisBT input sanitization errors

Description:

The MantisBT web-based bugtracking system suffers from SQL injection
vulnerabilities caused by insufficient input sanitization.

The MantisBT SOAP API uses the unsafe db_query() function allowing a
specially crafted tag within the envelope of a mc_issue_attachment_get SOAP
request to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

The reporting of this specific issue was followed by an investigation that
lead to additional cases of unsafe db_query() function use, being found by
MantisBT maintainers, throughout MantisBT code.

Affected version:

MantisBT >= 1.1.0a4, <= 1.2.15

Fixed version:

MantisBT >= 1.2.16
