Subject: Possible CVE Requests: several issues fixed in Jenkins (Advisory
 2014-02-14)

Hi

Jenkins Advisory from 2014-02-14[1] mentions several security fixes,
where for SECURITY-76 and SECURITY-88 CVE-2013-5573 was assigned.

 [1] https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2014-02-14

Do some of the following need also a CVE assignment?

----cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut-----
SECURITY-105
| In some places, Jenkins XML API uses XStream to deserialize arbitrary
| content, which is affected by CVE-2013-7285 reported against XStream.
| This allows malicious users of Jenkins with a limited set of permissions
| to execute arbitrary code inside Jenkins master.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/d030fbbaeeb5ee8980b5680b26217930834387f4

SECURITY-76 & SECURITY-88 / CVE-2013-5573
| Restrictions of HTML tags for user-editable contents are too lax. This
| allows malicious users of Jenkins to trick other unsuspecting users into
| providing sensitive information.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/7541e83cc9812afc2b464f0a3254a2453da53f4c
https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/535c1115bbf07f8a57d509f2d00598d6e21870d4

SECURITY-109
| Plugging a hole in the earlier fix to SECURITY-55. Under some
| circimstances, a malicious user of Jenkins can configure job X to
| trigger another job Y that the user has no access to.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/b6b2a367a7976be80a799c6a49fa6c58d778b50e

SECURITY-108
| CLI job creation had a directory traversal vulnerability. This allows a
| malicious user of Jenkins with a limited set of permissions to overwrite
| files in the Jenkins master and escalate privileges.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/ad38d8480f20ce3cbf8fec3e2003bc83efda4f7d

SECURITY-106
| The embedded Winstone servlet container is susceptive to session
| hijacking attack.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/29351af4bd01f61715418916fc12c52be46bd9b0
(issue in jenkins-winstone?)

SECURITY-93
| The password input control in the password parameter definition in the
| Jenkins UI was serving the actual value of the password in HTML, not an
| encrypted one. If a sensitive value is set as the default value of such
| a parameter definition, it can be exposed to unintended audience.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/bf539198564a1108b7b71a973bf7de963a6213ef

SECURITY-89
| Deleting the user was not invalidating the API token, allowing users to
| access Jenkins when they shouldn't be allowed to do so.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/5548b5220cfd496831b5721124189ff18fbb12a3

SECURITY-80
| Jenkins UI was vulnerable to click jacking attacks.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/16931bd7bf7560e26ef98328b8e95e803d0e90f6

SECURITY-79
| "Jenkins' own user database" was revealing the presence/absence of users
| when login attempts fail.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/fbf96734470caba9364f04e0b77b0bae7293a1ec

SECURITY-77
| Jenkins had a cross-site scripting vulnerability in one of its cookies.
| If Jenkins is deployed in an environment that allows an attacker to
| override Jenkins cookies in victim's browser, this vulnerability can be
| exploited.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/a0b00508eeb74d7033dc4100eb382df4e8fa72e7

SECURITY-75
| Jenkins was vulnerable to session fixation attack. If Jenkins is
| deployed in an environment that allows an attacker to override Jenkins
| cookies in victim's browser, this vulnerability can be exploited.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/8ac74c350779921598f9d5edfed39dd35de8842a

SECURITY-74
| Stored XSS vulnerability. A malicious user of Jenkins with a certain set
| of permissions can cause Jenkins to store arbitrary HTML fragment.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/5d57c855f3147bfc5e7fda9252317b428a700014

SECURITY-73
| Some of the system diagnostic functionalities were checking a lesser
| permission than it should have. In a very limited circumstances, this
| can cause an attacker to gain information that he shouldn't have
| access to.

https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/0530a6645aac10fec005614211660e98db44b5eb

Do some of these issue need a CVE assigned?
