Use CVE-2014-2583. As usual, there are not separate CVE IDs for the
different impacts.

There is no CVE ID for the issue in which the documentation might
not be sufficient to prevent all problematic uses of pam_timestamp in
conjunction with remote services. The documentation at
http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/sag-pam_timestamp.html and
elsewhere specifically mentions "This is similar mechanism which is
used in sudo" and "FILES /var/run/sudo/..." in fairly prominent ways.
The documentation is not directly misleading, i.e., there doesn't seem
to be any implication that a remote service is a recommended use case.
