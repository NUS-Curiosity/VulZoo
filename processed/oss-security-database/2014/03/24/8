We didn't happen to notice a CVE ID of a similar bug within xen-devel.
In some cases, we would use that bug's CVE ID (if available) within a
"NOTE:" sentence at the end of a new vulnerability's CVE description.

http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2014-03/msg02707.html
says "by removing these checks we are introducing a way for a
malicious or buggy guest to trigger misbehaviour in the backend,
leading to e.g. a DoS" but we haven't tried to track down whether that
is directly applicable.
