Subject: Re: Xen Security Advisory 89 - HVMOP_set_mem_access is not preemptible

Use CVE-2014-2599.

> In 4.2 only 64-bit versions of the hypervisor are vulnerable

Typically we would not assign separate CVE IDs on the basis that
64-bit environments have different affected versions than 32-bit
environments (unless there were a separate product such as "Xen64" for
the former case).
