Subject: CVE Request/Clarification - PHP

Hello.

Two issues were recently identified as security concerns in
libmagic: CVE-2014-1943 (infinite recursion flaw) &
CVE-2014-2270 (improper bounds checking).

What is the policy regarding CVE allocation for products
vulnerable by virtue of bundling copies of vulnerable products
(as opposed to, say, linking vulnerable system libraries)?

I bring this up because PHP embeds a copy of libmagic which
it uses in its fileinfo extension. PHP has since patched its
embedded libmagic to address above-mentioned issues: [1],[2].

In the event this merits separate CVEs, please allocate.

If not, this thread can serve to clarify MITRE policy regarding
inherited vulnerabilities as well as provide a heads up for
vendors shipping PHP.

Thanks.
