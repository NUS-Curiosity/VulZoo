The scope of CVE doesn't exclude issues that exist only in software
that's at a beta level or similar level. See for example "Attendees
agreed that CVE should include problems in beta software, provided
that the beta code was intended for public dissemination" in the
http://cve.mitre.org/data/board/archives/2000-03/msg00007.html post.

The CVEs of interest to the community tend to be ones that are
"common" -- in other words, they are present at multiple sites, and a
CVE ID would actually be used (typically in multiple contexts) as the
mechanism for naming and tracking the vulnerability.

For the specific case of staging drivers, a relevant example is "this
driver is enabled in the Debian 6.0 kernel" for:

  http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/08/09/7
  http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2909

So, any background about the discovery would be helpful, e.g., is the
driver enabled in a distribution, or is someone shipping a Linux-based
appliance or device that relies on the driver. The full list is
substantial -- http://cateee.net/lkddb/web-lkddb/STAGING.html seems
relevant although that's a third-party presentation and not directly
the primary source.
