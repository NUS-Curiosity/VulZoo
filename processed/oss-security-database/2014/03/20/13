Subject: CVE request -- kernel: net: potential information leak when ubuf
 backed skbs are skb_zerocopy()ied

An information flaw was found in the way skb_zerocopy() copied skbs that
are backed by userspace buffers (for example vhost-net and recent xen
netback). Once the source skb is consumed, ubuf destructor is called and
potentially releases the corresponding userspace buffers, which can then
for example be repurposed, while the destination skb is still pointing
to the them.

This issue is similar to CVE-2014-0131.
