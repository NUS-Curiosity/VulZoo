Thanks for the CVE assignment and also for the clarification about
when a CVE might be assigned. I do not have a concrete example of such
an application, although php5 for example is embedding a copy of
libmagic/file which is used.

One question about the CVE ID, as the bug was submitted on 2013-12-20
should that have recieved a 2013 CVE?

Regards,
Salvatore
