Subject: [OSSA 2014-006] Trustee token revocation does not work with memcache
 backend (CVE-2014-2237)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-006
CVE: CVE-2014-2237
Date: March 04, 2014
Title: Trustee token revocation does not work with memcache backend
Reporter: Morgan Fainberg (Metacloud)
Products: Keystone
Versions: 2013.1 up to 2013.1.4 and 2013.2 versions up to 2013.2.2

Description:
Morgan Fainberg from Metacloud reported a vulnerability in the Keystone
memcache token backend. When a trustor issues a trust token with
impersonation enabled, the token is only added to the trustor's token
list and not to the trustee's token list. This results in the trust
token not being invalidated by the trustee's token revocation (bulk
revocation). This is most noticeable when the trustee user is disabled
or the trustee changes a password. Only setups using the memcache
backend for tokens in Keystone are affected.

Grizzly fix:

Notes:
This fix will be included in the icehouse-3 development milestone and in
future 2013.1.5 and 2013.2.3 releases.
