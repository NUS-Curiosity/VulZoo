Subject: CVE-2022-37021: Apache Geode deserialization of untrusted data
 flaw when using JMX over RMI on Java 8.  

Severity: high - possible RCE

Description:

Apache Geode versions up to 1.12.5, 1.13.4 and 1.14.0 are vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data flaw when using JMX over RMI on Java 8. 

Any user still on Java 8 who wishes to protect against deserialization attacks involving JMX or RMI should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15 and Java 11. 

If upgrading to Java 11 is not possible, then upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15 and specify "--J=-Dgeode.enableGlobalSerialFilter=true" when starting any Locators or Servers. Follow the documentation for details on specifying any user classes that may be serialized/deserialized with the "serializable-object-filter" configuration option. Using a global serial filter will impact performance.

This issue is being tracked as GEODE-9758

Mitigation:

Disable affected services such as JMX over RMI unless they are required. JMX over RMI can be disabled by setting Geode property `jmx-manager` to false; this property defaults to false on Servers and true on Locators.
