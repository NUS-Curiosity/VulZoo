Subject: CVE-2022-37023: Apache Geode deserialization of untrusted data
 flaw when using REST API on Java 8 or Java 11 

Severity: high - possible RCE

Description:

Apache Geode versions prior to 1.15.0 are vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data flaw when using REST API on Java 8 or Java 11.

Any user wishing to protect against deserialization attacks involving REST APIs should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.15 and follow the documentation for details on enabling "validate-serializable-objects=true" and specifying any user classes that may be serialized/deserialized with "serializable-object-filter". Enabling "validate-serializable-objects" may impact performance.

Mitigation:

Disable affected services such as JMX over RMI or REST APIs unless they are required. REST APIs can be disabled by setting `http-service-port` to zero.
