We (maintainers of Linux WebKit ports) don't have access to the security
issues affecting Apple products until those issues are made public by them.

So, we didn't knew until August 17th of this issue. Also you can see
that the bug report itself or the patch doesn't has any indication that
it fixes a security-related problem.

Therefore, the time it took us to notice the issue, backport the fix and
do a new release was just 7-8 days (from 17th to 24-25th of August).
Which, honestely, it is quite good taking into account that: 1)
back-porting the fix was not straightforward since it required
back-porting also a few previous patches in order to be able to merge it
properly and that 2) we are in August and people is usually on holidays.

On the other hand, I don't know if this issue was or is exploited on
Linux WebKit users. All I known is that Apple said they are aware of a
report that this issue was actively exploited (on Apple/WebKit users).
So I assume this can also affect Linux WebKit users. But I don't have a
confirmation that this is actually the case, neither I'm aware of any
PoC demonstrating the issue.

Regards.
