SECURITY-2602 / CVE-2021-43859 (upstream) & CVE-2022-0538 (Jenkins)
Jenkins 2.333 and earlier, LTS 2.319.2 and earlier is affected by the
XStream library's vulnerability CVE-2021-43859. This library is used by
Jenkins to serialize and deserialize various XML files, like global and job
`config.xml`, `build.xml`, and numerous others.

This allows attackers able to submit crafted XML files to Jenkins to be
parsed as configuration, e.g. through the `POST config.xml` API, to cause a
denial of service (DoS).
