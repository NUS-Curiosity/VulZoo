Subject: Django: CVE-2022-22818: Possible XSS via {% debug %} template tag

https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2022/feb/01/security-releases/

In accordance with `our security release policy
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/>`_, the 
Django team
is issuing
`Django 4.0.2 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/4.0.2/>`_,
`Django 3.2.12 
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/3.2.12/>`_, and
`Django 2.2.27 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/2.2.27/>`_.
These release addresses the security issues detailed below. We encourage all
users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.

CVE-2022-22818: Possible XSS via ``{% debug %}`` template tag
=============================================================

The ``{% debug %}`` template tag didn't properly encode the current context,
posing an XSS attack vector.

In order to avoid this vulnerability, ``{% debug %}`` no longer outputs an
information when the ``DEBUG`` setting is ``False``, and it ensures all 
context
variables are correctly escaped when the ``DEBUG`` setting is ``True``.

Thanks Keryn Knight for the report.

This issue has severity "medium" according to the Django security policy.
