Maybe there is a misunderstanding, just to clarify:

1. Oracle Java 15, 16, 17 and 18 are known to be affected
2. Oracle seems to be aware of this (see the various previous comments / 
the blog post linked by the OP)
3. The CVE description doesn't reflect that Java 15 and 16 is affected 
(only Java 17 and 18 is listed there as vulnerable)
4. The related entry for CVE-2022-21449 on the April 2022 CPU is also 
not reflecting this (only Java 17 and 18 is listed there as vulnerable)

and that's what is currently discussed in this thread.
