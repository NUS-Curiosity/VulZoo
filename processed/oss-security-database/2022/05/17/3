Subject: CVE-2022-26650: Apache ShenYu (incubating) Regular expression denial
 of service

Severity: moderate

Description:

In ShenYu-Bootstrap there's RegexPredicateJudge.java which uses
Pattern.matches(conditionData.getParamValue(), realData) to make
judgments, where both parameters are controllable by the user. This
can cause an attacker pass in malicious regular expressions and
characters causing a resource exhaustion.
This issue affects Apache ShenYu (incubating) 2.4.0, 2.4.1 and 2.4.2.

Mitigation:

Upgrade to Apache ShenYu (incubating) 2.4.3 or apply patch
https://github.com/apache/incubator-shenyu/pull/2975.
