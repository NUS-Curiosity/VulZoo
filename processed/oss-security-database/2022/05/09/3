Sure, you should put this address in copy when posting to oss-security 
then, so you would be sure people reply to that one too. ;)

Thanks, so you use a default env file to set the variable and allow 
people to easily change it in the case of a clustered setup. Will do so 
as well then!

Regards,
Bruno
