Thanks for confirmation!  I have merged the pull request and released 3.20.1:

    https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate/releases/tag/3.20.1

The following two commits should be cherry-picked for older releases
of logrotate (from 3.17.0 to 3.19.0):

    https://github.com/logrotate/logrotate/commit/1f76a381e2caa0603ae3dbc51ed0f1aa0d6658b9
