I saw your reveal of linux-distros from 2020 and the exchange
didn't include any text nor attachments. In that case, the
exploit should remain private to linux-distros accordingly.

How is this policy aspect enforced in the first place?
If it's not, I suggest you remove it entirely as there is no reason
to have policies which cannot (and shouldn't) be enforced.
Overall, as a researcher I would prefer having a way just to inform
distros of a bug, *without* being subject to these requirements.
