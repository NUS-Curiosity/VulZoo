Nevermind, I missunderstood the wording and the advisory just mentions
all the related CVEs correctly and made a thinko. It might turn out
that CVE-2022-23816 will not be used, but then the title would read
only as 

Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-23825,CVE-2022-29900 / XSA-407

So please disregard the question above.
