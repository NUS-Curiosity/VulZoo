Subject: CVE-2022-34169: Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an
 integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets 

Description:

The Apache Xalan Java XSLT library is vulnerable to an integer truncation issue when processing malicious XSLT stylesheets. This can be used to corrupt Java class files generated by the internal XSLTC compiler and execute arbitrary Java bytecode.

The Apache Xalan Java project is dormant and in the process of being retired. No future releases of Apache Xalan Java to address this issue are expected.

Note: Java runtimes (such as OpenJDK) include repackaged copies of Xalan.
