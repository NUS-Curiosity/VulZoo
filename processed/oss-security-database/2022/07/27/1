SECURITY-1468 / CVE-2022-36881
Git client Plugin 3.11.0 and earlier does not perform SSH host key
verification when connecting to Git repositories via SSH.

This lack of verification could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack
to intercept these connections.


SECURITY-284 / CVE-2022-36882 (CSRF) & CVE-2022-36883 (permission check) &
CVE-2022-36884 (information disclosure)
Git Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at `/git/notifyCommit` that can be
used to notify Jenkins of changes to an SCM repository. For its most basic
functionality, this endpoint receives a repository URL, and Jenkins will
schedule polling for all jobs configured with the specified repository. In
Git Plugin 4.11.3 and earlier, this endpoint can be accessed with GET
requests and without authentication.

In addition to this basic functionality, the endpoint also accept a `sha1`
parameter specifying a commit ID. If this parameter is specified, jobs
configured with the specified repo will be triggered immediately, and the
build will check out the specified commit.

Additionally, the output of the webhook endpoint will provide information
about which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs
the user has no permission to access.

This allows attackers with knowledge of Git repository URLs to trigger
builds of jobs using a specified Git repository and to cause them to check
out an attacker-specified commit, and to obtain information about the
existence of jobs configured with this Git repository.

Additionally, this webhook endpoint does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.


SECURITY-1849 / CVE-2022-36885
GitHub Plugin 1.34.4 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison
when checking whether the provided and computed webhook signatures are
equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid webhook signature.


SECURITY-2762 / CVE-2022-36886
External Monitor Job Type Plugin 191.v363d0d1efdf8 and earlier does not
require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to create runs of an external job.


SECURITY-2766 / CVE-2022-36887
Job Configuration History Plugin 1155.v28a_46a_cc06a_5 and earlier does not
require POST requests for several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to delete entries from job, agent,
and system configuration history, or restore older versions of job, agent,
and system configurations.


SECURITY-2593 / CVE-2022-36888
HashiCorp Vault Plugin 354.vdb_858fd6b_f48 and earlier does not perform
permission checks in several HTTP endpoints performing Vault connection
tests.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to obtain credentials
stored in Vault with attacker-specified path and keys.


SECURITY-2764 / CVE-2022-36889
Deployer Framework Plugin 85.v1d1888e8c021 and earlier does not restrict
the application path of the applications when configuring a deployment.

This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to upload arbitrary
files from the Jenkins controller file system to the selected service.


SECURITY-2206 / CVE-2022-36890
Deployer Framework Plugin 85.v1d1888e8c021 and earlier does not restrict
the name of files in methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to check for the existence
of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system.


SECURITY-2205 / CVE-2022-36891
Deployer Framework Plugin 85.v1d1888e8c021 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to read deployment logs.


SECURITY-2402 / CVE-2022-36892
rhnpush-plugin Plugin 0.5.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check
in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission but without Item/Workspace
or Item/Configure permission to check whether attacker-specified file
patterns match workspace contents. A sequence of requests can be used to
effectively list workspace contents.


SECURITY-2403 / CVE-2022-36893
rpmsign-plugin Plugin 0.5.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check
in a method implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Item/Read permission but without Item/Workspace
or Item/Configure permission to check whether attacker-specified file
patterns match workspace contents. A sequence of requests can be used to
effectively list workspace contents.


SECURITY-2413 / CVE-2022-36894
CLIF Performance Testing Plugin 64.vc0d66de1dfb_f and earlier allows users
to extract files from an archive without validating file paths of files
contained within the archive.

Compuware ISPW Operations Plugin 1.0.8 and earlier does not perform
permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate hosts and
ports of Compuware configurations and credentials IDs of credentials stored
in Jenkins. Those credentials IDs can be used as part of an attack to
capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

Compuware ISPW Operations Plugin defines a controller/agent message that
retrieves Java system properties.

Compuware ISPW Operations Plugin 1.0.8 and earlier does not restrict

SECURITY-2053 / CVE-2022-36901
HTTP Request Plugin 1.15 and earlier stores HTTP Request passwords
unencrypted in its global configuration file
`jenkins.plugins.http_request.HttpRequest.xml` on the Jenkins controller as
part of its configuration when using (deprecated) Basic/Digest
