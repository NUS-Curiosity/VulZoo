Subject: CVE-2022-33891: Apache Spark shell command injection vulnerability
 via Spark UI

Severity: important

Description:

The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the
configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter, this
checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify the
application. If ACLs are enabled, a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can
allow someone to perform impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name.
A malicious user might then be able to reach a permission check function
that will ultimately build a Unix shell command based on their input, and
execute it. This will result in arbitrary shell command execution as the
user Spark is currently running as. This affects Apache Spark versions
3.0.3 and earlier, versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1.

This issue is being tracked as SPARK-38992

Mitigation:

Upgrade to supported Apache Spark maintenance release 3.1.3, 3.2.2, or
3.3.0 or later
