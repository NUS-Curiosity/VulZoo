Subject: CVE-2022-42920: Apache Commons BCEL prior to 6.6.0 allows
 producing arbitrary bytecode via out-of-bounds writing 

Description:

Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow changing specific class characteristics. However, due to an out-of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. Update to Apache Commons BCEL 6.6.0.

This issue is being tracked as BCEL-363
