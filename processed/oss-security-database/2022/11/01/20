 (CVE-2022-3786)

LibreTLS does not track the OpenSSL API, so increasingly software does not build with it (it's not possible to support both LibreSSL and a supported version of OpenSSL without #ifdef hell)

Additionally, there have been breakages to LibreSSL's compatibility with OpenSSL 1.0.

As a general rule, distros don't want to package multiple OpenSSL forks because it just heavily multiplies the amount of security work necessary.
