     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-42322,CVE-2022-42323 / XSA-419
                               version 2

   Xenstore: Cooperating guests can create arbitrary numbers of nodes

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Since the fix of XSA-322 any Xenstore node owned by a removed domain
will be modified to be owned by Dom0.  This will allow two malicious
guests working together to create an arbitrary number of Xenstore
nodes.

This is possible by domain A letting domain B write into domain A's
local Xenstore tree.  Domain B can then create many nodes and reboot.
The nodes created by domain B will now be owned by Dom0.  By repeating
this process over and over again an arbitrary number of nodes can be
created, as Dom0's number of nodes isn't limited by Xenstore quota.

IMPACT
======

Two malicious guests working together can drive xenstored into an
out of memory situation, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) of
xenstored.

This inhibits creation of new guests and changing the configuration of
already running guests.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen with the fix for XSA-322 are in principle vulnerable.

Both Xenstore implementations (C and Ocaml) are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no mitigation available.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jürgen Groß of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of patches or mitigations is NOT permitted (except where
all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by
organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues
Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems
is NOT permitted.

This is because the patches will result in a guest visible change of
behavior of Xenstore.

Deployment is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
