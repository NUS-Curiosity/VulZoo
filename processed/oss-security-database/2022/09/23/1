__________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

  Due to inconsistent handling of internal URIs Squid is
  vulnerable to Exposure of Sensitive Information about clients
  using the proxy.

__________________________________________________________________

Severity:

  This problem allows a trusted client to directly access cache
  manager information bypassing the manager ACL protection.

  The available cache manager information contains records of
  internal network structure, client credentials, client identity
  and client traffic behaviour.

CVSS Score of 6.4
