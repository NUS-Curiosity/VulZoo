Operators and package maintainers who prefer to apply patches selectively can find individual vulnerability-specific patches in the "patches" subdirectory of the release directories for our stable release branches (9.16 and 9.18):

- https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.16.33/patches/
- https://downloads.isc.org/isc/bind9/9.18.7/patches/

With the public announcement of these vulnerabilities, the embargo period is ended and any updated software packages that have been prepared may be released.
