SECURITY-2868 / CVE-2022-2048
Jenkins bundles Winstone-Jetty, a wrapper around Jetty, to act as HTTP and
servlet server when started using `java -jar jenkins.war`. This is how
Jenkins is run when using any of the installers or packages, but not when
run using servlet containers such as Tomcat.

Jenkins LTS 2.346.3 and earlier, 2.362 and earlier bundle versions of Jetty
affected by the security vulnerability CVE-2022-2048. This vulnerability
allows unauthenticated attackers to make the Jenkins UI unresponsive by
exploiting Jetty's handling of invalid HTTP/2 requests, causing a denial of
service.

NOTE: This only affects instances that enable HTTP/2, typically using the
`--http2Port` argument to `java -jar jenkins.war` or corresponding options
in service configuration files. It is disabled by default in all native
installers and the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project.
