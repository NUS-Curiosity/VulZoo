Subject: CVE-2022-28893: Linux kernel: Use after free in SUNRPC subsystem

Hello, I Request a CVE from MITRE.

Description: The SUNRPC subsystem in the Linux kernel through 5.17.2 can
call xs_xprt_free before ensuring that sockets are in the intended state.
Details: Use after free happens in inet_put_port because some sockets are
not close before xs_xprt_free().
CVE-ID: CVE-2022-28893  (
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-28893)
Fix:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=1a3b1bba7c7a5eb8a11513cf88427cb9d77bc60a

------------------------------------------------------------
I followed the steps as below :

To report minor security bugs (such as local DOS or local info leak):

1、Report the bug publicly to kernel developers as described above and wait
until a fix is committed. Alternatively, you can develop and send a fix
yourself.

2、Request a CVE from MITRE through the web form. Describe the bug details
and add a link to the fix (from patchwork.kernel.org, git.kernel.org or
github.com) in the request.

3、Once a CVE is assigned, send the bug details, the CVE number and a link
to the fix to oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
