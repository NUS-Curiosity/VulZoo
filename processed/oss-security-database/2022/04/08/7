 WSA-2022-0004

The issue I described last time has come up again here [1]. 2.36.0 was
released on March 21, almost three weeks ago now, and its WSA was
released today. Why the long wait?

Three of these issues are fixed in 2.36.0 and 2.34.7, but I can't find
a release for 2.34.7 [2][3]. Is it released yet?
