 domain ID cleanup

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-26357 / XSA-399
                               version 2

                    race in VT-d domain ID cleanup

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Xen domain IDs are up to 15 bits wide.  VT-d hardware may allow for only
less than 15 bits to hold a domain ID associating a physical device with
a particular domain.  Therefore internally Xen domain IDs are mapped to
the smaller value range.  The cleaning up of the housekeeping structures
has a race, allowing for VT-d domain IDs to be leaked and flushes to be
bypassed.

IMPACT
======

The precise impact is system specific, but would typically be a Denial
of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host.  Privilege escalation and
information leaks cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions 4.11 through 4.16 are vulnerable.  Xen versions 4.10 and
earlier are not vulnerable.

Only x86 systems with VT-d IOMMU hardware are vulnerable.  Arm systems
as well as x86 systems without VT-d hardware or without any IOMMUs in
use are not vulnerable.

Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can
leverage the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests will avoid
the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are
substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on
public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.

HOWEVER, deployment of the mitigation is NOT permitted (except where
all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by
organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues
Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems
is NOT permitted.

This is because removal of pass-through devices or their replacement by
emulated devices is a guest visible configuration change, which may lead
to re-discovery of the issue.

Deployment of this mitigation is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.

AND: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
