Subject: [SECURITY] New security advisory for CVE-2022-22932

A new security advisory has been released for Apache Karaf, which was
fixed in the 4.2.15 and 4.3.6 runtime releases

CVE-2022-22932: Path traversal flaws

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: all versions of Apache Karaf prior to 4.2.15 or 4.3.6

Description:

Apache Karaf obr:* commands and run goal on the karaf-maven-plugin have partial
path traversal which allows to break out of expected folder.

The risk is low as obr:* commands are not very used and the entry is
set by user.

This has been fixed in revision:

https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.git;h=36a2bc4
https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf?p=karaf.git;h=52b70cf

Mitigation: Apache Karaf users should upgrade to 4.2.15 or 4.3.6
or later as soon as possible, or use correct path.
