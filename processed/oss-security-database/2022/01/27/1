It's not as simple as this, and also depends on a lot of factors.

If you have a graphical desktop environment installed, or a wifi card, 
you will almost certainly have policykit-1 and pkexec. If you have a 
GUI-less system it's less likely that you'll have it.

With that said, lots of different packages Recommend or Depend on 
policykit-1, including: firewalld, libvirt, NetworkManager, tuned, and 
realmd. It's also "suggested" by systemd and isc-dhcp-server, so there 
are reasons to have it even if you have nothing otherwise graphical 
installed.

It's effectively an alternative to sudo. If you have it installed and 
you try to e.g. 'systemctl restart $unit' without sudo / having a root 
shell, systemd will use polkit to try to elevate and let you do it.

Cheers,
Chris
