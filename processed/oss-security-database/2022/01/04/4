Subject: CVE-2021-40525: Apache James: Sieve file storage vulnerable to
 path traversal attacks 

Description:

Apache James ManagedSieve implementation alongside with the file storage for sieve scripts is vulnerable to path traversal, allowing reading and writing any file. This vulnerability had been patched in Apache James 3.6.1 and higher. We recommend the upgrade.


This issue is being tracked as JAMES-3646

Mitigation:

This could also be mitigated by ensuring manageSieve is disabled, which is the case by default.

Distributed and Cassandra based products are also not impacted.

The Apache James PMC would like to thanks Benoit TELLIER for the report.
