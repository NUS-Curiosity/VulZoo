Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2021-41767: Apache Guacamole: Private tunnel
 identifier may be included in the non-private details of active connections

Severity: moderate

Description:

Apache Guacamole 1.3.0 and older may incorrectly include a private
tunnel identifier in the non-private details of some REST responses.
This may allow an authenticated user who already has permission to
access a particular connection to read from or interact with another
user's active use of that same connection.
