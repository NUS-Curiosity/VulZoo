Subject: [SECURITY ADVISORY] CVE-2022-35260: .netrc parser out-of-bounds
 access (curl)

CVE-2022-35260: .netrc parser out-of-bounds access
==================================================

Project curl Security Advisory, October 26 2022 -
[Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-35260.html)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that file ends
in a line with consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curl could
read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the read works, write a
zero byte possibly beyond its boundary.

This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might
also cause different outcomes.

If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or
otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

INFO
----

The flaw was introduced in curl with [this
commit](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/eeaae10c0fb27aa06), first shipped
