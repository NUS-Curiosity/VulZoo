It is not known to be, but also not known not to be. I'm sure a
sufficiently creative attacker can convert almost any memory corruption
into arbitrary code execution, but exploit development is not my job
(I'd rather fix the vulnerabilities!), so I have not attempted to
weaponize this.

I don't maintain dbus-broker and have not tested or audited it, so
I don't know how much validation it does. I would hope that it would
detect and prevent CVE-2022-42011 and CVE-2022-42010 (which involve
invalid messages), but probably not CVE-2022-42012 (which involves a
message that is odd but technically valid).
