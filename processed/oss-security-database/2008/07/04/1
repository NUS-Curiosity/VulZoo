These are patches for a different integer overflow fixed in Pidgin 2.4.3.
So to prevent creating confusion, I'm opening the Red Hat bug that has the
patch and CVE id noted in it.  It was initially planned to not announce
these fixes in public until next week.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2008-2927

I'm also adding the upstream packagers list to the CC so they know what's
going on.

If anyone has any questions, please reply via the oss-security list.  We'll
make that the primary information source to hopefully clear things up.

Thanks.
