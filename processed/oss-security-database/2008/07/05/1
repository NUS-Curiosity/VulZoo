I just had a look at http://crisp.cs.du.edu/crisp-files/pidgin-2.0.0-upnp-limit-download.diff 
to fix CVE-2008-2957. I think the patch itself is fine 
however I am not sure if this is the right way to fix the 
issue cause I basically just workarounds the problem by 
limiting the downloads triggered by UPnP (128k) without 
giving any way to reconfigure this value or to switch it off 
completely. This may be the reason why there isn't yet an 
official patch by the pidgin people.

If you want to go with that simple workaround the patch is 
just fine.
Cheers
Nico
