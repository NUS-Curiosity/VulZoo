Applying this rule, separate id should probably be used for PyDNS [1]
[2] and adns [3] as well, at they both suffer from the similar flaws -
use predictable transactions ids and source port.

PyDNS should be fixed as of upstream version 2.3.2 [4], adns issue is
rather considered a design decision as documented in the INSTALL file
[5].
