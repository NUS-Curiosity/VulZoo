Subject: Re: [oCERT-2008-014] WordNet stack and heap overflows


Notice how CVE treats these as all the same core type of issue, even
though the types of attack vectors are different (command line vs. env
variable) and the types of buffers are different (heap vs. stack).  The
basic programming error was the same regardless of where it occurred or
what it affected.

Multiple buffer overflows in Princeton WordNet (wn) 3.0 allow
context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a long
argument on the command line; a long (2) WNSEARCHDIR, (3) WNHOME, or
(4) WNDBVERSION environment variable; or (5) a user-supplied
dictionary (aka data file).  NOTE: since WordNet itself does not run
with special privileges, this issue only crosses privilege boundaries
in cases such as when WordNet is invoked as a third party component.
