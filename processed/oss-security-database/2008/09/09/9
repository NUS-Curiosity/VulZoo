That post links to a patch file that gives a lot of clues:

http://community.mybboard.net/attachment.php?aid=10579

Looks like:


CVE-2008-3965
-------------
misc.php - SQL injection


CVE-2008-3966
-------------
usercp2.php, inc/functions_online.php,  moderation.php - XSS


CVE-2008-3967
-------------
moderation.php also has some privilege/permission checking (see
"is_moderator_by_tids")


These will be filled in later.
