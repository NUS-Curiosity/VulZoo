Subject: Re: CVE Request (gpicview)


Jan,

Are there common usage scenarios under which gpicview would receive the
filename to create from some external source, say, as a web browser
plugin?

I'm asking because the missing "ask_before_save" issues only seem like
non-security bugs - the user messing him/herself up - unless the target
file can be influenced by an external attacker.

Use CVE-2008-3791

These two might need a second CVE depending on the influence over the file
that "ask_before_save" would ask about.
