phpMyAdmin before 2.11.8 does not sufficiently prevent its pages from
using frames that point to pages in other domains, which makes it
easier for remote attackers to conduct spoofing or phishing activities
via a cross-site framing attack.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in setup.php in phpMyAdmin
before 2.11.8 allows user-assisted remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted setup arguments.  NOTE: this
issue can only be exploited in limited scenarios in which the attacker
must be able to modify config/config.inc.php.
