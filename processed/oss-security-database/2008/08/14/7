OK, some followups:

1) CVE-2008-3330.2, for Turba, affects contact.php, which only exists in
   Turba 2.2.

2) The Debian bug report seems to have found contact issues in Turba 2.1,
   in browse.php:
   http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=492578#40

3) The code from Turba 2.1 looks quite different than the contact.php code
   as quoted by Nico here:

    http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/28/3

4) I haven't seen any mention of contact issues in Horde itself, is this
   correct?

5) CVE-2008-3650, the "unspecified" issues based on a vague Horde
   Groupware advisory, appears to line up closely with both
   CVE-2008-3330.1 (obrowser) and CVE-2008-3330.2 (Turba contacts).  Is
   this sufficiently confirmed?

Difference in components is not treated as relevant for CVE purposes.

However, the different versions are.  Question 3 is especially relevant
even in this case.

This might be a candidate for a SPLIT, but I'm generally reluctant to do
so after a CVE has been published, since we don't know how many people are
already using it...
