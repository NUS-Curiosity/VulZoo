Our gnome maintainers pointed out that the patch (which was also pushed 
upstream) breaks GDM in GNOME 2.22, as can be seen in Gentoo and 
Mandriva:
  https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=235529
  https://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=43094

upstream bug:
  http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=549087

Those who did not push updates yet might want to delay this, we have 
been reverting the patch for now.
I am CC'ing oss-security, please send follow-ups to that list.
