Hi Steven!

I'll try to answer some of the questions where I can...

I guess you can safely use 6.2.429 - 6.3.059 here, as it was identified
which change introduced and which resolved the problem.

Was it?  There are very few public references of this id found by
google.  rPath link goes to their issue tracker:
  https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-2651

zipPlugin.vim only seems to be an interface to functionality
implemented in zip.vim.  Actual issues should be in zip.vim, but terms
are likely used as synonyms in the advisory.

vim-6.4.tar.bz2 does not contain zip.vim, and it is not added by
subsequent 6.4 patches ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/6.4/ , I guess
this should be 7.0+, just like tar.vim issues.

That comment was based on Jan's advisory vulnerablevim-netrw.html with
was updated to cover current state the upstream fixes, and was still
listing tar and zip as vulnerable.

Similar to CVE-2008-3074 above.

In context of GA versions, without additional patches.  I'm not sure
what is the current status wrt 7.1 official patches.  7.0 should be
first affected, all 7.0.x should be affected.

Given http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/08/12 , they
are currently split.

Probably yes, based on first affected versions.

Actually, advisory is:

1. Compression and Decompression (The ``mz'' Command)
  (which mentions mx and mz, context of mx is bit unclear)

netrw.v2 demonstrates mz flaw.

2. Copying Files (The ``mc'' Command)

demonstrated by netrw.v3

All 3 commands - mx, mz and mc are only recognized by netrw version as
bundled with 7.2 alpha.  These issues did not affect 7.1.x and previous.

mf is used in netrw.v[23] to mark files, before compress / copy is run
on them.

mf mz is command sequence executed.

It was not the purpose of netrw.v3 to demonstrate this, it just
accidentally uncovered this issue.  Taking into account which versions
are affect by this, I guess it's quite unlikely this affects anyone but
us at this point in time.

> 2) Are NETRW3-a and NETRW3-b talking about the same issue?

Probably not.  -a talks about mx and mz, but demonstrates mz.  -b is
about -mc.  Shour be different issues.

Given that it affects different plugins, separate id seems to make
sense wrt to the rules how CVE ids are usually assigned.
