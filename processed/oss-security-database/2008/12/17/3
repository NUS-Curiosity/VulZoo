The general issue of /e in preg_replace is covered by CWE-624 Executable
Regular Expression Error (http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/624.html)
which has a couple other CVE examples.

I bet there's a chunk of these in various applications.  I believe Perl
has similar functionality.

Use CVE-2008-5619 for the issue.

Note there's a separate DoS issue, CVE-2008-5620.
