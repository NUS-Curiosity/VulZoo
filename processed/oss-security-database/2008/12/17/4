Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin 2.11.x
before 2.11.9.4 and 3.x before 3.1.1.0 allows remote attackers to
perform unauthorized actions as the administrator via a link or IMG
tag to tbl_structure.php with a modified table parameter.  NOTE: this
can be leveraged to conduct SQL injection attacks and execute
arbitrary code.

attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via unknown vectors related
to the table parameter, a different vector than CVE-2008-5621.
