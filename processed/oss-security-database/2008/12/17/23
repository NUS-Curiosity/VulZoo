Subject: CVE id request: php-xajax

Hi

Steven, I am not sure, if you want to assign a new CVE id for this, but since 
we did it for several other issues where an incomplete patch was issued, I 
guess it can be done here as well.

The patch for CVE-2007-2739 seems incomplete as it doesn't escape "&".
I recommend removing the replace call and using htmlspecialchars() instead.

Also, I seem to be unable to find anything regarding CVE-2007-2740. Did anyone 
manage to find a patch or even what kind of issue we are talking about? I 
only see the XSS.

Cheers
Steffen
