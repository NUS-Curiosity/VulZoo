I mean that in 3.0.6 even Nagios server won't execute CHANGE_
commands, because the diff in the above reference stops them from
being executed.

Comment in cgi.c says:
----- function cmd_submitf
        /*
         * We disallow sending 'CHANGE' commands from the cgi's
         * until we do proper session handling to prevent cross-site
         * request forgery
         */
        if (!command || (strlen(command) > 6 && !memcmp("CHANGE", command, 6)))
                return ERROR;

So I presume that the danger comes from the CSRF.  This code was
introduced in 3.0.5.

Not in 3.0.6, see below and above.

If you're talking about the commit based on
  http://git.op5.org/git/?p=nagios.git;a=commitdiff;h=9c2a418ab4f6e4ef3a53ddcde402fe4781caa764
then I afraid that this code isn't in the 3.0.6.  Diffing 3.0.5 and
3.0.6 yeilds some improvements, the hunk that Jan mentioned (it closes
CHANGE_ commands processing by the Nagios server itself):

Yes, newlines in the comments and other places.  This is really fixed
in 3.0.5.

Yes, I meant precisely this.  But again, no real CSRF fixes are present
in 3.0.6.

I understand this.  But I feel that you think of your session tokens
work as of being committed to 3.0.6.  This seems to be wrong.

Sorry for such a long letter.
