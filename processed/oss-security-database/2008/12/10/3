Andreas, good day.

Will you be able to clarify two things.

Do you think it is really so?

CVE-2008-5028 really speaks about 3.0.5 as about vulnerable to CSRF.  At
least CHANGE_ commands were closed in 3.0.5 and were (presumably)
additionally closed at the Nagios server side in 3.0.6.  So either 3.0.6
is vulnerable too, 3.0.5 is not vulnerable to CSRF or I am missing
something.  What to choose?

Thanks!
