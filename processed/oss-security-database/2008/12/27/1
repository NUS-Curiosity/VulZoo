What about remote command execution via unsanitized user input?  It
will work only if the server had executable triggers and 'allow_exec'
is set to 1.  By the way, CVE-2008-5706 will be triggered ;)) only for
this case too.

If anyone is interested, I had reworked the original patch at MilW0rm.
Original patch was mangling results of std::string.c_str() and
sanitizing not only user-supplied part, but the whole command.  The
result is attached and comments are very welcome.
