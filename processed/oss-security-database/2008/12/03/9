Checked back with upstream, this is:
http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/xine-lib?cmd=changeset;node=18c0264660b9;style=gitweb

So no xine issue, but a libfaad one.
Referring to upstream this is a fix for 
http://caca.zoy.org/attachment/wiki/zzuf/bugs/lol-vlc.aac 
which originally was CVE-2008-4610. I have no idea nor the 
time to check the whole patch for the fix for that but I can 
confirm that it is fixed in 2.6.1, no crash here.

I contacted upstream to get more information.

Steve, could you update this CVE id?

Cheers
Nico
