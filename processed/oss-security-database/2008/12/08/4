No, CVE-2008-5028 is a different beast -- it is about cmd.cgi's command
injection via newlines.  Let me cite the commit Josh is referring to:

As you see, the wrong arguments were passed to the cmd_submitf for the
service comments -- argument 'service_desc' will be treated as integer
and argument 'presistent_comment' (that is essentially a boolean that is
simulated via 'int' type) will be treated as the pointer to a string.
SEGV is likely here.

And another issue is that newline seem to be missing from the resulting
command line that was written to the cmd file.  Can't comment on this
now, but I assume that a very long line instead of many shorter (and
proper) ones will be in the cmd file before this fix.

By the way, I think that it is wrong to cite
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4914396D.5010009%40op5.se&forum_name=nagios-devel
at the CVE-2008-5027 -- it seem to talk about the issues after 3.0.5
and command injection via cmd.cgi was already fixed, although it
introduced some regressions.
