This falls under the notion of "protection mechanism works less securely
than advertised" so is a clear case for inclusion in CVE.  Use
CVE-2008-5110.

Also - is the chdir supposed to come BEFORE or AFTER?  The CERT secure
coding rules here:

https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/cplusplus/FIO16-CPP.+Limit+access+to+files+by+creating+a+jail

suggest it might be safer AFTER, not before, due to some race condition
possibilities.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2008-5110
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5110
Reference: CONFIRM:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=505791
Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20081117 CVE Request (syslog-ng)
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/11/17/3

syslog-ng does not call chdir before it calls chroot, which might
allow attackers to escape the intended jail.  NOTE: this is only a
vulnerability when a separate vulnerability is present.
