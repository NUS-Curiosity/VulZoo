The information we had available at the time of request didn't suggest
different versions being affected.  For example, the upstream advisory
doesn't mention anything about different versions, and both Tobias Klein
advisories say "VLC media player < 0.9.6".

So at the time of assignment, Best Available Information (the cornerstone
of CVE analysis) was that they were the same type of issue affecting the
same versions.

This is becoming a big problem for us in CVE - requests to oss-security
are coming in without the kind of information that we rely on heavily to
decide when we have one CVE or multiple CVE's.  Compared to last year, the
requests are coming in when the information's less mature, *and* public.
So we wind up having to do some of the research ourselves, which slows us
down.  And as you see here, we still make mistakes.

Once the CVE's public, then it's hard to change, because we don't know who
else is using it.  In the past, if something came up during a CVE request
that triggered a split, the split could occur before the CVE ever became
public.

Anybody on this list who has suggestions for handling this, please let me
know offline.  We've only recently begun to identify the significant
impact that oss-security is having on our CVE process.  For the time
being, I'll likely be asking more questions before assigning CVE ID's.

Oh, the split... well in this case, I guess it's OK since the CVE only
just went out.  But I REALLY don't like doing this because we don't know
how many "downstream" CVE consumers are already using it, so I definitely
don't want to make a habit of it.

Stack-based buffer overflow in VideoLAN VLC media player 0.5.0 through
0.9.5 might allow user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code
via the header of an invalid CUE image file, related to
modules/access/vcd/cdrom.c.  NOTE: this identifier originally included
an issue related to RealText, but that issue has been assigned a
separate identifier, CVE-2008-5036.
