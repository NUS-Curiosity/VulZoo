By the way, I had glanced over perl from 5.8.0 to 5.8.4 (the latter were
said to be not vulnerable in the CVE-2005-0448).  But since it misses
'if $force_writeable' on the second 'chmod', it should be vulnerable to
the 'setuid' issue too.  And since there are no checks for
inode/mountpoint device changes for the directory, rmtree is called for,
I assume that it is vulnerable to the deletion issue too.

Any comments?
