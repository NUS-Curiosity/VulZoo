I treated this as two CVEs, one for the CSRF-simplifying attack, and a
separate one for the CUPS server crash (assuming that cupsd should not be
crashable by non-root authenticated users).

cupsd in CUPS before 1.3.8 allows local users, and possibly remote
attackers, to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by adding a
large number of RSS Subscriptions, which triggers a NULL pointer
dereference.  NOTE: this issue can be triggered remotely by leveraging
CVE-2008-5184.

The web interface (cgi-bin/admin.c) in CUPS before 1.3.8 uses the
guest username when a user is not logged on to the web server, which
makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended policy and
conduct CSRF attacks via the (1) add and (2) cancel RSS subscription
functions.
