Error handling in the SSH protocol in (1) SSH Tectia Client and Server
and Connector 4.0 through 4.4.11, 5.0 through 5.2.4, and 5.3 through
5.3.8; Client and Server and ConnectSecure 6.0 through 6.0.4; Server
for Linux on IBM System z 6.0.4; Server for IBM z/OS 5.5.1 and
earlier, 6.0.0, and 6.0.1; and Client 4.0-J through 4.3.3-J and 4.0-K
through 4.3.10-K; and (2) OpenSSH 4.7p1 and possibly other versions,
when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)
mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain
plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session
via unknown vectors.
