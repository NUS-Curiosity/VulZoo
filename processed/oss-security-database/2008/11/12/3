What is the relationship between this CSRF issue and the one documented
here:

  http://www.nagios.org/development/history/nagios-3x.php

  "Security fix for Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) bug reported by Tim
   Starling."

Are these the same CSRF issue, or are we talking about a separate problem
that would need a separate new CVE?
