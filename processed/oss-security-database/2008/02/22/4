Subject: CVE-2008-0416 for mozilla-firefox; details request

The CVE entry for this one is horribly obscure, and only Ubuntu has
noted it.  I don't even see it referenced in an MFSA on mozilla's site.

Kees, is this specific to 1.5.x, do you know?  Or anyone else for that
matter?  The CVE entry reads:

Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox, as used in
Ubuntu 6.06 through 7.10 and possibly other distributions, allow remote
attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via unknown
vectors related to character encoding.

Doesn't indicate a version, but Ubuntu's advisory is providing a
1.5.0.15 (pre-patch?), so I'd like to know if this affects 2.0.0.11 (and
is fixed in 2.0.0.12?), or if this is still unresolved in upstream 2.0.x
(or doesn't affect it all).

More details would be fabulous.  Thanks.
