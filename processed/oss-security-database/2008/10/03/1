Subject: CVE-2008-3833 kernel: remove SUID when splicing into an inode

This was committed in upstream kernel. I am unable to find a reference
to any discussion about this on LKML. Fixed by Mark Fasheh.

"generic_file_splice_write() does not remove S_ISUID or S_ISGID. This is
inconsistent with the way we generally write to files."

Please use CVE-2008-3833 for this vulnerability. This has similar
consequences as CVE-2008-4210.

Upstream commit: 8c34e2d63231d4bf4852bac8521883944d770fe3

Thanks, Eugene
