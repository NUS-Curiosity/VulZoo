Hi!

Just a heads up ...  In the case you distribute rpcbind using
(lib)tirpc as an RPC port mapper, you may be interested in the
CVE-2008-4619.  Some more info is in our BZ, along with Steve Dickson's
patch: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=468014

This is very likely the same issue as Solaris one, as tirpc is based on
the Sun's RPC source code, and fails in the same place.
