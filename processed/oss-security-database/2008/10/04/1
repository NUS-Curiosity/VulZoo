Subject: duplicates: CVE-2008-4406 and CVE-2008-4407 [sabre insecure temp file]

Hi

The CVE ids issued for sabre regarding the insecure use of the tmp file are 
the same. The issue was introduced by a debian patch, but other vendors might 
have possibly patched it the same way. I suggest to mark one of them as a 
duplicate though, because it might be confusing.

Cheers
Steffen
