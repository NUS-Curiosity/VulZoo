Subject: Re: gcc 4.2 optimizations and integer overflow checks


While an unusual bug, we decided to assign a CVE for it.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2008-1685
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1685
Reference: CERT-VN:VU#162289
Reference: URL:http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/162289

gcc 4.2.0 through 4.3.0 in GNU Compiler Collection, when casts are not
used, considers the sum of a pointer and an int to be greater than or
equal to the pointer, which might remove length testing code that was
intended as a protection mechanism against integer overflow and buffer
overflow attacks.
