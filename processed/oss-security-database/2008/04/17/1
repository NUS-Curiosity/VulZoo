Subject: [oCERT-2008-004] multiple speex implementations insufficient
	boundary checks


2008/04/17 #2008-004 multiple speex implementations insufficient boundary
checks

Description:

The reference speex decoder from the Speex library performs insufficient
boundary checks on a header structure read from user input, this has been
reported in oCERT-2008-002 advisory.

Further investigation showed that several packages include similar code and
are therefore vulnerable.

In order to prevent the usage of incorrect header processing reference code,
the speex_packet_to_header() function has been modified to bound the returned
mode values in Speex >= 1.2beta3.2. This change automatically fixes
applications that use the Speex library dynamically.

Affected version:

gstreamer-plugins-good <= 0.10.8
SDL_sound <= 1.0.1
Speex <= 1.1.12 (speexdec)
Sweep <= 0.9.2
vorbis-tools <= 1.2.0
VLC Media Player <= 0.8.6f
xine-lib <= 1.1.11.1
XMMS speex plugin

Fixed version:

gstreamer-plugins-good, >= 0.10.8 (patched in CVS)
SDL_sound, patched in CVS
Speex >= 1.2beta3.2 (patched in CVS)
Sweep >= 0.9.3
vorbis-tools, patched in CVS
VLC Media Player, N/A
xine-lib >= 1.1.12
XMMS speex plugin, N/A

from the Red Hat Security Response Team for his help in investigating the
issue.
