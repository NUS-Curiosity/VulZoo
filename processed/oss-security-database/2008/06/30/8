Subject: Re: patch sets for recent ruby vulnerabilities

Passing this along from the ruby developers. I asked for comments
regarding the regressions, but did not get any, but the commit to
string.c on 2008/06/22 (ie after the announcement) is probably part of
that. These commits are what I thought were the commits, but there was
so much confusion at [1] and [2] that I went straight to the developers
for confirmation.

Hope this helps.

Jamie
