I think we should encourage switching to other document formats that we
have a better handle on securing. If you do need untrusted ps, I think
treating it the same as shell script file you downloaded from the internet.

I mean, technically there's a bash restricted mode and python rexec, but
you probably wouldn't run it on random things you just downloaded.

gs -dSAFER and bash -r are useful features, but I think ever invoking them
automatically without prompts about trust, etc, is just asking for trouble.

Tavis.
