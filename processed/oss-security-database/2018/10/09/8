Surprised by this claim I did a quick check on arxiv. I don't see any
papers that are only available as postscript. All papers seem to be
available as PDF, some additionally as PS.

Which also makes sense: Many browsers support direct PDF display. While
PDF is also a complex format with pitfalls I'd still trust the
in-browser PDF readers much more than something like ghostscript.

If there are sites that rely on PS documents they should probably be
encouraged to do a server-side sandboxed auto-conversion of them and
offer PDF also.
