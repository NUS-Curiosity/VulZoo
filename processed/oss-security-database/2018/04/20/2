 Linux kernel

Hello,

It appeared that there is another reproducer for CVE-2018-1092 ("kernel:
NULL pointer dereference in ext4/mballoc.c:ext4_process_freed_data() when
mounting crafted ext4 image") which possibly affects a wider range of
systems (than a previous one):

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=199275

It was verified that a crash caused by this reproducer (88.img) is fixed
by the same upstream commit 8e4b5eae5decd.

Best regards,
