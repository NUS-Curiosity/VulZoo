Subject: CVE-2018-14055: privilege escalation in ZNC

Severity: high

Versions affected:
1.6.0 through 1.7.0
Potentially, all earlier versions too, but there is no known way to
trigger this before 1.6.0

Mitigation:
upgrade to 1.7.1

Description:
ZNC before 1.7.1-rc1 does not properly validate untrusted lines coming
from the network, allowing a non-admin user to escalate privilege,
inject rogue values into znc.conf, and gain shell access.
