Flexera helps application producers and enterprises increase application
usage and the value they derive from their software.
 
http://www.flexera.com
 
Flexera delivers market-leading Software Vulnerability Management solutions
enabling enterprises to proactively identify and remediate software
vulnerabilities, effectively reducing the risk of costly security breaches.

Flexera supports and contributes to the community in several ways. We have
always believed that reliable vulnerability intelligence and tools to aid
identifying and fixing vulnerabilities should be freely available for
consumers to ensure that users, who care about their online privacy and
security, can stay secure.
Only a few vendors address vulnerabilities in a proper way and help users
get updated and stay secure. End-users (whether private individuals or
businesses) are otherwise left largely alone, and that is why back in 2002,
Secunia Research started investigating, coordinating disclosure and
verifying software vulnerabilities.
In 2016, Secunia Research became a part of Flexera and today our in-house
software vulnerability research remains the core of the Software
Vulnerability Management products at Flexera.

The public Secunia Advisory database contains information for researchers,
security enthusiasts, and consumers to lookup individual products and
vulnerabilities and assess, whether they need to take any actions to secure
their systems or whether a given vulnerability has already been discovered
