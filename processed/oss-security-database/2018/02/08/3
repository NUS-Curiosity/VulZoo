t0 is now. Distro maintainers please use the following repo URLs:

The full git repo:

    ssh://git@...m.org/exim.git     
    tag: exim-4_90_1

The tarballs git repo:

    ssh://git@...m.org/exim-packages.git
    tag: exim-4_90_1

The tags are signed with my key¹, as are the tarballs and my own
commits.
