Subject: Exim 4.90.1 released. (Was: CVE-2018-6789 Exim 4.90 and earlier:
 buffer overflow)

We released Exim 4.90.1 just now.
---------------------------------

This is mainly a security release to fix CVE-2018-6789, a buffer
overflow in base64d(). Please update your systems to 4.90.1.  The
reporter of the bug claims to have a working exploit.  See
http://exim.org/static/doc/security/CVE-2018-6789.txt for the timeline.

This release contains some other important bug fixes since 4.90, but no
additional features. Please see the ChangeLog
ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/exim/exim4/ChangeLog

The Distros should have built packages already.

The sources can be obtained directly from the Git repos

    git://git.exim.org/exim.git     tag: exim-4_90_1
    git://git.exim.org/exim.git     tag: exim-4_90_1

The tag is signed with my GPG key¹.

Alternativly you may fetch the tarballs from the mirrors listed
on 
    https://www.exim.org/mirmon/ftp_mirrors.html

or directly from

      ftp://ftp.exim.org/pub/exim/exim4/
    https://ftp.exim.org/pub/exim/exim4/

The tarballs are signed with my GPG key¹. Next to the tarballs you will
find a sha512sum.txt, in case you are happy with simple integrity check
only.

¹) If you get a "key expired" message, please refresh my key from
the public keyservers.

Thank you for using Exim.

    Best regards from Dresden/Germany
