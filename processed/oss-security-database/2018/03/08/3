Subject: Re: memcached UDP amplification attacks

Correct, in our testing you could load up a 1MB cache value, we assume a single character key.

(5 bytes) get a = 1MB

(7 bytes) get a a = 2MB

(204 bytes) get a a … a{100x} = 100MB

When doing the initial write-up I forgot to include the magic bytes, so the actual payload is a few bytes larger than 204 bytes but the query itself is 204 bytes, this is a mistake on my part while preparing the write-up.  

We also did some testing against a memcached install to see how far we could chain/repeat keys in a single request and the cut-off was right around 100MB response using a 1MB loaded value with single character key.

Regards,
Chad

    On the other hand I think the blog is wrong. (Just reading the protocol
    specs)
    
    The default maximum size of an item is 1M, but you can easily request
    more than one item using the gets command.
       gets <key>*\r\n
    where <key>* is one or several keys separated by whitespace.
    A key is a text string that must not include control characters or
    whitespace. The maximum length of a key is 250 characters but I don't
    think there's a minimum size so one byte keys should be fine.
