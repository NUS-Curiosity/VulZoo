CVE-2018-1301: Possible out of bound access after failure in reading the HTTP request

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
httpd 2.0.1 to 2.4.29

Description:
A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to
version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by
reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not
impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is
classified as low risk for common server usage.

Mitigation:
All httpd users should upgrade to 2.4.30 or later.
