Subject: CVE-2018-1068: Linux kernel: netfilter: ebtables: CONFIG_COMPAT:
 don't trust userland offsets

hello,

(we believe this flaw is semi-public. there are posts in public mailing
lists and a commit in the upstream Linux tree, but we are not aware of this bug
being considered as a security flaw and not aware of any exploits in the wild.
so we would like to explicitly post to oss-sec@)

a CVE id of CVE-2018-1068 was assigned to this flaw and we would like to ask to
use it in the related public communications.

so:

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel implementation of 32 bit syscall interface
for bridging allowing a privileged user to arbitrarily write to a limited range
of kernel memory. This flaw can be exploited not only by a system's privileged
user (a real "root" user), but also by an attacker who is a privileged user
(a "root" user) in a user+network namespace.
