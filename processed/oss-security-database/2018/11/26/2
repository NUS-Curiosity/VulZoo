Subject: PowerDNS Security Advisory 2018-09

Hi all,

We just released PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.8, fixing a minor security issue
that we recently discovered, affecting PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.0 up
to and including 4.1.7.

The issue is that a remote attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds memory
read via a crafted query, while computing the hash of the query for a
packet cache lookup, possibly leading to a crash.

When the PowerDNS Recursor is run inside a supervisor like supervisord
or systemd, a crash will lead to an automatic restart,
limiting the impact to a somewhat degraded service.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2018-16855 by Red Hat.

The full security advisory is provided below, and can also be
found at
https://docs.powerdns.com/recursor/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2018-09.html

A minimal patch can also be found here:

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any question.

Best regards,
