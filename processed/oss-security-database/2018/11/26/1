Subject: CVE-2018-19489 QEMU: 9pfs: crash due to race condition in renaming
 files

   Hello,

A use-after-free flaw was found in the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 
9 File System(9pfs) support in QEMU. It could occur due to a race condition 
while renaming files on a shared host directory.

A user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in 
DoS issue.
