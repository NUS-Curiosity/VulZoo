Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2018-11777: Blocking local resource access in HiveServer2

CVE-2018-11777: Blocking local resource access in HiveServer2

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: This vulnerability affects all versions of Hive,
including 2.3.3, 3.1.0 and earlier

Description: Local resources on HiveServer2 machines are not properly
protected against malicious user if ranger, sentry or sql standard
authorizer is not in use.

Mitigation: It is recommended to upgrade to 2.3.4 or 3.1.1 or later if
HiveServer2 is used, and ranger, sentry or sql standard authorizer
is not in use. Admin needs to specify the following entries in
hiveserver2-site.xml:

<property>
  <name>hive.security.authorization.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>hive.security.authorization.manager</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.plugin.fallback.FallbackHiveAuthorizerFactory</value>
</property>

FallbackHiveAuthorizerFactory will do the following to mitigate above
mentioned threat:
1. Disallow local file location in sql statements except for admin
2. Allow "set" only selected whitelist parameters
3. Disallow dfs commands except for admin
4. Disallow "ADD JAR" statement
5. Disallow "COMPILE" statement
6. Disallow "TRANSFORM" statement
