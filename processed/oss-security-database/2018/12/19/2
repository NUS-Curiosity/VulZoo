Subject: CVE-2018-20216 QEMU: pvrdma: infinite loop in pvrdma_qp_send/recv

   Hello,

An infinite loop issue was found in QEMU's implementation of VMWare's 
paravirtual RDMA device. It could occur while transferring QP ring objects' 
data in pvrdma_qp_send/recv functions.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to cause infinite loop resulting in 
DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg03052.html

This issue was reported by Li Qiang.

Thank you.
