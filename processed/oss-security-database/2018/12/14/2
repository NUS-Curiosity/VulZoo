Actually, that wouldn't answer this exact question - it'd answer a
similar question about tracked vulnerabilities, and the answer would
tell us how frequently a vulnerability would need to be patched on a
system (apparently, 1/8 of the time for RHEL7 vs. latest mainline now).

We can't answer the question about untracked vulnerabilities from
per-vulnerability data because untracked implies we lack such data.
