IIUC, it's likely to corrupt adjacent stack variables and/or hit stack canary 
resulting in DoS. The scatter/gather entry object(struct ibv_sge) holds buffer 
address/length attributes used during r/w operations. If their values are 
astray, the following call to ibv_post_send() may suffer/return an error.

Thank you.
