Subject: CVE-2018-20124 QEMU: rdma: OOB access when building scatter-gather
 array

   Hello,

An out-of-bound stack buffer r/w access issue was found in QEMU's generic RDMA 
back-end implementation. It could occur when a driver tries to build 
scatter/gather element's array in build_host_sge_array() routine.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting 
in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg02822.html

This issue was reported by Saar Amar.

Thank you.
