Subject: CVE-2018-20123 QEMU: pvrdma: memory leakage in device hotplug

   Hello,

A memory leakage issue was found in the way QEMU initialised its VMWare's 
paravirtual RDMA device. In pvrdma_realize() routine, if an error occurred, it 
did not release memory resources allocated to various objects.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory, resulting in DoS 
for host.

Upstream patch:

   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2018-12/msg02817.html

This issue was reported by Li Qiang of 163.com.

Thank you.
