Subject: Re: PHP imap_open() script injection

Hi

New releases to fix this have been scheduled for tomorrow:

https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-5.6.39/NEWS#L11
https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.0.33/NEWS#L11
https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.1.25/NEWS#L21
https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.2.13/NEWS#L25
https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.3.0/NEWS#L162

Note: support for PHP 7.0 has officially ended two days ago, but the
patch is included in 7.0.33.

Quoting from UPGRADING:
"rsh/ssh logins are disabled by default. Use imap.enable_insecure_rsh if
you want to enable them. Note that the IMAP
library does not filter mailbox names before passing them to rsh/ssh
command, thus passing untrusted data to this function with rsh/ssh
enabled is insecure."

The relevant commit can be found on
https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/3a144d3f7f6bad308e2bf112ebf16829eb298f20

The assigned CVE-2018-19158 in https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77153
seems to be a typo of CVE-2018-19518.
