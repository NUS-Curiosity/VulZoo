Subject: PowerDNS Security Advisory 2018-02

Hello everybody,

We released PowerDNS Authoritative 4.1.2 yesterday, fixing a security
issue (CVE-2018-1046) affecting the dnsreplay tool included with it.
Versions of dnsreplay from 4.0.0 up to and including 4.1.1 are
vulnerable. The full security advisory can be found below and at
https://doc.powerdns.com/authoritative/security-advisories/powerdns-advisory-2018-02.html

The issue is a stack-based buffer overflow occurring when replaying a
specially crafted PCAP file with the `--ecs-stamp` option enabled,
leading to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.
Regardless of this issue, we do not advise the use of dnsreplay with
untrusted PCAP files.

The commit fixing the issue can be found here:
https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/commit/f9c57c98da1b1007a51680629b667d57d9b702b8

We would like to thank Wei Hao for finding and subsequently reporting
this issue.

Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any question.

Best regards,

Remi and the PowerDNS team
