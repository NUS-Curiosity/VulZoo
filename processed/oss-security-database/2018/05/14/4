Can you clarify what upstream considers to be the fix for this issue?
Some sources such as:

http://www.systemtek.co.uk/2018/05/apache-derby-externally-controlled-input-vulnerability-cve-2018-1313/

indicate that the fix is the change to the default security policy,
i.e. DERBY-6987.  However, the wording above seems to consider that as
more of an additional hardening fix, and the actual security fix is
change to handling of the ping command to disallow additional
arguments, i.e. DERBY-6986.

Related to the above is the question regarding the list of affected
versions.  Version 10.3.1.4 is listed as the first affected, however
the "ping with arguments" should pre-date that version, and even
DERBY-6986 indicates it's old code.  However, 10.3.1.4 seems to be the
first version to include the default security policy, which may be the
reason why it's listed as the first affected.

And one more clarification for those of us not familiar with Derby:
What is the known impact of opening some untrusted database?  Is it
known to e.g. allow arbitrary code execution directly in Derby?

Thank you!
