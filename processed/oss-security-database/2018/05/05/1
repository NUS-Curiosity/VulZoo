CVE-2018-1313: Apache Derby externally-controlled input vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Derby 10.3.1.4 to 10.14.1.0

Description:
A specially-crafted network packet can be used to request the Derby
Network Server to boot a database whose location and contents are under
the user's control. If the Derby Network Server is not running with a
Java Security Manager policy file, the attack is successful. If the
server is using a policy file, the policy file must permit the
database location to be read for the attack to work. The default
Derby Network Server policy file distributed with the affected releases
includes a permissive policy as the default Network Server policy, which
allows the attack to work.

Mitigation:
Users should specify an explicit security policy file, as described here:
http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.14/security/csecjavasecurity.html

Derby release 10.14.2.0 disallows the specially-crafted network packet,
and also modifies the default Derby Network Server policy file to be
significantly less permissive (the default file access policy is now
limited to the derby.system.home directory and the directory from
which the Derby jar files were loaded). It is still recommended that
production installations of the Derby Network Server should specify
an explicit security policy file.
