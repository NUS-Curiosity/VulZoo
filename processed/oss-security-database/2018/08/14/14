Subject: CVE-2018-5391: Linux kernel: IP fragments with random offsets allow
 a remote denial of service (FragmentSmack)

Heololo,

A flaw named FragmentSmack was found in the way the Linux kernel handled
reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to trigger time and calculation expensive fragment reassembly
algorithms by sending specially crafted packets which could lead to a CPU
saturation and hence a denial of service on the system.
