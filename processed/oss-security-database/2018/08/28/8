To be more specific here (as I complained about the other CVE report for
the kernel a minute ago), this means currently the 3.18.y, 4.4.y, and
4.9.y kernels are vulnerable to this problem.  I'll go backport the
patch above now to those trees and it will be included in the next
releases of these kernel trees later this week.

Thanks for posting this here, it is helpful, and I appreciate it.
