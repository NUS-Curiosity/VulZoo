Subject: CVE-2017-18030 Qemu: Out-of-bounds access in cirrus_invalidate_region
 routine

   Hello,

Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support is 
vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while refreshing 
vnc surface area, in case the initial pitch was negative in 
cirrus_invalidate_region.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
resulting in DoS.
