Subject: CVE-2017-15718: Apache Hadoop YARN NodeManager vulnerability

CVE-2017-15718: Apache Hadoop YARN NodeManager vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Hadoop 2.7.3, 2.7.4

Description:
In Apache Hadoop 2.7.3 and 2.7.4, the security fix for CVE-2016-3086 is incomplete.
The YARN NodeManager can leak the password for credential store provider
used by the NodeManager to YARN Applications.

If you use the CredentialProvider feature to encrypt passwords used in
NodeManager configs, it may be possible for any Container launched
by that NodeManager to gain access to the encryption password.
The other passwords themselves are not directly exposed.

Mitigation:
2.7.3 and 2.7.4 users should upgrade to 2.7.5.
If you cannot upgrade to the latest version, set the permission of
the jceks file appropriately to restrict access from unauthorized users.
