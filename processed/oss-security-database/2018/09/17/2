Subject: Re: [SECURITY] Apache SpamAssassin 3.4.2 resolves CVE-2017-15705,
 CVE-2016-1238, CVE-2018-11780 & CVE-2018-11781

Per the asf security team, mitre considers the public rc1 from a few days
ago as the start of the clock for the publishing so we were already way
past the 24 hour windiw.

Hopefully, the announcements and reports are obfuscated and bugzilla ia
private so it'll be contained.
