Subject: CVE-2018-10857 and CVE-2018-10859: git-annex private data exposure

CVE-2018-10857: Some uses of git-annex were vulnerable to a private data
exposure and exfiltration attack. It could expose the content of files
located outside the git-annex repository, or content from a private web
server on localhost or the LAN. Joey Hess discovered this attack.

CVE-2018-10859: A malicious server for a special remote could
trick git-annex into decrypting a file that was encrypted to the user's gpg
key. This attack could be used to expose encrypted data that was never
stored in git-annex. Daniel Dent discovered this attack in collaboration
with Joey Hess.

git-annex version 6.20180626 fixes these problems.
