Subject: Apache CXF 3.2.6 and 3.1.16 are released

Apache CXFâ„¢ is an open source services framework. CXF helps you build and
develop services using frontend programming APIs, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS.
These services can speak a variety of protocols such as SOAP, XML/HTTP,
RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of transports such as HTTP,
JMS or JBI.

The Apache CXF team is proud to announce the release of versions 3.2.6 and
3.1.16. Over 50 JIRA issues were fixed for 3.2.5 and 25 JIRA items were
resolved for 3.1.16.

In addition, both of these releases contain a fix for a new security
advisory:

CVE-2018-8039: Apache CXF TLS hostname verification does not work correctly
with com.sun.net.ssl.
