 Xen Security Advisory CVE-2021-28694,CVE-2021-28695,CVE-2021-28696 / XSA-378
                                   version 3

                   IOMMU page mapping issues on x86

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Warn about dom0=pvh breakage in Resolution section.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Both AMD and Intel allow ACPI tables to specify regions of memory
which should be left untranslated, which typically means these
addresses should pass the translation phase unaltered.  While these
are typically device specific ACPI properties, they can also be
specified to apply to a range of devices, or even all devices.

On all systems with such regions Xen failed to prevent guests from
undoing/replacing such mappings (CVE-2021-28694).

On AMD systems, where a discontinuous range is specified by firmware,
the supposedly-excluded middle range will also be identity-mapped
(CVE-2021-28695).

Further, on AMD systems, upon de-assigment of a physical device from a
guest, the identity mappings would be left in place, allowing a guest
continued access to ranges of memory which it shouldn't have access to
anymore (CVE-2021-28696).

IMPACT
======

The precise impact is system specific, but can - on affected systems -
be any or all of privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leaks.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

The vulnerability is only exploitable by guests granted access to
physical devices (ie, via PCI passthrough).

All versions of Xen are affected.

Only x86 systems with IOMMUs and with firmware specifying memory regions
to be identity mapped are affected.  Other x86 systems are not affected.

Whether a particular system whose ACPI tables declare such memory
region(s) is actually affected cannot be known without knowing when
and/or how these regions are used.  For example, if these regions were
used only during system boot, there would not be any vulnerability.
The necessary knowledge can only be obtained from, collectively, the
hardware and firmware manufacturers.

On Arm hardware IOMMU use is not security supported.  Accordingly, we
have not undertaken an analysis of these issues for Arm systems.

MITIGATION
==========

Not permitting untrusted guests access to phsyical devices will avoid
the vulnerability.

Likewise, limiting untrusted guest access to physical devices whose
firmware-provided ACPI tables declare identity mappings, will avoid
the vulnerability.  (Provided that there are no identity mapped
regions which are specified by the ACPI tables to apply globally.)

Note that a system is still vulnerable if a guest was trusted, while
it had such a device assigned, and then has the device removed in
anticipation of the guest becoming untrusted (because of, for example,
the insertion of an untrusted kernel module),

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.

However, these patches are known to badly break PVH dom0 support.
Work is ongoing to resolve the problem, and will be committed to the
appropriate Xen trees (including backports) when ready.  PVH dom0 has
"Technical Preview" status so we do not intend to distribute the fixes
via an update to this advisory

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
