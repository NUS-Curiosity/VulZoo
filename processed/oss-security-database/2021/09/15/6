Subject: CVE-2021-41079: Apache Tomcat DoS with unexpected TLS packet

Severity: high

Description:

Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.63, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.43 and 10.0.0-M1 to 
10.0.2 did not properly validate incoming TLS packets. When Tomcat was 
configured to use NIO+OpenSSL or NIO2+OpenSSL for TLS, a specially 
crafted packet could be used to trigger an infinite loop resulting in a 
denial of service.

Credit:

The Apache Tomcat security team would like to thank Thomas Wozenilek for 
originally reporting this issue and David Frankson of Infinite Campus 
for also providing a test case that reproduced the issue.
