Subject: CVE-2021-38555: An XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability
 exists in Apache Any23 StreamUtils.java

Severity: critical

Description:

An XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability was discovered in
the Any23 StreamUtils.java file and is known to affect Any23 versions
< 2.5. XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web
security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an
application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to
view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with
any back-end or external systems that the application itself can
access.
