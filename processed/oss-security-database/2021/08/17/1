Subject: Re: Linux kernel: nfc: null ptr dereference in llcp_sock_getname

Hi, MITRE has assigned CVE-2021-38208 to this issue,
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38208

The CVE-2021-3587 assigned by Redhat was 'RESERVED' now.
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3587

There was some confusion here, Maybe CVE-2021-3587 should be 'REJECT'.

Regards,
 butt3rflyh4ck.
