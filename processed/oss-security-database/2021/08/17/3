Hi Jeremy,

I'm sorry about the delay.  I was hoping someone else would chime in.

There's no specific requirement on the number of examples.  The above
looks reasonable to me.

I cannot speak for them, but the task does require some effort on every
issue, and perhaps the specific people are just not putting the effort.
As you can see, this was different in 2017-2019 when Gentoo had a person
actually working on this task.

Besides statistics per se, an important desirable side-effect of working
on this task is that you'd end up double-checking that every issue does
in fact get reported to oss-security.

Like he says, he'd "be a lot more comfortable if someone could provide a
stronger vouch."

However, overall I think Pop!_OS and you personally (also considering
your work on Redox OS) do meet the requirements.  So let's proceed with
the subscription.  Please e-mail me off-list with your e-mail address
and PGP key to use.  Please also confirm in this thread that we're
getting the statistics task assigned to you, and we can discuss some
specifics on what's to be done on it.

Thanks,

Alexander
