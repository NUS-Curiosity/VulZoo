Subject: CVE-2020-35519 Linux kernel: x25_bind out-of-bounds read

Hello Team,

An out-of-bounds (OOB) memory access flaw was found in x25_bind in
net/x25/af_x25.c in the Linux kernel. A bounds check failure allows a local
attacker with a user account on the system to gain access to out-of-bounds
memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information.
The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality,
integrity, as well as system availability.

'CVE-2020-35519' was assigned by Red Hat.
