Subject: CVE-2021-20257 QEMU: net: e1000: infinite loop while processing
 transmit descriptors

   Hello,

An infinite loop issue was found in the e1000 NIC emulator of the QEMU. It 
occurs while processing transmit (tx) descriptors in process_tx_desc, if 
various descriptor fields are initialised with invalid values. A guest may use 
this flaw to consume cpu cycles on the host resulting in DoS scenario.
