Subject: CVE-2021-3416 QEMU: net: infinite loop in loopback mode may lead
 tostack overflow

   Hello,

A potential stack overflow via infinite loop issue was found in various NIC 
emulators of QEMU. The said issue occurs in loopback mode of a NIC wherein 
reentrant DMA checks may get bypassed. A guest user/process may use this flaw 
to consume cpu cycles or crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS 
scenario.
