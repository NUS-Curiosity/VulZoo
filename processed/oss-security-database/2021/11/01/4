Is it intentional that (here and elsewhere in the patch) they didn't 
include all the characters with the Bidi_Control property?

    $ grep -w Bidi_Control /usr/share/unicode/PropList.txt
    061C          ; Bidi_Control # Cf       ARABIC LETTER MARK
    200E..200F    ; Bidi_Control # Cf   [2] LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK..RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK
    202A..202E    ; Bidi_Control # Cf   [5] LEFT-TO-RIGHT EMBEDDING..RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE
    2066..2069    ; Bidi_Control # Cf   [4] LEFT-TO-RIGHT ISOLATE..POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE

So U+061C, U+200E and U+200F appear to be missing from the patch.
