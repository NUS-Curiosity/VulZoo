CVE-2020-35452: mod_auth_digest possible stack overflow by one nul byte

Severity: low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.46

Description:
Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.46
A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a stack overflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of this overflow being exploitable, nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some particular compiler and/or compilation option might make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the size (a single byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow
    
Mitigation:
None

Credit:
This issue was discovered and reported by GHSL team member @antonio-morales (Antonio Morales)
