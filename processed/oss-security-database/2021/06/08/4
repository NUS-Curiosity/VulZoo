Subject: CVE-2021-33190: Apache APISIX Dashboard: Bypass network access control

Severity: important

Description:

In Apache APISIX Dashboard version 2.6, we changed the default value of
listen host to 0.0.0.0 in order to facilitate users to configure external
network access. In the IP allowed list restriction, a risky function was
used for the IP acquisition, which made it possible to bypass the network
limit. At the same time, the default account and password are
fixed.Ultimately these factors lead to the issue of security risks.  This
issue is fixed in APISIX Dashboard 2.6.1.

Mitigation:

1. Change the account password after installation, do not use the default
password.

2. Upgrade to 2.6.1 or newer.
