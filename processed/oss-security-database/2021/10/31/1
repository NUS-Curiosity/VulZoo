I did not got a reply but apparently the CVE entry got re-populated
at https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30851 and
now reads as "A memory corruption vulnerability was addressed with
improved locking. This issue is fixed in Safari 15, tvOS 15, watchOS
8, iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. Processing maliciously crafted web content
may lead to code execution."

Salvatore
