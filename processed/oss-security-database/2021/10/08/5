Thanks, but you just did that again...  For completeness, let's have the
actual content on the list, not only links to content.

That tweet above refers to "Apache httpd 2.4.50 post mortem" at:

https://github.com/icing/blog/blob/main/httpd-2.4.50.md

I'm attaching the httpd-2.4.50.md file above to this message.

This way, historians will be able to make full sense of the thread in
here even after Twitter and GitHub are gone. ;-)
