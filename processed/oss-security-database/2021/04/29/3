Subject: Re: ISC discloses three BIND vulnerabilities
 (CVE-2021-25214, CVE-2021-25215, and CVE-2021-25216)

Hi Ariande,

BIND 9.17.x was using the system SPNEGO since 9.17.2 (I think).

Also for older versions, it should be enough to use --disable-isc-spnego if you can’t patch it (that’s what I am doing for Debian buster).  It just won’t work with Heimdal krb5, but it compiles just fine with MIT krb5.

Cheers,
Ondrej

In some supported branches of Alpine, we erroneously followed a development branch of BIND, so I am trying to determine if there is anything I need to backport to cover CVE-2021-25216.
