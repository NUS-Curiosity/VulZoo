Subject: CVE-2021-3527 QEMU: usb: unbounded stack allocation in usbredir

Hello,

A flaw was found in the USB redirector device (usb-redir) of QEMU.
Small USB packets are combined into a single, large transfer request,
to reduce the overhead and improve performance. The combined size of
the bulk transfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length
array (VLA) on the stack without proper validation. Since the total
size is not bounded, a malicious guest could use this flaw to
influence the array length and cause the QEMU process to perform an
excessive allocation on the stack, resulting in a denial of service.

Note: in addition to usb-redir, the patchset below fixes other places
in the code where stack-allocated VLAs were used (notably, usb/hid and
usb/mtp).
