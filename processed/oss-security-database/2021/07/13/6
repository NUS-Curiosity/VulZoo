Subject: CVE-2021-36374: Apache Ant ZIP, and ZIP based, archive denial of
 service vulerability 

Description:

When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, or a derived formats, an Apache Ant build can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that leads to an out of memory error, even for small inputs. This can be used to disrupt builds using Apache Ant.

Apache Ant 1.9.x users should upgrade to 1.9.16 or later.
Apache Ant 1.10.x users should upgrade to 1.10.11 or later.
