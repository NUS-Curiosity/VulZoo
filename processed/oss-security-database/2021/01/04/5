Thank you for the timely reply. With regard to CVE-2020-14377, the
Scope metric was rated differently by NIST [1] hence my initial
question.

>From the problem statement above I assume all these CVEs lead to some
kind of guest-to-host compromise, which usually implies a Scope change
(or at least, this holds true for QEMU flaws). Therefore I was
wondering what's the reason behind the different evaluation of the
Scope metric between CVE-2020-14377 and the others.
