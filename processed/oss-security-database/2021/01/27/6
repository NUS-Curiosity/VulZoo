Subject: CVE-2021-26117: ActiveMQ: LDAP-Authentication does not verify
 passwords on servers with anonymous bind

Description:

The optional ActiveMQ LDAP login module can be configured to use
anonymous access to the LDAP server. In this case, for Apache ActiveMQ
Artemis prior to version 2.16.0 and Apache ActiveMQ prior to versions
5.16.1 and 5.15.14, the anonymous context is used to verify a valid
users password in error, resulting in no check on the password.


This issue is being tracked as
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-2895,
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-8035
