SECURITY-2197 / CVE-2021-21615
Due to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition, the file
browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and
`$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/` follows symbolic links to locations outside
the directory being browsed in Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2.

This allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to
control workspace contents, e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the
ability to change SCM contents, to create symbolic links that allow them to
access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser.
