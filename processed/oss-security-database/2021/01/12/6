(I was once asked if I could fix a problem without changing anything, anything at all when the fix was a one-off chmod.)   A CVE number gets attention: think of it as getting hold of the customer by the lapels and going nose-to-nose to explain in words of one syllable they if they don't update their systems that they will crash and they will get hacked.

Suppose, instead, someone comes along and sees a known, fixed bug is unfixed and uses that to trash your systems.    Or that you've got a bug that crashes the machine once a week for which there's a fix.   But, no, apparently the mythical risk of a tested update vs the actual quantifiable risk of leaving the bug unfixed is so great that they'd rather take the real, quantifiable risk.   I suppose that's understandable, after a fashion, even though actual regressions are quite rare.

The subject of this thread is a "vulnerability" that requires root to
exploit and was fixed ages ago.

If we all agree that CVEs (in the context of the kernel, not userspace)
aren't here to provide technical value but rather a marketing scheme,
maybe we should just start treating them as such?

About 95% of the commits that go in the stable tree qualify as CVEs,
maybe the path forward here is to request CVEs for a handful of those,
for each stable release and encourage customers to upgrade more often
that way?
