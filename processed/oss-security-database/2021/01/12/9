(I was once asked if I could fix a problem without changing anything, anything at all when the fix was a one-off chmod.)   A CVE number gets attention: think of it as getting hold of the customer by the lapels and going nose-to-nose to explain in words of one syllable they if they don't update their systems that they will crash and they will get hacked.

Suppose, instead, someone comes along and sees a known, fixed bug is unfixed and uses that to trash your systems.    Or that you've got a bug that crashes the machine once a week for which there's a fix.   But, no, apparently the mythical risk of a tested update vs the actual quantifiable risk of leaving the bug unfixed is so great that they'd rather take the real, quantifiable risk.   I suppose that's understandable, after a fashion, even though actual regressions are quite rare.

I didn't take a look at this specific bug very closely, but on certain
distributions (Ubuntu etc) it has been possible to get CAP_NET_ADMIN
in your own network namespace for years. An unprivileged user can
become root with all capabilities in their own user/network namespace
and modify local iptables rules. On Redhat systems you still need
root.
