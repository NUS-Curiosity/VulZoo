The CVE in question is CVE-2023-46045. MITRE still shows it as RESERVED 
but many downstream trackers already have the details.

Whether this has a security impact or not is environment specific. So 
I’m inclined to be conservative and leave it. Though the affected 
versions are wrong, which is going to impact downstream triage, so we’ll 
have to contest that.

The Graphviz project doesn’t generally request CVEs. Though sometimes 
third parties request CVEs against Graphviz. We’re usually fine with 
that; if someone wants a CVE to track, OK. These third parties rarely 
(never?) consult with us before requesting. So Graphviz commit messages 
and changelogs almost never mention CVEs, because we’re not aware of 
them at the time.
