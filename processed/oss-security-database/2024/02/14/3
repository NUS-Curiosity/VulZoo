This looks like misuse of CVE, and it only made things worse.  Now you
need not only to update the original CVE's description, but also get
this new CVE formally REJECT'ed as duplicate.  You might need assistance
from others at Apache to get this right.

Here's the previous report with CVE-2023-46104:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/19/1

Looks like the only thing that changed is "before 3.0.1" corrected to
"before 3.0.2".
