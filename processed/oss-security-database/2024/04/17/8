SECURITY-3386 / CVE-2023-48795
The CLI client (`jenkins-cli.jar`) in Jenkins 2.451 and earlier, LTS
2.440.2 and earlier bundles versions of the Apache MINA SSHD library that
are susceptible to CVE-2023-48795 (Terrapin attack). This vulnerability
allows a machine-in-the-middle attacker to reduce the security of an SSH
connection.

NOTE: This only affects the Jenkins CLI client when using the `-ssh`
connection mode, which is not the default.
