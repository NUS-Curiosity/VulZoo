I just wanted to add that in the Ubuntu Noble Numbat release we are
using AppArmor to restrict unprivileged user namespaces.Â 

Applications that don't have an AppArmor profile will use a default
profile which denies the use of capabilities within the user namespace.
Applications that need to use capabilities will have to be confined by
a profile. Since we understand that creating an AppArmor profile might
not be a trivial task for large programs, we introduced the
"unconfined" flag which makes the profile act as if it were unconfined
from the perspective of AppArmor, allowing all operations.

There are more details here:
