This Emacs commit

     2024-02-20 12:44:30 +0300 Ihor Radchenko:
     * lisp/gnus/mm-view.el (mm-display-inline-fontify): Mark contents 
untrusted.)

is not enough to fix the issue. More changes are required to make the
fix effective, namely

ccc188fcf98 2024-02-20 12:43:51 +0300 Ihor Radchenko: * lisp/files.el 
(untrusted-content): New variable.
6f9ea396f49 2024-02-20 12:47:24 +0300 Ihor Radchenko: org-latex-preview: 
Add protection when `untrusted-content' is non-nil

2024-02-20 12:47:24 +0300 Ihor Radchenko: org-latex-preview: Add 
protection when `untrusted-content' is non-nil

besides Emacs commits ccc188fcf98 and 937b9042ad7

Emacs commit 6f9ea396f49 (fix of built-in Org mode) is currently
associated with CVE-2024-30203, however Org mode commit 03635a335
is not.
