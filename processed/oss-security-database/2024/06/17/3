Subject: 	[Security-announce][CVE-2024-4032] Incorrect IPv4 and IPv6 private ranges

The “ipaddress” module contained incorrect information about whether certain IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were designated as “globally reachable” or “private”. This affected the 'is_private' and 'is_global' properties of the ipaddress.IPv4Address, ipaddress.IPv4Network, ipaddress.IPv6Address, and ipaddress.IPv6Network classes, where values wouldn’t be returned in accordance with the latest information from the IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries.

CPython 3.12.4 and 3.13.0a6 contain updated information from these registries and thus have the intended behavior.

Severity: Medium
