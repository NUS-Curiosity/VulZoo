But the scope of Red Hat's CNA explicitly includes all open source projects
included in a Red Hat product:
https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/redhat

and many projects have been told to contact Red Hat to request CVEs over
the years.   I know I've requested and received many CVE's from the
Red Hat CNA for security advisories issued by the X.Org Foundation - far
more than "on occasion".
