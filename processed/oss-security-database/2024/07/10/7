Linux 6.9.7 was released in June2024, and the patches for CVE-2024-26621 
went in months before that.  This behavior matches my 3rd bullet point 
above, so I think everything is as expected here.  ("... will randomize 
the load address of large libraries loaded by 32-bit apps.")

If you want to see the lack of randomization, try the test with an x86 
kernel, not amd64.
