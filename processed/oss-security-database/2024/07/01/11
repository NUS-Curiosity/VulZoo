Subject: CVE-2024-39573: Apache HTTP Server: mod_rewrite proxy handler
 substitution 

Severity: moderate

Affected versions:

- Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 through 2.4.59

Description:

Potential SSRF in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to cause unsafe RewriteRules to unexpectedly setup URL's to be handled by mod_proxy.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.
