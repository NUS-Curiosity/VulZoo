Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Apache CloudStack CVE-2024-41107: SAML Signature Exclusion

Apache CloudStack project announces the release of LTS releases 4.19.1.0
and 4.18.2.2 that addresses CVE-2024-41107 that affects CloudStack SAML
users, of severity 'important' explained below.

# CVE-2024-41107: SAML Signature Exclusion

The CloudStack SAML authentication (disabled by default) does not enforce
signature check. In CloudStack environments where SAML authentication is
enabled, an attacker that initiates CloudStack SAML single sign-on
authentication can bypass SAML authentication by submitting a spoofed SAML
response with no signature and known or guessed username and other user
details of a SAML-enabled CloudStack user-account. In such environments,
this can result in a complete compromise of the resources owned and/or
accessible by a SAML enabled user-account.

# Credits

The original issue was reported by Christian Gross of Netcloud AG who filed

# Resolution
