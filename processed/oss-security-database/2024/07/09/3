Subject: Django CVE-2024-38875, CVE-2024-39329, CVE-2024-39330, and CVE-2024-39614

From: https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2024/jul/09/security-releases/

In accordance with `our security release policy
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/security/>`_, the Django
team
is issuing releases for
`Django 5.0.7 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/5.0.7/>`_ and
`Django 4.2.14 <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/4.2.14/>`_.
These releases address the security issues detailed below. We encourage all
users of Django to upgrade as soon as possible.

CVE-2024-38875: Potential denial-of-service in django.utils.html.urlize()
=========================================================================

``urlize()`` and ``urlizetrunc()`` were subject to a potential
denial-of-service
attack via certain inputs with a very large number of brackets.

Thanks to Elias Myllym√§ki for the report.

This issue has severity "moderate" according to the Django security policy.

CVE-2024-39329: Username enumeration through timing difference for users
with unusable passwords
================================================================================================

The ``django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend.authenticate()`` method
allowed remote attackers to enumerate users via a timing attack involving
login
requests for users with unusable passwords.

This issue has severity "low" according to the Django security policy.

CVE-2024-39330: Potential directory-traversal in
django.core.files.storage.Storage.save()
=========================================================================================

Derived classes of the ``django.core.files.storage.Storage`` base class
which
override ``generate_filename()`` without replicating the file path
validations
existing in the parent class, allowed for potential directory-traversal via
certain inputs when calling ``save()``.

Built-in ``Storage`` sub-classes were not affected by this vulnerability.

Thanks to Josh Schneier for the report.

This issue has severity "low" according to the Django security policy.

CVE-2024-39614: Potential denial-of-service in
django.utils.translation.get_supported_language_variant()
========================================================================================================

``get_supported_language_variant()`` was subject to a potential
denial-of-service
attack when used with very long strings containing specific characters.

To mitigate this vulnerability, the language code provided to
``get_supported_language_variant()`` is now parsed up to a maximum length
of 500
characters.

Thanks to `MProgrammer <https://hackerone.com/mprogrammer>`_ for the report.

This issue has severity "moderate" according to the Django security policy.
