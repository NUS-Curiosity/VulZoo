Subject: [OSSA-2024-002] OpenStack Nova: Incomplete file access fix and
 regression for QCOW2 backing files and VMDK flat descriptors
 (CVE-2024-40767)

==================================================================
OSSA-2024-002: Incomplete file access fix and regression for QCOW2
               backing files and VMDK flat descriptors
==================================================================

:Date: July 23, 2024
:CVE: CVE-2024-40767

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Nova: <27.4.1, >=28.0.0 <28.2.1, >=29.0.0 <29.1.1

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Arnaud Morin (OVH) reported a vulnerability in Nova. By supplying a
raw format image which is actually a specially crafted QCOW2 image
with a backing file path or VMDK flat image with a descriptor file
path, an authenticated user may convince systems to return a copy of
the referenced fileâ€™s contents from the server resulting in
unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data. All Nova
deployments are affected.

Notes
~~~~~
- The patches linked above should apply cleanly to the public state
  of their respective branches at time of disclosure, and depend on
  some commits which merged after the `OSSA-2024-001
  <https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2024-001.html>`_ fixes
  as well as the final states of the Nova changes linked from that
  advisory (those did see some minor adjustments before they
  merged).
- The QCOW2 issue is due to an incomplete fix in OSSA-2024-001
  affecting systems where the ``use_cow_images`` configuration
  option is disabled, while the VMDK issue is a regression of the
  earlier `OSSA-2023-002
  <https://security.openstack.org/ossa/OSSA-2023-002.html>`_
  vulnerability reintroduced by the new implementation in
  OSSA-2024-001. Both problems were identified in the final hours
  before OSSA-2024-001 publication but, due to time constraints,
  were redacted from that bug and moved to a separate report.
- Neither the methods introduced in these patches nor the fixes for
  OSSA-2024-001 are capable of blocking malicious images which are
  already resident in Nova's cache. At this time we do not have
  useful operator guidance for identifying and removing such
  existing images from the cache but strongly caution, if you do
  attempt to use the qemu-img tool to find them, to make sure you're
  using a version of it patched for `QEMU CVE-2024-4467
  <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-4467>`_.
