Thank you! I'll email once I have collected all the keys.

Thanks. Good to know this exception exists, but I'm hoping to prod
Fedora to onboard itself as a member anyway.

It was timely .. but there was some scramble in Fedora's security room
the morning the embargo was lifted. It turns out the development Rawhide
branch was not in a buildable state at that moment - not a big deal, I
pointed out at the time that it's more important to fix the stable
releases - but with access to the embargo, someone could have fixed the
Rawhide build in preparation I suppose.

Yeah - the CVE fixes were done by a non-maintainer anyway (Dmitry
understandably has his hands full with fixing RHEL and CentOS Stream).
This is tangential - but having a well-coordinated security team in
Fedora, that participates in this list and in linux-distros, would
likely help - e.g. by ensuring that the ACL of key packages like openssh
correlates to who often contributes to it, and by making sure issues
like these get addressed sooner rather than later.
