 HVM standard VGA handling

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2024-45818 / XSA-463
                               version 2

               Deadlock in x86 HVM standard VGA handling

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The hypervisor contains code to accelerate VGA memory accesses for HVM
guests, when the (virtual) VGA is in "standard" mode.  Locking involved
there has an unusual discipline, leaving a lock acquired past the
return from the function that acquired it.  This behavior results in a
problem when emulating an instruction with two memory accesses, both of
which touch VGA memory (plus some further constraints which aren't
relevant here).  When emulating the 2nd access, the lock that is already
being held would be attempted to be re-acquired, resulting in a
deadlock.

This deadlock was already found when the code was first introduced, but
was analysed incorrectly and the fix was incomplete.  Analysis in light
of the new finding cannot find a way to make the existing locking
discipline work.

In staging, this logic has all been removed because it was discovered
to be accidentally disabled since Xen 4.7.  Therefore, we are fixing the
locking problem by backporting the removal of most of the feature.  Note
that even with the feature disabled, the lock would still be acquired
for any accesses to the VGA MMIO region.

IMPACT
======

A (not necessarily malicious) HVM guest kernel can lock up the entire
host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions 4.6 through 4.19 are vulnerable.  Staging (4.20 dev) is
not vulnerable; as noted above, the functionality was already removed
prior to the discovery of this issue.

Only x86 systems running HVM guests are vulnerable.  Architectures other
than x86 are not vulnerable.

Only HVM guests can leverage the vulnerability.  PVH and PV guests
cannot leverage the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV or PVH guests will avoid this vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Manuel Andreas of Technical University of
Munich.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
