The change is fine - just don't call it a security fix.  Also, this is
hashing and not encryption.

Others pointed out that Gravatar's recommendation is just that - not a
specification - so unless you need interoperability with other servers
implementing Gravatar, you can do better than SHA-256.  Specifically,
use of a keyed hash such as HMAC-SHA256 was suggested and makes sense to
me - as long as the key is generated from a CSPRNG (such as
/dev/urandom) and is large enough (such as 32 bytes).
