Subject: CVE-2024-45772: Apache Lucene Replicator: Deserialization of Untrusted Data

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache Lucene Replicator 4.4.0 before 9.12.0

Description:

Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache Lucene Replicator.

This issue affects Apache Lucene's replicator module: from 4.4.0 before 9.12.0.
The deprecated org.apache.lucene.replicator.http package is affected.
The org.apache.lucene.replicator.nrt package is not affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.12.0, which fixes the issue.

Java serialization filters (such asÂ -Djdk.serialFilter='!*' on the commandline) can mitigate the issue on vulnerable versions without impacting functionality.
