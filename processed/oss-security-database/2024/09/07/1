Subject: libpcap 1.10.5 released with two security fixes

https://seclists.org/tcpdump/2024/q3/3 announced:

> I hope this finds you well.  tcpdump 4.99.5 and libpcap 1.10.5 are now
> available in the usual places [1].  It has been almost 1.5 years since
> the previous .4 releases, so this time it is many more bug fixes and
> improvements than usual.  Among other things libpcap 1.10.5 addresses
> two CVEs that only apply if libpcap was built with the remote packet
> capture support (which is not the default).
>  [...]

> This libpcap release makes various improvements and bug fixes
> available whilst the work on libpcap 1.11 is still in progress.
> Among other things this includes the fixes to two vulnerabilities
> (CVE-2023-7256 discovered by Dora Sweet and CVE-2024-8006 discovered
> by Flavio Toffalini and reported by Nicolas Badoux) in the remote
> packet capture code, which is disabled by default.
