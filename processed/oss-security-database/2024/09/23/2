Subject: CVE-2024-38286: Apache Tomcat: Denial of Service

Affected versions:

- Apache Tomcat 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20
- Apache Tomcat 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24
- Apache Tomcat 9.0.13 through 9.0.89

Description:

Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in 
Apache Tomcat.

This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.0-M20, 
from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.24, from 9.0.13 through 9.0.89. Older, 
unsupported versions may also be affected.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.0-M21, 10.1.25, or

Apache Tomcat, under certain configurations on any platform, allows an 
attacker to cause an OutOfMemoryError by abusing the TLS handshake process.
