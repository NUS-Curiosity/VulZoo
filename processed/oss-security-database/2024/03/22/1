> CVE-2024-28834  Severity Medium; timing sidechannel in deterministic ECDSA
> 
> A vulnerability was found that the deterministic ECDSA code leaks bit-length
> of random nonce which allows for full recovery of the private key used after
> observing a few hundreds to a few thousands of signatures on known messages,
> due to the application of lattice techniques. The issue was reported in the
> issue tracker as #1516.

> https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1516
> 
> Recommendation: To address the issue found upgrade to GnuTLS 3.8.4 or later
> versions.
