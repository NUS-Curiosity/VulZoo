            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2024-2193 / XSA-453

                GhostRace: Speculative Race Conditions

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers at VU Amsterdam and IBM Research have discovered GhostRace;
an analysis of the behaviour of synchronisation primitives under
speculative execution.

Synchronisation primitives are typically formed as an unbounded loop
which waits until a resource is available to be accessed.  This means
there is a conditional branch which can be microarchitecturally bypassed
using Spectre-v1 techniques, allowing an attacker to speculatively
execute critical regions.

Therefore, while a critical region might be safe architecturally, it can
still suffer from data races under speculation with unsafe consequences.

The GhostRace paper focuses on Speculative Concurrent Use-After-Free
issues, but notes that there are many other types of speculative data
hazard to be explored.

For more details, see:
  https://vusec.net/projects/ghostrace

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer the contents of arbitrary host
memory, including memory assigned to other guests.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

GhostRace is a variation of Spectre-v1, and Spectre-v1 is known to
affect a wide range of CPU architectures and designs.  Consult your
hardware vendor.

However, Xen does not have any known gadgets vulnerable to GhostRace at
the time of writing.

Furthermore, even with the vulnerable instance found in Linux, the
researchers had to insert an artificial syscall to make the instance
more accessible to a userspace attacker.

Therefore, The Xen Security Team does not believe that immediate action
is required.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations.

RESOLUTION
==========

Out of caution, the Xen Security Team have provided hardening patches
including the addition of a new LOCK_HARDEN mechanism on x86 similar to
the existing BRANCH_HARDEN.

LOCK_HARDEN is off by default, owing to the uncertainty of there being a
vulnerability under Xen, and uncertainty over the performance impact.

However, we expect more research to happen in this area, and feel it is
prudent to have a mitigation in place.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

NOTE ABOUT IPI LIVELOCK
=======================

A observation from the GhostRace paper, unrelated to speculation, is the
ability of userspace to livelock the kernel with IPIs.  While the
GhostRace paper is specific to Linux, similar primitives exist for guest
kernels.

However, after analysis and experimentation, The Xen Security Team are
not aware of a way for a guest kernel to mount a similar attack against
Xen.
