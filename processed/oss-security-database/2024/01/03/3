Subject: CVE-2023-47804: Apache OpenOffice: Macro URL arbitrary script
 execution

*** This announcement is a correction to the one sent on 28 December 2023.
*** The "Affected versions" information was wrong.

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache OpenOffice through 4.1.14

Description:

Apache OpenOffice documents can contain links that call internal macros with arbitrary arguments. Several URI Schemes are defined for this purpose.

Links can be activated by clicks, or by automatic document events.

The execution of such links must be subject to user approval.

In the affected versions of OpenOffice, approval for certain links is not requested; when activated, such links could therefore result in arbitrary script execution.

This is a corner case of CVE-2022-47502.
