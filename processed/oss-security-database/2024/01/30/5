The commit above was fixed in the following kernels:
	5.2.19 5.3.4 5.4
and was fixing an issue that showed up in the 4.19.99 and 5.2 kernel
releases.

I can queue this up to the 4.19.y kernel tree next week if people really
think this is needed, would have been nice if whom ever created the CVE
would have done so :(

This commit is fixed in the following kernel trees:
	4.14.312 4.19.280 5.4.240 5.10.177 5.15.87 6.0.18 6.1.4 6.2
So I think that all actively supported kernel.org releases are ok.

Yeah, that looks really high but who knows how CVSS scores really are
calculated :)
