   PowerDNS Security Advisory 2024-04: Crafted responses can lead to a denial of
   service due to cache inefficiencies in the Recursor

   CVE: CVE-2024-25590
   Date: 3rd of October 2024.
   Affects: PowerDNS Recursor up to and including 4.9.8, 5.0.8 and 5.1.1
   Not affected: PowerDNS Recursor 4.9.9, 5.0.9 and 5.1.2
   Severity: High
   Impact: Denial of service
   Exploit: This problem can be triggered by an attacker publishing a crafted zone
   Risk of system compromise: None
   Solution: Upgrade to patched version


   An attacker can publish a zone containing specific Resource Record
   Sets. Repeatedly processing and caching results for these sets can lead
   to a denial of service.

   CVSS Score: 7.5, see CVSS Calculator[1]

   The remedy is: upgrade to a patched version.

   We would like to thank Toshifumi Sakaguchi for bringing this issue to
   our attention and assisting in validating the patches.
