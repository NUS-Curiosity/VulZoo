Subject: CVE-2024-36905: Linux kernel: Divide-by-zero on shutdown of TCP_SYN_RECV sockets

Hello,

We would like to ask your advice about the CVE-2024-36905 (tcp shutdown vulnerability).
NIST indicates a network vector while AWS and Red Hat indicates local attack vector.
Our cybersecurity team has difficulties to justify that a local vector is appropriate here.
Can you help us to understand this specific point for this CVE ? The hypothesis we have is that a TCP socket need to be open/closed quickly, and maybe it's not possible remotely ? 

Thanks for the feedback!

Best Regards
J. Guittet
