True, we don't have that yet, but with the scripts in there, it should
be easy to knock this up (hint, pass the id to scripts/cve_search) if
you need it.

The issue is, CVEs are assigned usually long _AFTER_ the stable release
has happened.  So if you want to do this type of report for the latest
stable release, it will look like there are no CVEs.  But if you wait a
few weeks, suddenly that old release will have many CVEs assigned to
them.

This is just due to the process we currently have where we review each
commit in the stable releases to determine if a CVE should be assigned
or not.  Obviously this takes time and we are running a few weeks behind
the current releases.

So you would have to run the script a lot, to keep it up to date, which
is why a "how many CVEs are listed in the latest release" isn't really
going to be all that valuable to your users.

That would be great, for where we know, we list when a vulnerability was
added to the tree, and where it was fixed.  That can leave many branches
still vulnerable where we have not fixed the issue yet.  One example
would be CVE-2024-26629.

You can see these in our repo by just doing:
	git grep "5\.10" | grep introduced | grep -v fixed

But note that for some issues, we don't have the information for when
they are introduced, so if they are not fixed in the 5.10 branch, does
that mean the branch _is_ vulnerable, or is not?  One example of a "is
not" might be CVE-2024-35867 as we think the code isn't present in 5.10,
but we don't have an automated way of determining that.  So that would
take more work than just a simple grep of the tree.

How about something as simple as the following to see what is in
5.10.101:

	for id in $(git log --format="%H" v5.10.100..v5.10.101); do
		cve=$(cve_search ${id})
		cve_found=$?
		if [[ "${cve_found}" == "0" ]]; then
			echo "${cve} is in range"
		fi
	done

Note, typed in email client, not tested, use at your own risk...

hope this helps,
