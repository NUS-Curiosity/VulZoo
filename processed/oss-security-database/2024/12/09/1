Subject: [SECURITY][ANNOUNCE] Apache Subversion 1.14.5 released

I'm happy to announce the release of Apache Subversion 1.14.5.

This is a stable bugfix and security release of the Apache Subversion
open source version control system.

Among regular bug fixes, this release fixes CVE-2024-46901:

mod_dav_svn denial-of-service via control characters in paths

It has been discovered that the patch for CVE-2013-1968 was incomplete
and unintentionally left mod_dav_svn vulnerable to control characters
in filenames.

If a path or a revision-property which contains control characters is
committed to a repository then SVN operations served by mod_dav_svn
can be disrupted.
