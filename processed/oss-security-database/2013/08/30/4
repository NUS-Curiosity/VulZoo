I'd like to request a CVE for these vulnerabilities I disclosed back
on Sept 27 2012.
http://vapid.dhs.org/advisories/python_for_ipad.html
YingZhi Python Programming Language for iOS
Vendor: XiaoWen Huang, YingZhi Python for iOS.
Ver 1.9.
OSVDB IDs: 96719 & 96720

Python Interpreter is a native python development application for the
iPad/iPhone. It is available for iOS 4 and above.
The product is packaged with its own httpd and ftpd servers. Enabling
the local daemons for development by Touching Computer<->This Machine
starts up an httpd server and ftpd server, both daemons are bound to
device IP not localhost.

httpd server allows upload of arbitrary files to root WWW directory.
Browsing to http://<target_ip>:8080/ presents an index page in which
anyone can upload files to the web servers root directory.

Use CVE-2013-5654. Support for anonymous upload is, at least, rare in
HTTP servers and this behavior would seem to violate reasonable user
expectations.

If you have any further information about the specific statements in
OSVDB entry 96720, please let us know. For example, have you confirmed
that the default configuration of this HTTP server enables a PHP
interpreter, such that uploads of .php files are especially dangerous?
 

I just checked and it appears the http server doesn't interpret .php, .cgi or .py, it only serves basic content.

ftp server vulnerable to ../ bug
The ftp server doesn't sanitize user input and allows remote users to
read and possibly write to the devices storage.
ftp://192.168.0.24:10000/../../../../../../../private/etc/passwd

Use CVE-2013-5655.


The ftp server doesn't bother authenticating users, any
username/password combination will allow you in.

We're not immediately assigning a CVE ID for this authentication
behavior because it might be an intentional part of the vendor's
design, and might have been reasonable in the vendor's envisioned
development environment. If there is any documentation suggesting that
this is instead an authentication bypass (e.g., the product allows the
user to configure a username/password combination), the assignment can
of course be reconsidered.
