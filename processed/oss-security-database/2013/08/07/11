Subject: Reserved CVE for pip

So I was researching pip's CVE's some more and I came across CVE-2013-1888 which Kurt assigned http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/03/22/10 but which shows up as RESERVED https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-1888.

Can you fix this so it's not RESERVED Kurt?
