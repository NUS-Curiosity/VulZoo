Subject: [OSSA 2013-020] Denial of Service in Nova network source security
 groups (CVE-2013-4185)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-020
CVE: CVE-2013-4185
Date: August 6, 2013
Title: Denial of Service in Nova network source security groups
Reporter: Vishvananda Ishaya (Nebula)
Products: Nova
Affects: All versions

Description:
Vishvananda Ishaya from Nebula reported a denial of service
vulnerability in Nova's handling of network source security group
policy updates. By performing a large number of server creation
operations, the proportion of updates increases quadratically and
may overwhelm nova-network such that it is no longer able to service
other requests in a timely fashion. Only setups relying on
nova-network are affected.

Folsom fix:

Notes:

in a future 2013.1.3 release.
