Can you post a link to this ZDnet article? I don't think it can be the
one linked in the CVE description itself, because that talks about a
different, earlier bug IIUC; I privately asked Matt Dillon, who
discovered Errata 721, and he agreed that this CVE talks about a
different (but maybe related) Errata, #793.
