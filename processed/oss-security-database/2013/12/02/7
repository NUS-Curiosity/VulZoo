MITRE typically does not know about multi-party embargo arrangements
affecting Linux vendors and various other vendors, and did not know
about any multi-party embargo arrangement in this case. If anyone who
is regularly involved in vulnerability remediation affecting the
open-source community asks MITRE to send an announcement of a CVE
assignment to oss-security, we send that announcement without any
investigation of disclosure restrictions. Although it is unfortunate
if such an announcement had an adverse effect on a planned disclosure
timeline, we feel that this is an isolated case and does not mean that
we need to reevaluate our approach. Also, once an issue is mentioned
on oss-security by anyone, we consider the issue fully public and we
sometimes proceed to publish a CVE immediately.
