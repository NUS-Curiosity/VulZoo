I would say this depends on the level of public disclosure. For
example from "upstream" (AMD) there was a very limited disclosure (no
public announcement I'm aware of) and just some notes in a single PDF.
However this was also made public via the person who found it and then
picked up by ZDnet in an article, so I would personally count that as
quite public.

Yes and no, with hardware obviously it's likely that other software
will leave the bug exposed, the problem is finding all of it and
notifying people is a very non trivial task.

That was my fault, I didn't think to ask them to handle this as a
private assignment since the issue was quite public/old (see above).

Don't know.
