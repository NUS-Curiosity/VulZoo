The email (ID 201311280223.rAS2NbPL019021@...us.mitre.org) has the
following links

http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/kernel/2011-December/046594.html

http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/amd-owns-up-to-cpu-bug/18924

And identifies them as related to CVE-2013-6885

Unless DragonflyBSD is giving Write Combining memory to its regular
userspace processes (which would frankly be crazy and cause abysmal
performance - uncacheable reads have a habit of slowing things down
somewhat), I cant see any similarity between the CVE and the problem
described by Matt Dillon in the links.

The zdnet article quotes a statement from AMD of:

Also, this marginal erratum impacts the previous four generations of AMD
Opteron processors which include the AMD Opteron 2300,8300
8300("Barcelona" and "Shanghai",) 2400, 8400 ("Istanbul",) and 4100,
6100 ("Lisbon" and "Magny-Cours") series processors.


None of these generations are the "Jaguar Architecture" Family 16h
identified in the erratum description from #793  Furthermore, Matt
Dillon appears to be under the impression that he found erratum #721.

It therefore appears that the original MITRE email was incorrect as
identifying the two links (refering to #721, and nearly 2 years old
judging by http://article.gmane.org/gmane.os.dragonfly-bsd.kernel/14518)
as related to #793 (whos errata document's inital release was June of
this year).

Can anyone from AMD formally confirm or deny a link between errata #721
and #793 ?
