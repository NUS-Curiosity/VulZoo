The way certificate check was implemented to fix CVE-2013-2073 was
incorrect (check was done on "probe" connection, but not the actual
connection used to transfer data).  This should now be fixed in 0.10
(I can't confirm atm), which switches to use urllib3 with proper
certificate checks.

https://github.com/transifex/transifex-client/commit/6d69d61

This should get a new CVE.
