I don't think this was previously discussed as a security issue in
public.  There is a 2011 reference here that explicitly cites
amplification factors, though:

<http://lists.ntp.org/pipermail/pool/2011-December/005616.html>

This has an odd feeling of déjà vu to me, but I suspect the previous
discusssions have been on private channels of which I no longer have
records.
