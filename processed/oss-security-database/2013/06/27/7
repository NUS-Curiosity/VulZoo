Subject: Re: Re: CVE-2013-1942 jPlayer 2.2.19 XSS


Kurt,

Your CVE assignment posts from [1] and [2] appear to be inconsistent, and 
there are some questions about affected versions, so I wanted to get some 
clarity about which CVEs go with which issues.

1) CVE-2013-1942 - fixed in 2.2.20.
    Commit: e8ca190f7f972a6a421cb95f09e138720e40ed6d

    This one doesn't seem to have any issues.

2) CVE-2013-2022 - based on [1] CVE-2013-2022 is listed after a section
    that talks about an XSS fixed in 2.3.0 (which also includes the
    CVE-2013-1942 assignment).   However, in [2] you say "CVE-2013-2022 is
    for jPlayer 2.2.20 XSS" but http://www.jplayer.org/2.3.0/release-notes/
    says that CVE-2013-2022 is fixed in 2.2.23.  (Maybe when you said
    2.2.20, this also covered other unfixed versions UNTIL 2.2.23).

3) CVE-2013-2023 - in [1] you assign CVE-2013-2023 to the security fix
    that quotes the jPlayer changelog entry for 2.2.23 - which, as just
    mentioned in the previous bullet, you already described as being
    associated with CVE-2013-2022.  In [2], you also state that
    CVE-2013-2023 is for jPlayer 2.2.23 XSS.

4) There is no mention of issues that are FIXED in 2.3.0 based
    on upstream changelog, but http://www.jplayer.org/2.4.0/release-notes/
    lists fixes in both 2.3.1 and 2.3.2.

5) According to jPlayer release notes, we have:

    [2.3.1] Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a minor security vulnerability
    that enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Eugene Dokukin.
    Security reference CVE-2013-2023.

    [2.3.2] Security Fix: Closed Flash SWF security vulnerability that
    enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Eugene Dokukin. Security
    reference CVE-2013-2023. The jPlayer noConflict option is now
    restricted to strings that contain the term jQuery. For example:
    lib.jQuery or myjQueryRocks.

    [2.2.20] Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a security vulnerability that
    enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Malte Batram. Security
    reference CVE-2013-1942.

    [2.2.23] Security Fix: The Flash SWF had a minor security vulnerability
    that enabled XSS (Cross Site Scripting). Reported by Eugene Dokukin.
    Security reference CVE-2013-2022.

I'm of the mindset to use the CVE assignments as provided by jQuery 
upstream, but it may be good to get full clarity down to the individual 
commits.
