I would argue that no one will expect that giving a user the ability to
run CGI scripts in a particular virtualhost context on the system gives
them the ability to intercept and spoof traffic for all virtualhosts on
the system.

Monkey does include virtualhost support and mentions shared hosting as
an example usage scenario in the documentation.

Indeed. I found it very interesting that you objected. To me this seemed
to be a relatively straightforward issue. I appreciate you explaining
your reasoning in more detail.
