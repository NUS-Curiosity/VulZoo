I think you meant makeDirTree() for the function name and not
makeDirTemp(), am I correct?  

I don't know much about the tool but snipped the code around the mkdir()
function for other people to see:

  $ cat -n ruby-passenger-3.0.13debian/ext/common/Utils.cpp
  [...]
  486                 do {
  487                         ret = mkdir(current.c_str(), modeBits);
  488                 } while (ret == -1 && errno == EINTR);
  489                 if (ret == -1) {
  490                         if (errno == EEXIST) {
  491                                 // Ignore error and don't chmod/chown.
  492                                 continue;
  493                         } else {
  494                                 int e = errno;
  495                                 throw FileSystemException("Cannot create directory '" + current + "'",
  496                                         e, current);
  497                         }
  498                 }

I don't see any problem here.  The mkdir() return code appears to be
checked correctly and chmod/chown ignored if directory was previously
created.

Cheers.
