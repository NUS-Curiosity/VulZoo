Indeed. Note the main design & work for the module was done ~10 years ago, so my recollection is a bit fuzzy, but the module was designed such that it allows this invocation against a hypothetical CPAN OpenPGP server:

    env MODULE_SIGNATURE_KEYSERVER=pgp.cpan.org cpansign verify

At that time PAUSE (the CPAN upload server) was not yet made public, and there were insufficient rounds of tuits to implement this feature as part of my TPF 2003 grant .

Now that the PAUSE codebase has been released on GitHub since 2010, one can imagine adding a PGP import functionality into it. That'd be _awesome_.

Cheers,
