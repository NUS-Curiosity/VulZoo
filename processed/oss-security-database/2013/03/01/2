David Jorm (djorm@...hat.com) reports the following issues were
fixed in this release:

=============================================
* Jenkins included spring 2.5.0. This is vulnerable to CVE-2010-1622
and CVE-2011-2730, flaws which can allow for arbitrary remote code
execution:

http://support.springsource.com/security/cve-2010-1622
http://support.springsource.com/security/cve-2011-2730

The way that Jenkins uses spring does not seem to expose an
exploitable use case, but nonetheless it is dangerous to distribute a
component with known serious vulnerabilities. I suggest upgrading to
spring 2.5.6.SEC03 to mitigate these flaws.

* Jenkins included:

jenkins.war (unzip)
- -> WEB-INF/plugin/maven-plugin.hpi (unzip)
- -> WEB-INF/lib/xercesImpl-2.9.1.jar

This copy of xerces is vulnerable to CVE-2009-2625. I have tested with
a reproducer and confirmed it is vulnerable. The flaw relates to how
xerces processes the SYSTEM identifier in DTDs. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once parsed by an
application using xerces, would lead to a denial of service
(application hang due to excessive CPU use). This would be exploitable
on jenkins so long as an attacker can somehow provide an XML file that
jenkins will process using the vulnerable copy of xerces. It seems to
me that this would be possible, but I could be wrong.

Either way, upgrading to xerces >= 2.10.1 will resolve this flaw:

http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/releases.html

=============================================

So three more reasons to update =)

Also does anyone know if kk@...suke.org is the correct email for
Kohsuke Kawaguchi or if there is a better one?
