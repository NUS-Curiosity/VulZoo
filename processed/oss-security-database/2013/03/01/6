Subject: CVE Request: various gems in aftermath of rubygem actionpack issue

Hi,

I think these rubygem updates have got no CVE entry/ies yet:
https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/entries/22915701-january-14-2013-security-vulnerabilities-httparty-extlib-crack-nori-update-these-gems-immediately

Or should we use the Rubygem Action Pack CVE ids for it too (CVE-2013-0156)?

Ciao, Marcus
