It's my real name.  You can imagine what my childhood was like. 

"Hey Cashdollar got change for a dollar?" - No sorry I only carry big bills.
"Hey Cashdollar can I have a dollar?" - No go get a Job.
"Hey Cashdollar got any cash?".... Eh...geez.

I was told by my father that it was an American Indian name from the tribe 'Paycheck'. 

A more realistic answer is it might be dutch for kirchtoller, and was mangled to Cashdollar.

I make up random answers normally when people ask like, I am in the witness protection program etc... I'll spare you the rest
at this point. ;-)
