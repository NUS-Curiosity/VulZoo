It depends on the way you look at it :

For really skilled bad guys, disclosing the vulnerability and the exploit with 
it or not doesn't make such a difference, because in the first place they are 
able to look at the kernel commits and spot what they care about for their 
evil job. No matter, there is public disclosure or not. And these really bad 
guys are not pushed to share this information to everyone. Besides, it seems 
more interesting for this kind of guys to keep their findings secret (to make 
money, to rebel on something through cyber attack means, ...)
(What would be the purpose otherwise? --> Pure Evil? ).

But disclosing to everyone the vulnerability and the exploit _altogether_, 
does benefit all the script kiddies, all the malicious persons not skilled 
enough to develop their own exploits (and we can agree that it depends on the 
vulnerabilities. Remember CVE-2008-0009 and CVE-2008-0010, about vmsplice. It 
was not thoroughly understood by everyone from the beginning).

Thus, my point is that disclosing the vulnerability benefits more the good guys 
than it does increase the risk of the exploitation of the vuln. But disclosing 
the exploit _at the same time_ can only negatively impact the outcome, because 
lots of good guys (end users, but not only, some admins, ...) will not look at 
it, they only bother to know if there is security issues, in order to take a 
decision on updating their systems.

By the way it's only my feelings on this topic.
