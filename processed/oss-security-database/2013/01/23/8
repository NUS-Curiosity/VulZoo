Subject: Xen Security Advisory 35 (CVE-2013-0152) - Nested HVM exposes
 host to being driven out of memory by guest

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-0152 / XSA-35
                           version 4

       Nested HVM exposes host to being driven out of memory by guest

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Fix corrupt patch xsa35-4.2-with-xsa34.patch.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Guests are currently permitted to enable nested virtualization on
themselves. Missing error handling cleanup in the handling code makes
it possible for a guest, particularly a multi-vCPU one, to repeatedly
invoke this operation, thus causing a leak of - over time - unbounded
amounts of memory.

IMPACT
======

A malicious domain can mount a denial of service attack affecting the
whole system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only Xen 4.2 and Xen unstable are vulnerable. Xen 4.1 and earlier are
not vulnerable.

The vulnerability is only exposed by HVM guests.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

To fix both XSA 34 and XSA 35, first apply xsa34-4.2.patch from XSA 34
and then *also* apply xsa35-4.2-with-xsa34.patch from this advisory.

To fix this issue without addressing XSA 34, use xsa35.patch.
