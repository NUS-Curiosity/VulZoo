Here are two more. These are the last two remaining issues found by 
Alessandro Ghedini:
Please assign CVE IDs:

1. Zabbix
https://support.zabbix.com/browse/ZBX-5924

2. Moodle
This one is two-fold. First of all Moodle embeds PHP-Cas and Moodle is thus
affected by CVE-2012-5583 as well. (Same code, so same CVE ID).

Additionally there's another issue specific to Moodle, which requires a CVE
ID:
https://github.com/tpyo/amazon-s3-php-class/pull/36

Cheers,
        Moritz
