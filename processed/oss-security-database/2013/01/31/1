 Forum <= 2.0.3 (CVE-2013-0192) (fwd)


FYI:

Kurt has indicated that the 2009 disclosure affects 1.x, and the new 
affects 2.x, so they warrant separate CVEs. This is the official request 
for it.

Thanks for the information Carlos.

Kurt; This was originally disclosed in 2009 (see OSVDB 86444 [1]) and
re-discovered in January 13. If you concur, do you want to see about
issuing a 2009 CVE? One was never issued for the original disclosure.
