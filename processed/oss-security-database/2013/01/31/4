I'm splitting this one since it's a vuln in Drupal and another in jQuery.

A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) was identified in
certain Drupal JavaScript functions that pass unexpected user input
into jQuery causing it to insert HTML into the page when the intended
behavior is to select DOM elements. Multiple core and contributed
modules are affected by this issue.

Please use CVE-2013-0244 for this issue.



jQuery versions 1.6.3 and higher provide protection against common
forms of this problem; thus, the vulnerability is mitigated if your
site has upgraded to a recent version of jQuery. However, the versions
of jQuery that are shipped with Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 core do not
contain this protection.

No CVE for this in Drupal as previously discussed. TLDR: no vuln no
CVE, but preventing exploitation of third party components/etc is a
nice and correct thing to do. Assigned a CVE for jQuery 1.6.2 in
previous email.
