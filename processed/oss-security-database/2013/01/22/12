Multiple XSS vulnerabilities (oC-SA-2013-001)
=================================
Web: http://owncloud.org/about/security/advisories/oC-SA-2013-001/

CVE IDENTIFIERS
==============
CVE-2013-0201, CVE-2013-0202, CVE-2013-0203

AFFECTED SOFTWARE
==================
ownCloud Server < 4.5.6
ownCloud Server < 4.0.11

DESCRIPTION
===========
Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in ownCloud 4.5.5
and 4.0.10 and all prior versions allow remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via

- the GET parameters to resetpassword.php in
core/lostpassword/templates/ (CVE-2013-0201)
  - Commits: c05c8ab (stable45), 4e2b834 (stable4)
  - Risk: Medium
  - Note: This is a reflected XSS, which can be only abused using
Internet Explorer 9 and prior.
- the mime parameter to mimeicon.php in apps/files/ajax/ (CVE-2013-0201)
  - Commits: b8e0309 (stable45), f603454 (stable4)
  - Risk: Medium
  - Note: This is a reflected XSS, which only affects ownCloud
versions hosted by Windows.
- the token parameter to sharing.php in apps/gallery/ (CVE-2013-0201)
  - Commits: 34ac2f5 (stable45), f71f0ad (stable4)
  - Risk: Medium
  - Note: This is a reflected XSS, for a successful exploitation the
"gallery" app needs to be enabled.
- the action parameter to sharing.php in core/ajax/ (CVE-2013-0202)
  - Commits: fb334f3 (stable45), 306d5ee (stable4)
  - Risk: Low
  - Note: This is a self XSS, for a successful exploitation the user
needs to enter malicious Javascript on his own.
- the POST parameters to new.php in apps/calendar/ajax/event/ (CVE-2013-0203)
  - Commits: 9e6ba80e (stable45), 708bd (stable4)
  - Risk: High
  - Note: This is a stored XSS, for a successful exploitation the
"calendar" app needs to be enabled. An authenticated remote attacker
may be able to share this crafted event with other users.
- the url parameter to addBookmark.php in apps/bookmarks/ajax/ (CVE-2013-0203)
  - Commits: 6aba1e8 (stable45), 3f37063 (stable4)
  - Risk: Low
  - Note: This is a stored XSS, for a successful exploitation the
"bookmarks" app needs to be enabled.

authenticated remote attackers may be able to execute arbitrary code
by entering special crafted PHP code in the mount point settings.
