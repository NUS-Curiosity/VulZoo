MITRE has never had any restrictions on CVEs for issues that exist
only in release-candidate software or only in beta software. See for
example "Attendees agreed that CVE should include problems in beta
software, provided that the beta code was intended for public
dissemination" in the
http://cve.mitre.org/data/board/archives/2000-03/msg00007.html post.

These CVEs tend to be rare, possibly because they are useful to fewer
people. Recent examples in which a major vendor specifically chose to
assign a CVE name to an issue affecting only beta software are:

  CVE-2009-2968 - VMware Studio 2.0 public beta

  CVE-2010-0113 - Symantec Norton Mobile Security 1.0 Beta

A few months ago, MITRE started to draft some rough guidelines for a
case of a vendor who was considering use of CVEs during beta testing.
That case seems mostly inapplicable to the current question
(CVE-2013-3236, CVE-2013-3237, etc. weren't in any sense based on
"vendor" requests), but we might be able to share guidelines at some
point if any vendor here is in a similar position.
