Thanks for the explanation, but, given the rate-of-churn[1] in the Linux
kernel -rc releases, I would be really wary to start wanting to assign
CVEs to things that only show up in these types of kernel releases.

Unless you really want to be swamped with requests, it's your choice :)

Linux kernel -rc releases are for developers, and for those people
wanting to help with Linux kernel development, they are not for anyone
to run on any system that they do not to expect to immediately explode
into a bunch of pieces, let alone expect to be "perfect" from a security
standpoint.

These releases are much different from the two closed-source products
you list above, which are not developed in the open, and rely on "public
beta" releases to do some of their testing on real-world systems.  As
the Linux kernel is developed entirely in the open, starting to want to
assign CVE entries to issues that show up in one -rc release, and are
fixed before the final kernel release, seems a bit odd.

But hey, it's your system, not mine, good luck.
