Subject: RE: OS command injection vulnerability in Chicken
 Scheme

Despite popular perception, the presence of useful details does not necessarily get CVEs published more quickly (although missing or conflicting details certainly make things worse, and poorly-written advisories can reduce overall throughput).  We have particular description styles and analytical requirements that are not visible to the general public.  We have a process where we actively monitor public sources including oss-security, and we prioritize which CVE entries are published first.  Priorities are currently guided by
http://cve.mitre.org/data/board/archives/2012-09/msg00000.html, but other disclosures are certainly considered as well.

We are currently focused on working with the CVE Editorial Board on extending the CVE ID syntax to handle more than 10,000 vulnerabilities per year, and we are also training several new hires.  We expect our output to rise noticeably within a few months, and we will continue to refine our analysis and publication processes to improve our production in a way that balances the needs of CVE's many diverse users.
