Yes, I suggested this as a possibility here:

What is a fork hook, and how would it install one?

Yes, or the PID may simply be mixed in on each and every request for a
pseudo-random number.  (Isn't this already the case?  Need to check.)
If such mixing, including of that of the rest of the entropy sources,
is cryptographically strong, then one sibling process' pseudo-random
number stream would not reveal another sibling's, unless there's also a
memory contents leak.  The fact that the PID itself is low-entropy is OK
as long as sufficient entropy is obtained from other sources (before the
fork() is OK) and its mixing is cryptographically strong (and was such
on any pre-fork() requests for random numbers as well), again assuming
no memory contents leak from any of the processes.
