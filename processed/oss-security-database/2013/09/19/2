Subject: OpenStack: Glance image creation in other tenant accounts (CVE-2013-4354)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

With apologies, I was supposed to send this out yesterday but missed
it. I spoke with upstream and we agreed that making this public does
not present a major risk.

- From https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-4354

==========
Dafna Ron of Red Hat reports:

Description of problem:

when I try to create an image with tenant name and not tenant ID, the
image is not created and no errors are issued.
you simply cannot find the image.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):

openstack-glance-2013.1.3-1.el6ost.noarch

How reproducible:

100%

Steps to Reproduce:
1. install AIO with local tgt storage (using packstack)
2. create a tenant and a user
3. create an image for the tenant using the tenant name
4. run glance image-list while logging in with user
5. run the same create command using tenant ID
6. run glance image-list while logging in with the user

Actual results:

image is no created with tenant name.
no errors or indicators that the image was not created.

Expected results:

image should be created with tenant name
if we decided not to allow create of image with tenant name we should
block the command from running with missing param error

========

Upon further investigation Flavio Percoco of Red Hat reports:

Ayal suggested this could also be a security issue. I went ahead and
tested current behavior and indeed, this behavior could be used to
inject images to other users.

Scenario:
- - Create an image using user1
- - Pick tenant's id of user2 and add it as a member of the image user1
just created
- - Use user2 to list images. This will list the image user1 created.

I think this is an issue because it allows user from other tenants to
sneak images with a backdoor to other tenants.
