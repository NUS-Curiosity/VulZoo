This is not necessary since we don't use these "too recent" kernels, but
thanks for offering.

Here's a curious tweet:

<_argp> Since full-disclosure has been DDoSed to oblivion, here's huku's sock_diag 1 year-old exploit: http://pastebin.com/gwn1qErx

The pastebin has:

Who the fuck DDoS'ed full-disclosure? ;)

Two of the files in the tarball have timestamps of 2012-07-14.  Of
course, this is no proof, but it does appear that the bug was privately
known since about July 2012.  The README says:

"A trimmed down version of an old exploit for the recently published
`sock_diag_handlers[]' vulnerability :("

The code contains:

  printf("Linux kernel >= 3.2 NETLINK_INET_DIAG 0day\n");
  printf("by huku <huku _at_ grhack _dot_ net>\n");

Is ">= 3.2" an error (should have been ">= 3.3" as your original posting
in here said)?  (The difference may be whether Ubuntu 12.04 is affected.)
