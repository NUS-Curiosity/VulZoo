Subject: [OSSA-2013-006] VNC proxy can connect to the wrong VM (CVE-2013-0335)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-006
CVE: CVE-2013-0335
Date: February 26, 2013
Title: VNC proxy can connect to the wrong VM
Reporter: Loganathan Parthipan (HP), Rohit Karajgi (NTT Data)
Products: Nova
Affects: All versions

Description:
Loganathan Parthipan (HP) and Rohit Karajgi (NTT Data) independently
reported a vulnerability in Nova. If a user requests a console and
then deletes the VM, it is possible that the console token could allow
connectivity to a different VM before the console token expires if the
VNC port gets reused in that time period. This issue can be worked
around by disabling VNC support.

Fixes:
master (grizzly): https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22086/

stable/essex: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/22872/
