             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-0231 / XSA-43
			      version 2

         Linux pciback DoS via not rate limited log messages.

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Xen's PCI backend drivers in Linux allow a guest with assigned PCI device(s)
to cause a DoS through a flood of kernel messages, potentially affecting other
domains in the system.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest can mount a DoS affecting the entire system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All systems running guests with access to passed through PCI devices are
vulnerable.

Both mainline ("pvops") and classic-Xen patch kernels are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices to untrusted
guests.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

xsa43-pvops.patch            Apply to mainline Linux 3.8-rc5.
xsa43-classic.patch          Apply to linux-2.6.18-xen tree.
