Stupid Q, is there like an official security page? POsting stuff to a
forum is not exactly the easiest place to find things, can they setup
like zoneminder.com/security/ and at least list all the security
issues and link to them there so people don't have to dig through the
forums?

I say this because this is the first cve request I've ever seen for
zoneminder since I started assigning, and indeed, since 2008, so I'm
guessing there's a few more missing ones......

If someone wants to big through the forums to find them and post them
here that would probably be helpful (seriously, wanna pad your resume
and get a reference from me? first person to make 100 good CVE
requests wins).
