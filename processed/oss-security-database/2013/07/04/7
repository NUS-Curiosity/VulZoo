Subject: CVE Request -- gallery3 (3.0.9): Fixing two security flaws

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  Gallery upstream has released 3.0.9 version, correcting two security flaws:
  [1] http://galleryproject.org/gallery_3_0_9

My guess [***] is the two issues are as follows:

* Issue #1 - Improper stripping of URL fragments in flowplayer
SWF file might lead to reply attacks (a different flaw than CVE-2013-2138):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A security flaw was found in the way flowplayer SWF file handling functionality
  of Gallery version 3, an open source project with the goal to develop and
  support leading photo sharing web application solutions, processed certain
  URL fragments passed to this file (certain URL fragments were not stripped
  properly when these files were called via direct URL request(s)). A remote
  attacker could use this flaw to conduct replay attacks.

  A different vulnerability than CVE-2013-2138.

  Upstream ticket:
  [2] http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gallery/ticket/2073

  Relevant upstream patch:
  [3] https://github.com/gallery/gallery3/commit/c5318bb1a2dd266b50317a2adb74d74338593733

  References:

* Issue #2 - gallery3: Multiple information exposure flaws in data rest core module
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Multiple information exposure flaws were found in the way data rest core module
  of Gallery version 3, an open source project with the goal to develop and support
  leading photo sharing web application solutions, used to previously restrict access
  to certain items of the photo album. A remote attacker, valid Gallery 3 user, could
  use this flaw to possibly obtain sensitive information (file, resize or thumb path
  of the item in question).

  Upstream ticket:
  [5] http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gallery/ticket/2074

  Relevant upstream patch (against 3.0.x branch):
  [6] https://github.com/gallery/gallery3/commit/cbbcf1b4791762d7da0ea7b6c4f4b551a4d9caed

  References:

Could you allocate CVE identifiers for these?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

[***] Guess because the issues aren't more thoroughly described in upstream announcement [1]
      and former (private) email check with Gallery3 upstream didn't provide more details
      either. Cc-ed them on this post too, they to correct me where necessary.
