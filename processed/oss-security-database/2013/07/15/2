After talking to upstream, the above issue with the temp directory has
been fixed in 4.0.6 (release withdrawn and replaced by 4.0.7 due to a
regression), and a regression fixed in 4.0.8[2]. The issue was tracked
as #910[3].

Could a CVE id be assigned then?

It allows a local user to DoS the service or to take over its traffic.
