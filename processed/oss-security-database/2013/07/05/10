So the emails covering this:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/04/12/6

CVE-2013-0338 - libxml2 internal entity expansion

CVE-2013-0339 - libxml2 external entities expansion

For CVE-2013-0340 and CVE-2013-0339, there are "workarounds" available
for application developers, although such workarounds may be very
expensive to develop, and this might place "too much" responsibility
to the developers - so, these assignments may still be OK.  It is
still worth discussion.

So same problem, just a new (better) fix is my take, Steve, does that
work for you as well?
