Yes, I've seen this in the archives (on the openwall.com site).  I'm
subscribed to the list, and now I received two messages from you -- one
sent to me directly and another that went to the list.  For two other
mails - the CVE-2013-2238 assignment (message from Kurt) and your note
about it I received nothing at all.

I'll watch archives from now on, to detect further mail loss and to try
to understand what's going on.

(And this is now not relevant to FreeSWITCH ofcourse... ;)

Thanks!
