My reasoning here was that Python 2 and 3 constitute "forked" or
separate code bases, so fall under CVE SPLIT.evidence includes:

1) Python 2to3, a lot of Python code needs work to move from 2 to 3
2) This feature was added as standard in Python 3 and then later back
ported to 2

Steve, can we get a referees decision here? Thanks.
