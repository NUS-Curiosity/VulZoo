Subject: Two libtiff (tiff2pdf flaws)

Hi all,

Two flaws were reported to us in tiff2pdf utility shipped with the
libtiff library. Details as follows:

1. CVE-2013-1961 libtiff (tiff2pdf): Stack-based buffer overflow with
malformed image-length and resolution

A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF
image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of
functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format
files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF
document file, when malformed image-length and resolution values are
used in the TIFF file. A remote attacker could provide a specially-
crafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would
lead to tiff2pdf executable crash.

2.  CVE-2013-1960 libtiff (tiff2pdf): Heap-based buffer overflow in
t2_process_jpeg_strip()

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF
image to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of
functions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format
files, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF
document file, in the tp_process_jpeg_strip() function. A remote
attacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that
when processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash or,
potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
running the tiff2pdf binary.
