Subject: CVE-2013-2069 livecd-tools: improper handling of passwords 

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=964299

The livecd-tools package provides support for reading and executing
Kickstart files in order to create a system image. It was discovered
that livecd-tools gave the root user an empty password rather than
leaving the password locked in situations where no 'rootpw' directive
was used or when the 'rootpw --lock' directive was used within the
Kickstart file, which could allow local users to gain access to the
root account. (CVE-2013-2069)

Please note that livecd-tools is also used by appliance-tools to create
images used for virtual machines, USB based systems, and so on.
Additionally, the Python script components of livecd-tools have been
broken out into a separate package named python-imgcreate on some
distributions (such as Fedora).
