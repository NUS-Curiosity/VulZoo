Subject: [Notification] CVE-2013-2765 mod_security: NULL pointer dereference
 (DoS, crash) when forceRequestBodyVariable action triggered and unknown
 Content-Type was used

Hello Steve, vendors,

  as brought to me by Athmane, ModSecurity upstream has release v2.7.4 version:
  [1] http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=30900019

correcting one security NULL pointer dereference flaw (CVE-2013-2765) - from [2]:

* Fixed Remote Null Pointer DeReference (CVE-2013-2765). When forceRequestBodyVariable
  action is triggered and a unknown Content-Type is used, mod_security will crash
  trying to manipulate msr->msc_reqbody_chunks->elts however msr->msc_reqbody_chunks
  is NULL. (Thanks Younes JAAIDI).
