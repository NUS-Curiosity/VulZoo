Subject: RE: [Openstack] [OSSA 2013-011] Keystone tokens not immediately
 invalidated when user is deleted (CVE-2013-2059)

General question:

Looks like a fix has been written for Grizzly. Is there an official Grizzly patch release coming out that contains this and other fixes? 

Regards,

Mark Miller

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-011
CVE: CVE-2013-2059
Date: May 9, 2013
Title: Keystone tokens not immediately invalidated when user is deleted
Reporter: Sam Stoelinga
Products: Keystone
Affects: All versions

Description:
Sam Stoelinga reported a vulnerability in Keystone. When users are
deleted through Keystone v2 API, existing tokens for those users are not
immediately invalidated and remain valid for the duration of the token's
life (by default, up to 24 hours). This may result in users retaining
access when the administrator of the system thought them disabled. You
can workaround this issue by disabling a user before deleting it: in
that case the tokens belonging to the disabled user are immediately
invalidated. Keystone setups using the v3 API call to delete users are
unaffected.
