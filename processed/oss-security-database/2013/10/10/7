Our current process for rejecting as a duplicate requires that the
REJECT description specify the duplicated CVE ID. Would you be able to
say which one (1870 or 4398) had the duplicate/same-root-cause
situation, and the correct CVE ID for the vulnerability with that root
cause?

We would want this information even if the correct CVE ID still refers
to an embargoed issue.
