Welp I can't argue with data (well I could, but that would be silly).

Please use:

CVE-2013-4440 pwgen non-tty passwords are trivially weak by default

CVE-2013-4441 pwgen Phonemes mode has heavy bias and is enabled by default

CVE-2013-4442 pwgen Silent fallback to insecure entropy

CVE-2013-4443 pwgen Secure mode has bias towards numbers and uppercase
letters
