Please use CVE-2013-4395 for the XSS vuln.

Which XSS vuln? =) That thread was messy, but Henri and others appear to 
have identified and/or confirmed four different ones:

/Sources/ManageServer.php Multiple XSS
http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q3/607
http://custom.simplemachines.org/upgrades/index.php?action=upgrade;file=smf_patch_2.0.5.tar.gz;smf_version=2.0.4

index.php admin Action desc Parameter Stored XSS

That is what I took away from the entire thread at least. Can someone 
confirm this is correct, and can you confirm the CVE assignment please 
Kurt?
