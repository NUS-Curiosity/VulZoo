 images (CVE-2013-4428)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-027
CVE: CVE-2013-4428
Date: October 22, 2013
Title: Glance image_download policy not enforced for cached images
Reporter: Stuart McLaren (HP)
Products: Glance
Affects: Grizzly, Folsom (and earlier versions)

Description:
Stuart McLaren from HP reported a vulnerability in Glance download_image
policy enforcement in the case of cached images. Deployers may opt to
set a download_image policy to restrict image download to specific
roles. However, when an image is previously cached by an authorized
download, any authenticated user could download image contents if it can
determine the image UUID, bypassing any download_image policy
restrictions. This could result in disclosure of image contents that
were thought to be protected by the download_image policy setting. Only
setups making use of the download_image policy are affected.

The Havana release (2013.2) is not affected.

Grizzly fix (included in 2013.1.4 recent release):
