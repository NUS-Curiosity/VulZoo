Subject: CVE request: Escape Sequence Command Execution vulnerability in
 Terminology 0.7

Hi,

Terminology 0.7.0 suffers from a bug similar to CVE-2003-0063, where an
attacker able to print character escape sequences can modify the window
title and then insert it back in the terminal's input buffer, resulting
in arbitrary terminal input, including code execution as a local user.

A concrete attack scenario can work as follows: the attacker gets a
string triggering the vulnerability into a log file (or any other thing
that eventually gets displayed to the user).  When it is, at some later
point, displayed to the user, "echo 'evil'\n" gets written to the user's
terminal's input buffer, resulting in that command being executed by the
user's shell.

For example:

> printf "\e]2;echo 'evil'\n\a\e]2;?\a"


The issue was fixed in Terminology by
commit b80bedc7c21ecffe99d8d142930db696eebdd6a5 :

  https://git.enlightenment.org/apps/terminology.git/commit/?id=b80bedc7c21ecffe99d8d142930db696eebdd6a5

I would like to apply for a CVE number for this issue,
on behalf of the Debian security team.
