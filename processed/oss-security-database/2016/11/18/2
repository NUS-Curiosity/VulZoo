Subject: Re: CVE-2016-4484: - Cryptsetup Initrd root Shell

Good debate.

Actually when using full disk encryption, to lock the BIOS and GRUB must
be mandatory, otherwise you are protecting your confidentiality but not
your integrity. Even with a password in GRUB with an unprotected BIOS
you can also boot from a USB device and access encrypted partitions,
delete them, etc.

Just to mention another method complimentary to the "rd.shell=0" a
similar behaviour to this "flaw" can be achieved using at the boot
sequence "rd.break=pre-udev", this also gives you a root shell with
access to the hard disk.

Regards
