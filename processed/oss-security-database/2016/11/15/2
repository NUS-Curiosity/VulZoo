Subject: CVE-2016-8646: linux kernel - oops in shash_async_export()

Gday,

Igor Redko from Virtuozzo found a vulnerability was found in the Linux
kernel. An unprivileged local user could triger oops in
shash_async_export() by attempting to force the in-kernel hashing
algorithms into decrypting an empty data set.  Not all in kernel algorithms
are affected.

Upstream has already fixed this issue (See upstream patch) in 4.4rc1.

Thanks,
