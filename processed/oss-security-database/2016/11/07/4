Can you please clarify on the scope of CVE-2016-9178?

I assume this is for the leak fixed with 1c109fabbd51863475cd12ac206bdd249aee35af,
but the LWN comment by Brad Spengler referenced above refers to a new issue
which affected some Linux stable lines, which backported 
1c109fabbd51863475cd12ac206bdd249aee35af without also backporting
548acf19234dbda5a52d5a8e7e205af46e9da840.

So please assign a second CVE ID for the latter.

Cheers,
        Moritz
