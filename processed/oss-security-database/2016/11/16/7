If you set a grub password then the attacker cannot set init=/bin/sh on
the kernel command line without knowing the grub password.   However,
when the boot process prompts you for the encrypted volume password you
can just hit enter until you eventually get a shell prompt.  Of course,
the attacker needs to be able to see the console where the password is
typed in ...
