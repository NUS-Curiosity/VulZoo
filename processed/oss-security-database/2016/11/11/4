Subject: CVE-2016-8639: Foreman stored XSS in orgs/locations in settings

CVE-2016-8639: Foreman settings dropdown menus may run stored XSS in
organization/location name

If an organization or location is created with a name containing HTML,
then the administrator-only Settings page will render the HTML as part
of a dropdown menu.

This may permit a stored XSS attack if an organization/location with
HTML in the name is created, then an administrator attempts to change
the default organization/location settings.

Mitigation: restrict permissions to organization and location creation,
use the API or CLI instead to change the default organization/location
settings.

Note: this CVE identifier has been assigned retrospectively, to describe
a vulnerability that was fixed during a refactoring of the affected code.

This issue was reported by Sanket Jagtap.
