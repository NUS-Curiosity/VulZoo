CVE-2016-7077: information disclosure from association lists shown without 
authorization

Lists of associated resources, such as operating systems associated to a new 
architecture, are not restricted to listing resources that the user is 
authorized to view, when rendering with fewer than six items. The list will 
show all possible associated resources, disclosing their names.

Affects Foreman 1.1 and higher, but was first mitigated against in Foreman 
1.9.0 for some cases

Patch available at https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/pull/3955
Fix will be released in Foreman 1.14 (to be released)
For more information please see Redmine issue 
http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/16971
