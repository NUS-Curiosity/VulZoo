Subject: Re: CVE-2016-6662 - MySQL Remote Root Code Execution /
 Privilege Escalation ( 0day )

Hi Alexander,

I was just going to reply to your email you sent earlier.
Thanks for the feedback. I actually updated the introduction after your email.
The advisory focuses on CVE-2016-6662 vulnerability which lets users
to modify/create my.cnf files. A fix would prevent users from writing
to my.cnf config.

And yes there's a typo in the last paragraph made after a few
sleepless nights ;) I've fixed it now.

The CVE-2016-6663 is not public yet. I refer to it in the advisory to
give some heads up in case someone wanted to discard this issue based
on reasoning that FILE privs are not common and that they will never
be pwned etc. It'll soon be published then it'll be clear what this
CVEID is about ;)

Cheers.
