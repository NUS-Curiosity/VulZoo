Subject: GraphicsMagick 1.3.25 fixes some security issues

Yesterday GraphicsMagick 1.3.25 was released.  It fixes several 
security issues:

1. A last instance of CVE-2016-2317 (heap buffer overflow) in the MVG 
rendering code (also impacts SVG).  This problem was originally 
reported by Gustavo Grieco.

2. A possible heap overflow of the EscapeParenthesis() function. 
While I was not able to reproduce it for myself, the implementation is 
replaced with a different algorithm.  This problem was reported by 
Gustavo Grieco.

3. The Utah RLE reader did not validate that header information was 
reasonable given the file size and so it could cause huge memory 
allocations and/or consume huge amounts of CPU.  This problem was 
reported by Agostino Sarubbo.

4. The TIFF reader had a bug pertaining to use of TIFFGetField() when 
a 'count' value is returned.  The bug caused a heap read overflow (due 
to using strlcpy() to copy a possibly unterminated string) which could 
allow an untrusted file to crash the software.

The project appreciates the time and effort that various security 
researchers have expended to identify security issues with the 
software so that they may be fixed.
