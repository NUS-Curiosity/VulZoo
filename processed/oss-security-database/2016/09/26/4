-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> An information disclosure vulnerability in the buf.pl script
> 
> https://irssi.org/2016/09/22/buf.pl-update/
> https://bugs.debian.org/838762
> https://github.com/irssi/scripts.irssi.org/commit/f1b1eb154baa684fad5d65bf4dff79c8ded8b65a

>>> This patch sets a safer umask of 077 for the scrollbuffer dump, and will
>>> remove the temporary file after use to further reduce the attack surface.

>> Other users on the same machine may be able to retrieve the whole
>> window contents after /UPGRADE when the buf.pl script is loaded.
>> Furthermore, this dump of the windows contents is never removed
>> afterwards.
>>
>> Since buf.pl is also an Irssi core script and we recommended its use
>> to retain your window content, many people could potentially be
>> affected by this.

>> buf.pl restores the scrollbuffer between upgrades by writing the
>> contents to a file, and reading that after the new process was
>> spawned. Through that file, the contents of (private) chat
>> conversations may leak to other users.
>>
>> Mitigating facts
>>
>> Careful users with a limited umask (e.g. 077) are not affected by this
>> bug.  However, most Linux systems default to a umask of 022, meaning
>> that files written without further restricting the permissions, are
>> readable by any user.

Use CVE-2016-7553.
