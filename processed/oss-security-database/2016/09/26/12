Hi Hanno,


so, in that case a the CVE should be rejected, with regard to the
old CVE.

    Use CVE-2016-7554.


I don't think this is any vuln.

This is a warning message from ffmpeg itself, not from any memory
safety tool. Thus I interpret this as "this file is garbled and would
overread if we'd do what the file offsets indicate".

It probably indicated a bug that Michal originally found with this
file, but that happened long ago. The file is from Dec 2014 (looks like
this [1]).
