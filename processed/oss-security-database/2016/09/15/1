It only means that the CVE Team at MITRE is not in an optimal position
to decide whether a CVE ID should exist for a specific library issue
that's exploitable only when application code has used that library in
a "not recommended" way. It's best for a maintainer to suggest what
outcome they prefer, e.g., "it's not recommended but people still can
use ADOdb that way; thus, we consider this a required security fix."

Because "security" is still present in the title and labels of 226,
we're making the conclusion that this is a security problem and
assigning an ID, CVE-2016-7405.

The current situation is that the CVE Team at MITRE receives both the
oss-security messages and the https://cveform.mitre.org form output.
We let people choose either method for obtaining a CVE ID from us,
depending on their disclosure goals, their perspective about open
pre-assignment discussion, or other factors. People using
https://cveform.mitre.org are free to forward our replies to
oss-security if they're relevant to the list, e.g.,
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/09/08/14 did this.
