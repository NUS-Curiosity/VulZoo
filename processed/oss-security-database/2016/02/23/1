CVE-2015-5256: Apache Cordova vulnerable to improper application of
whitelist restrictions on Android

Severity: Low

Versions Affected:
Cordova Android with whitelist functionality

Description:

Android applications created using Apache Cordova that use a remote server
contain a vulnerability where whitelist restrictions for urls using
protocols http and https are not properly applied.  Whitelist cannot block
network redirects from a whitelisted remote website to a non-whitelisted
website.

Upgrade path:

There is no specific software patch for this vulnerability. Developers that
are concerned about this should make sure to only whitelist trusted
websites, and make sure that whitelisted websites don’t redirect to a
malicious website.
Developers using should also use SSL, as well as Content Security
Policy(CSP) to further mitigate this issue. It’s always recommended for
developers to upgrade to the latest version of Cordova Android.
