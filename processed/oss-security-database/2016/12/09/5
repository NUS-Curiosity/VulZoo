Subject: CVE Request: MCabber: remote attackers can modify the roster and
 intercept messages via a crafted roster-push IQ stanza

Hi

Sam Whited discovered that MCabber versions 1.0.3 and before, was
vulnerable to an attack identical to Gajim's CVE-2015-8688 [1] which
can lead to a malicious actor MITMing a conversation, or adding
themselves as an entity on a third parties roster (thereby granting
themselves the associated priviledges such as observing when the user
is online).

The issue was fixed in the 1.0.4 release, with patch found at [2].

Can a CVE be assigned for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
