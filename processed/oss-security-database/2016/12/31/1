CVE-2016-6793: Apache Wicket deserialization vulnerability

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected: Apache Wicket 6.x and 1.5.x

Description: Depending on the ISerializer set in the Wicket
application, it's possible that a Wicket's object deserialized from an
untrusted source and utilized by the application to causes the code to
enter in an infinite loop. Specifically, Wicket's DiskFileItem class,
serialized by Kryo, allows an attacker to hack its serialized form to
put a client on an infinite loop if the client attempts to write on
the DeferredFileOutputStream attribute.

Mitigation: Upgrade to Apache Wicket 6.25.0 or 1.5.17
