Just a heads up on CVE-2016-9576.

Ben Hutchings (Cc'ed) noticed that whilst the originally identified
commit does partly address the issue, the completed fix for the sg and
bsg driver appears to be 128394eff343fc6d2f32172f03e24829539c5835.

https://git.kernel.org/linus/128394eff343fc6d2f32172f03e24829539c5835

In Debian for the upcoming kernel updates for 3.16.x in Jessie and
3.2.x in Wheezy, thus the above was used to address CVE-2016-9576.

https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/kernel/linux.git/commit/?h=jessie&id=160c700612e57b2939fda763430e08dd089b2496
https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/kernel/linux.git/commit/?h=wheezy-security&id=d8cef48e69ba67583c1fc2ec8953538218054cfe

This might raise the question if we need two CVE assignments per the
two commits, or just keeping the one assigned CVE to identify the
issue?

Salvatore
