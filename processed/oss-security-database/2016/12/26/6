Subject: Re: [security] PHPMailer < 5.2.18 Remote Code
 Execution [CVE-2016-10033]

The Drupal Security team is going to release a PSA on this topic, we
don't normally do it, but given the holiday we will issue PSA-004, in
about 30 min.

The text is below.

Thanks,
Michael on behalf of the Drupal Security Team.



Posted by Drupal Security Team on December 26, 2016 at 12:50pm

Advisory ID: DRUPAL-SA-PSA-2016-004
Project: PHPMailer (third-party library)
Version: 7.x, 8.x
Date: 2016-December-26
Security risk: 23/25 (Highly Critical)
AC:None/A:User/CI:All/II:All/E:Exploit/TD:All
Vulnerability: Arbitrary PHP code execution

Description

The PHPMailer and SMTP modules (and maybe others) add support for
sending e-mails using the 3rd party PHPMailer library.

In general the Drupal project does not create advisories for 3rd party
libraries. Drupal site maintainers should pay attention to the
notifications provided by those 3rd party libraries as outlined in
PSA-2011-002 - External libraries and plugins. However, given the
extreme criticality of this issue and the timing of its release we are
issuing a Public Service Announcement to alert potentially affected
Drupal site maintainers.

CVE identifier(s) issued

CVE-2016-10033

Versions affected

All versions of the external PHPMailer library < 5.2.18.

Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed
PHPMailer third party library, there is nothing you need to do.

Solution

Upgrade to the newest version of the phpmailler library.
