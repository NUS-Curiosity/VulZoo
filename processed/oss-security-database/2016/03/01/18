If a vendor is announcing a security update that removes SSLv2
support, they can map to any CVE IDs associated with the SSLv2
protocol to indicate their motivation for that security update. For
example, they can list CVE-2016-0800 in their advisory. If anyone is
discussing the security properties of a product (even before such an
update is announced), they can mention that -- for example --
CVE-2016-0800 is applicable to that product. If a vendor really wants
to emphasize that they are removing SSLv2 support for multiple
unspecified reasons, then the CVE team at MITRE could assign a
separate CVE ID; however, it doesn't seem especially helpful to have
that widespread risk of overlapping IDs as a default position.

CVE-2016-0800 will be in the mentioned dictionary on the CVE web site
very soon, indicating that it is a vulnerability in the SSLv2 protocol
(the https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-0800
text will be used initially). Anyone building a vulnerability database
on top of CVE can feel free to populate that database's CVE-2016-0800
entry with an arbitrarily comprehensive product list, to help with the
"track which products are using SSLv2" goal that you mentioned. CVE is
not a vulnerability database, and generally has not offered
comprehensive product mappings for protocol-level vulnerabilities.
