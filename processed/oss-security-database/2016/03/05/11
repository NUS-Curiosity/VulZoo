Subject: Re: Missing fixes for CVEs in upstream dcraw

Thanks for the answer.

It is a rather odd decision to ignore an existing fix for
CVE-2013-1438. This also means that dcraw cannot be used when any
untrusted person has access (or he can DoS a service).

Rene Rebe, is it possible to disable dcraw support in the
perl/php/python bindings of exactimage to work around this problem on
webservices?
