>> Versions affected

>>    Prepopulate 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.1.

Use CVE-2016-3187 for the issue associated with deleting the
"parse_str(base64_decode($_REQUEST['pp']), $_REQUEST);" lines, and use
CVE-2016-3188 for the issue associated with changing the value of
$limited_types. (The 16cdb63cc3b256dd785e029ec17f92ddf80cc443 commit
message does not seem closely related to the
16cdb63cc3b256dd785e029ec17f92ddf80cc443 code changes.)

Our understanding is that the Prepopulate module was packaged in, for
example, Fedora 23. The prepopulate-6.x-2.2.tar.gz file shipped in
drupal6-prepopulate-2.2-4.fc23.src.rpm apparently does not have the
16cdb63cc3b256dd785e029ec17f92ddf80cc443 changes. Thus, we feel that
the best available information is that CVE-2016-3187 and CVE-2016-3188
affects or affected, at least, Fedora 23.

(For example, see the
http://fedora.mirror.lstn.net/releases/23/Everything/source/SRPMS/d/drupal6-prepopulate-2.2-4.fc23.src.rpm
package file.)

(We understand that Drupal 6 end-of-life was last month according to
the https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol post. We also understand that
http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/drupal6-prepopulate.git/commit?id=d77963c300289b6be29b5dc08d0662fc698068f4
exists. However, drupal6-prepopulate-2.2-4.fc23 may still be in use on
many Fedora 23 systems.)

We may be sending a separate reply about the USASearch, Google
Analytics Counter, Hubspot CTA, Node Notify, and Fieldable Panels
Panes issues.
