We're going to approach this one in the same way as the issue that was
later assigned CVE-2016-2847.

Specifically, is there anyone who believes
3d44d51bd339766f0178f0cf2e8d048b4a4872aa must not have a CVE ID?

The situation, very roughly, seems to be that the upstream vendor has
announced that the behavior is a bug. CLAC occurs at a correct place
for some types of entries, but accidentally did not occur at a correct
place in the case of entries through the int80 gate. Consequently,
exploits of kernel vulnerabilities can cause more damage in some
cases.

However, it seems to be a bug in how the kernel responds to a
post-exploitation attack pattern. This is not a topic area that
commonly has CVE ID assignments. Access by the kernel to a user space
page is not an action that "crosses a privilege boundary" in a
traditional sense.
