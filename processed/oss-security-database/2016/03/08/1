Please be advised that ISC announced a security advisory for a
vulnerability in the ISC DHCP servers.

CVE-2016-2774 is a denial-of-service vector which can be exploited
against running ISC DHCP servers by opening (and never closing) a large
number of TCP connections to the ports the server is using for
inter-process communication.
