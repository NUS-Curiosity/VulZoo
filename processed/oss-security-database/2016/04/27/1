Subject: CVE-2016-0723: Linux kernel: Kernel memory disclosure.

A flaw was discovered in the linux kernel tty subsystem which allows
for disclosure of uncontrolled memory location and possible kernel
panic. The information leak is caused by a race condition when
attempting to set and read the tty line discipline.

An attacker can use the TIOCSETD (via tty_set_ldisc ) to switch to a
new line discipline, a concurrent call to with a TIOCGETD ioctl
performs a read on a given tty may be able to access memory previously
 allocated.  Up to 4 bytes may leaked to userspace when querying the
line discipline.

Thanks,
