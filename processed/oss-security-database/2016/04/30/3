This version of librsvg is still deployed in Ubuntu (trusty) and Debian
(wheezy). Imagemagick is using librsvg2 so a vulnerability there can affect
even when you receive an untrusted image.  Also, Evolution was rendering
SVG attached images:

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=361540

(this bug is quite old and it is fixed, hopefully Evolution is not
rendering SVG images using librsvg now)

Most likely yes. It is also related with CVE-2015-7558, which was fixed
here:

https://git.gnome.org/browse/librsvg/commit/?id=a51919f7e1ca9c535390a746fbf6e28c8402dc61

The only way to know for sure is to use git-bisect. I can only advise to
upgrade to 2.40.15 where all these issues are solved.
