Subject: CVE-2016-4470: Linux kernel Uninitialized variable in request_key
 handling user controlled kfree().

Gday,

A flaw was found in the Linux kernels keyring handling code, where in
key_reject_and_link() there's an uninitialised variable that isn't set
by __key_link_begin() on the destination keyring if that function
fails.

If a destination keyring was supplied, then __key_link_end() is called
whether or not __key_link_begin() succeeded, with the result that the
edit pointers contains members which end up being freed.   These are
the user controlled addresses that can exist from previous memory
contents.

Thanks,
