The "out of bounds memory read" seems to be a valid concern, and is
assigned the CVE-2016-5687 ID. However, we do not happen to understand
why 791aa82c8064ee8965a63ccf4384f56b95057e5b is a fix.

As far as we can tell, this can be thought of as a single issue in
which some type of input validation (associated with a SetImageExtent
return-value check) occurred in the wrong place, and was accompanied
by incorrect error handling. The various write-access observations
would then be consequences of this.

Use CVE-2016-5688 for this entire report about the WPG parser.

As far as we can tell, there are three separate issues identified in
the fix. (These do not necessarily map directly to the three samples.)

Use CVE-2016-5689 for the lack of required NULL pointer checks.

Use CVE-2016-5690 for the error in the for statement in the "Compute
pixel scaling table" part of the ReadDCMImage function.

Use CVE-2016-5691 for the lack of validation of pixel.red,
pixel.green, and pixel.blue.
