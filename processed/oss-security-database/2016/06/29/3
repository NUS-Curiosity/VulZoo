Subject: CVE Request: uclibc-ng (and uclibc): ARM arch: code execution

Hi all,

u-clibc and uclibc-ng is used in several projects[4, 5].

As described here[3], an attacker that controls the length parameter of
the `memset' can also control the value of the PC register. The issue is
similar to CVE-2011-2702. A patch has been proposed for uclibc-ng[1]. A
denial of service proof of concept is available[2].

Thanks,
Lucian
