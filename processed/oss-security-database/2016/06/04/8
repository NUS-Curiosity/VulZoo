Subject: three vulnerabilities in ImageMagick before 7.0.1-2

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

In case anyone needs background information about:

  https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4562
  https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4563
  https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-4564

The person who requested these CVE IDs from MITRE provided a security
advisory showing three independent problems (also with quite different
attack methodologies) that each happens to have a resultant buffer
overflow. However, they do not plan to make their security advisory
public. The CVE descriptions are based only on the surface-level
code-change information that is public in GitHub. For open-source
software, it is relatively rare for someone to compose a detailed
advisory about multiple CVEs and keep it permanently non-public, but
this can happen. One of the effects of non-public advisories is that
the number of CVEs may seem unrelated to the commit message.
