Subject: Re: CVE-2016-2178: OpenSSL DSA follows a non-constant
 time codepath for certain operations

Hi,

the openssl team usually announces those LOW issues together with the other
issues during their semi regular advisories.

(And usually as soon as these LOW CVE issues are getting added to git, a
new advisory is not far away.)

Ciao, Marcus
