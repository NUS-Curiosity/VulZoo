Are you talking about the SSH target?

If so, the realistic scenario is a user with legitimate credentials
logging into a server to steal the DSA host key locally with cache
timings.

I don't think client-side enters into the equation for this vuln. You
need an active attacker initiating handshakes. That's my 2c -- we
didn't consider client-side victim much in this work.

If it's the TLS target, you need local access or manage to co-locate
in cloud scenarios. Not as realistic as the SSH case IMO.
