1)
SECURITY-85 / CVE-2016-4986:

The plugin did not correctly filter a parameter and allowed reading 
arbitrary files on the file system.


2)
SECURITY-278 / CVE-2016-4987:
Path traversal vulnerability in Image Gallery Plugin

The plugin did not correctly validate form fields and allowed listing 
arbitrary directories and reading arbitrary files on the file system.


3)
SECURITY-290 / CVE-2016-4988:
Cross-site scripting vulnerability in Build Failure Analyzer Plugin

The plugin did not escape a parameter echoed on an HTML page, resulting in a 
reflected XSS vulnerability.


4)
SECURITY-305 / CVE-2013-7397 and CVE-2013-7398:
Async HTTP Client Plugin does not properly validate certificates

Async HTTP Client Plugin provides the Async HTTP Client Java library to 
other plugins. It is based on the 1.7.x line of AHC, which by default is 
vulnerable to CVE-2013-7397 and CVE-2013-7398, allowing man-in-the-middle 
attacks. The fixes for these vulnerabilities were backported.
