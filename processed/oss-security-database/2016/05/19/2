CVE-2016-3728: remote code execution in Foreman smart proxy TFTP API

The Foreman smart proxy TFTP API is vulnerable to arbitrary remote code
execution, as it passes untrusted user input (the PXE template type) to
the eval() function causing it to be executed.

Thanks to Lukas Zapletal for reporting the issue to foreman-security.

Mitigation: ensure trusted_hosts is set in
/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.yml, HTTPS is in use and
/etc/foreman-proxy/settings.d/tftp.yml is configured for https only (if
enabled).

Affects Foreman 0.2 and higher
Fix released in Foreman 1.11.2, and due for 1.10.4

Patch:
https://github.com/theforeman/smart-proxy/commit/eef532aa668d656b9d61d9c6edf7c2505f3f43c7
