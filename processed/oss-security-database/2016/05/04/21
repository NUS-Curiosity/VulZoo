Use CVE-2000-1254. The commit is:
https://git.openssl.org/?p=openssl.git;a=commit;h=db82b8f9bd432a59aea8e1014694e15fc457c2bb

(We are not sure how this CVE ID would be used. It is possible that
nobody will use this ID for OpenSSL risk management, but someone will
use this ID in deciding to pursue further research on "shifting more
than the size of an expression" issues.)

If this ID is sent in an oss-security followup, the Subject: header
should be changed to mention OpenSSL. Also, MITRE currently plans to
publish the CVE for this along with the CVEs for the OpenSSL
2016-05-03 issues, which should be very soon.
