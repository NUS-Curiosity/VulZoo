Subject: CVE-2016-3091 Diego log encoding vulnerability

Title: CVE-2016-3091 Diego log encoding vulnerability

Severity: High

Vendor: Cloud Foundry Foundation

Versions Affected: Diego-release versions 0.1468.0 through 0.1470.0

Description: Due to how Diego handles breaking up large log streams on UTF-8 boundaries, it is possible to cause a denial of service on a Cloud Foundry installation with an app outputting malformed UTF-8 sequences.

Affected Cloud Foundry Products and Versions: Diego-release versions 0.1468.0 through 0.1470.0

Mitigation: The Cloud Foundry project recommends that Cloud Foundry Deployments running Diego versions 0.1468.0 through 0.1470.0 upgrade to Diego version 0.1471.0.

Credit: This issue was identified by a Pivotal team and reported responsibly to the Cloud Foundry Foundation.
