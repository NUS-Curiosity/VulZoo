Use CVE-2014-9773. We don't completely understand issues/397. We think
"This is rejected for Atheme, please consider reporting it to a
downstream fork instead" means that the vulnerability report was
originally rejected, but that decision was reconsidered many months
later.


> Fix:
> https://github.com/atheme/atheme/commit/87580d767868360d2fed503980129504da84b63e
> Description: Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could cause
> denial of service due to a buffer overflow in the XMLRPC response
> encoding code.

Use CVE-2016-4478.


(Incidentally, our understanding is that this code, or at least related
code, is available in the Debian atheme-services package.)
