Subject: Re: OpenSSL Security Advisory [3rd May 2016]

My current view on three of the issues:

* Padding oracle in AES-NI CBC MAC check (CVE-2016-2107)
The advisory says: "This issue was introduced as part of the fix for
Lucky 13 padding attack (CVE-2013-0169)".
So the following versions should be affected (ref.
https://openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#y2013):
 - 1.0.2 through 1.02g
 - 1.0.1d through 1.0.1s
 - 1.0.0k and all later versions
 - 0.9.8y and all later versions

* ASN.1 BIO excessive memory allocation (CVE-2016-2109)
The OpenSSL code history tells that the vulnerable code is also in the
0.9.8 and 1.0.0 lines --> affected

* EBCDIC overread (CVE-2016-2176)
The OpenSS code history tells that the vulnerable code is also in the
0.9.8 and 1.0.0 lines --> affected
(btw: curious about where there are still EBCDIC systems that use
OpenSSL and are interested in fixing vulnerabilities...?)
