Use CVE-2016-4553.

Use CVE-2016-4555 for the vulnerability in client_side_request.cc -
here, "if (aConn)" was added.

Use CVE-2016-4556 for the vulnerability in Esi.cc - it is
described as "was being unlocked without having been locked."

As far as we can tell, this does not really mean that there is an
additional vulnerability in 3.5.17 that did not exist in 4.0.9.
Instead, it means that the vulnerabilities are the same, but in 3.5.x
people might notice the vulnerabilities being exploited accidentally.

This means, for example, that the URLs work if one manually locates
all instances of www.squid-cache.org and inserts www1.jp.squid-cache.org
instead. See http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html
for other options.
