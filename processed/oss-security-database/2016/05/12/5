The patch which fixes the gplt vector also fixes a related vector in gs.
The lack of -dSAFER when invoking Ghostscript allows for arbitrary
file read/write. Sander Bos noticed that ImageMagick isn't affected
by this bug. Given that the -dSAFER bug is specific to GraphicsMagick,
I think a separate CVE should be assigned.
