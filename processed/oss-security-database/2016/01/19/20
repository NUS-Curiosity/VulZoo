Subject: CVE-2015-8705: Problems converting OPT resource records and ECS
 options to text format can cause BIND to terminate.

CVE:                   CVE-2015-8705
Document Version:      2.0
Posting date:          19 January 2016
Program Impacted:      BIND
Versions affected:     9.10.0->9.10.3-P2
Severity:              Medium
Exploitable:           Remotely

Description:

   In versions of BIND 9.10, errors can occur when OPT pseudo-RR
   data or ECS options are formatted to text.  In 9.10.3 through
   9.10.3-P2, the issue may result in a REQUIRE assertion failure
   in buffer.c. In prior 9.10 versions, it may result in named
   crashing (such as with a segmentation fault) or other misbehavior
   due to a buffer overrun.

Impact:

   This issue can affect both authoritative and recursive servers
   if they are performing debug logging. (It may also crash related
   tools which use the same code, such as dig or delv.)

CVSS Score:            5.4
CVSS Vector:           (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)

Workarounds:

   CVE-2015-8705 can be avoided in named by disabling debug logging.

Active exploits:

   No known active exploits.

Solution:

   Upgrade to the patched release most closely related to your
