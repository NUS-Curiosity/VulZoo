Subject: CVE-2015-8704: Specific APL data could trigger an INSIST in apl_42.c
 causing BIND named to exit

CVE:                   CVE-2015-8704
Document Version:      2.0
Posting date:          19 January 2016
Program Impacted:      BIND
Versions affected:     9.3.0->9.8.8, 9.9.0->9.9.8-P2,
                       9.9.3-S1->9.9.8-S3, 9.10.0->9.10.3-P2
Severity:              High
Exploitable:           Remotely

Description:

   A buffer size check used to guard against overflow could cause
   named to exit with an INSIST failure In apl_42.c.

Impact:

   A server could exit due to an INSIST failure in apl_42.c when
   performing certain string formatting operations.  Examples include
   (but may not be limited to):

    -  Slaves using text-format db files could be vulnerable if
       receiving a malformed record in a zone transfer from their master.

    -  Masters using text-format db files could be vulnerable if
       they accept a malformed record in a DDNS update message.

    -  Recursive resolvers are potentially vulnerable when debug
       logging, if they are fed a deliberately malformed record by
       a malicious server.

    -  A server which has cached a specially constructed record
       could encounter this condition while performing 'rndc dumpdb'.

Please Note:

   Versions of BIND from 9.3 through 9.8 are also affected, but
   these branches are beyond their "end of life" (EOL) and no longer
   receive testing or security fixes from ISC. For current information
   on which versions are actively supported, please see
