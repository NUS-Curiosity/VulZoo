Subject: [OSSA 2016-003] Heat denial of service through template-validate
 (CVE-2015-5295)

===============================================================
OSSA-2016-003: Heat denial of service through template-validate
===============================================================

:Date: January 19, 2016
:CVE: CVE-2015-5295


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Heat: <=2015.1.2, ==5.0.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Steven Hardy from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Heat template
validation. By referencing a local file like /dev/zero, an
authenticated user may trick the heat engine service to load arbitrary
local file content resulting in a Denial of Service attack through
memory exhaustion. Note that the file content is not written back to
the user, though the user can determine if a file exists and if it is
readable by heat-engine. All Heat setups are affected.
