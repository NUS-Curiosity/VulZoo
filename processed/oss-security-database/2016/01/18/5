That entirely depends on how the data is read or written.  glibc will
make additional copies on the heap in some cases.  In any case, this is
an implementation detail.

Even if the data is gone from the process image, the kernel or its
hypervisor may still keep copies, particularly if the data is (or was
once) on the file system.  It is very hard to override data reliably on
modern systems.
