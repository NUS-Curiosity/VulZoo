Subject: [OSSA 2016-004] Swift proxy-server DoS through Large Object
 (CVE-2016-0737, CVE-2016-0738)

==========================================================
OSSA-2016-004: Swift proxy-server DoS through Large Object
==========================================================

:Date: January 20, 2016
:CVE: CVE-2016-0737 (client to proxy), CVE-2016-0738 (proxy to server)


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Swift: >=2.2.1 <= 2.3.0, >= 2.4.0 <= 2.5.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Romain LE DISEZ from OVH and Örjan Persson from Kiliaro independently
reported two vulnerabilities in Swift Large Object. By repeatedly
requesting and interrupting connections to a Large Object (Dynamic or
Static) URL, a remote attacker may exhausts Swift proxy-server
resources, potentially resulting in a denial of service. Note that
there are two distinct bugs that can exhaust proxy resources, one for
client connection (client to proxy), one for servers connection (proxy
to server). All Swift setup are affected.

Notes
~~~~~

- The remaining fix will be included in future 2.3.1 (Kilo) and 2.5.1
  (Liberty) releases.
