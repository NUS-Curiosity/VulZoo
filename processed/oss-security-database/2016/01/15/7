This is not directly related to the Qualys advisory, but the 7.1p2 OpenSSH
releases [1] fixes another vulnerability, could CVE be assigned?

SECURITY: Fix an out of-bound read access in the packet handling code.
Reported by Ben Hawkes [2]

There's also a fix [3] related to X11 forwarding which seems different than
the fix which went into OpenSSH 6.9 [4,5]. I'm not sure if it deserves a CVE
or not.
