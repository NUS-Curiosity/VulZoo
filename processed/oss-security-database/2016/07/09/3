> Issue:       https://sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=3510

>> 1. Create a large file, for example `dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/1GB bs=1M count=1000`
>> 2. Open new mail in SOGo, try to attach large file
>> 3. If attachment fails, some memory gets freed, but not all of it
>> 4. Repeat 1-3 until server crashes
 
> The issues was resolved by limiting the upload size ...
> 
> Further investigation showed that not memcached was the issue but
> temporary files kept around
