Use CVE-2016-6261.

There is no CVE ID for a memory leak. The memory leak was a
consequence of the original fix, and was eliminated minutes later
during development.


> ** idn: Solve out-of-bounds-read when reading one zero byte as input.
> Also replaced fgets with getline. Reported by Hanno Boeck

idn is described at
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/libidn.git/tree/src/idn.c as "Command
line interface to the internationalized domain name library." An
out-of-bounds read in a command-line program is not always security
relevant. Also, msg00009.html lists the various items as "Noteworthy
changes" and not specifically as security fixes. We think you might
mean that someone can use idn to convert a file, and then send the
converted file to an untrusted party. If there is an out-of-bounds
read, then the converted file might include arbitrary data from
process memory.

Use CVE-2015-8948.

> http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/libidn.git/commit/?id=5e3cb9c7b5bf0ce665b9d68f5ddf095af5c9ba60

Use CVE-2016-6262.
