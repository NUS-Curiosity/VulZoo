Subject: CVE-2016-6160: Segmentation fault in tcprewrite (tcpreplay)

Hello,

as already reported in Debian BTS#829350, the tcprewrite program, part
of the tcpreplay suite, does not check the size of the frames it
processes. Huge frames may trigger a segmentation fault, and they
occur on interfaces with an MTU of or close to 65536. For example, the
loopback interface lo of the Linux kernel has such a value.

This has been assigned CVE-2016-6160.

The Debian BTS also contains a fix.

    Christoph
