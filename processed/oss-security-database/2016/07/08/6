It's hard to do that when a "surprise" CVE was never sent to the project,
for example  *CVE*-*2016*-*3751*(H) which just appeared in an Android
security
bulletin.  It claims that libpng has a bug that allows privilidge escalation
and was reported 3 Dec 2015. I'm guessing that it is a duplicate of
CVE-2015-8126 or CVE-2015-8472, but it's hard to tell for sure without
seeing it.  All I've been able to find out is that it is a "reserved" CVE,
with
no clue as to who reserved it.
