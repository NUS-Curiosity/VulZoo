Use CVE-2016-7091. The scope of this CVE is the entire 'INPUTRC should
not be included in "env_keep" at all, or else somehow restricted'
problem, which has both the information disclosure and segmentation
fault outcomes.

If there is a reason that this must also be considered a vulnerability
in readline, please let us know. For example, maybe there are other
common programs that accept an INPUTRC environment variable over the
network during a login session for an authenticated attacker who is
only supposed to be able to execute a single command. Suppose that
this attacker can also create files beginning with $include (e.g., by
writing to a shared filesystem or using FTP upload). The unlimited
include level might allow much more resource consumption than
intended. Another possibility is that the INPUTRC environment variable
could specify a file that should not be read by this type of
restricted account, e.g., the /dev/zero file. However, we do not know
of a realistic attack scenario in which readline would be considered
the vulnerable software. There are no other CVE IDs -- either for
readline or for any other software -- at this time.
