OpenSSH upstream dos not consider this as a security issue btw.

It seems the only thing the attacker could do here, is self-dos his own
connection. Regarding consuming memory on the server, by opening several
concurrent connections at the same time, there are various protections
available in opensshd_config file, such as "MaxStartups", which can
limit the maximum number of sessions per network connections.

This value is effectively set to 10:30:100 so maximum of 100 * 128 MB
can be allocated, which is pretty much for unauthenticated user. Though
the rate limiting starts to drop connection after 10, which is like 1GB
and which should not hurt the server (though it is not cool).
