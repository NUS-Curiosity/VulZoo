Subject: Re: CVE-2016-6662 - MySQL Remote Root Code Execution /
 Privilege Escalation ( 0day )

Dawid meanwhile updated his post [1] to reflect that the fixes for
CVE-2016-6662 were added in 5.5.52/5.6.33/5.7.15.
... But today Oracle states that those versions were still affected [2],
thus the fix releases are 5.5.53/5.6.34/5.7.16.

So which one is correct? Based on the changelogs I assume [1].

And btw, Dawid: what happened with CVE-2016-6663? Still not public yet?
