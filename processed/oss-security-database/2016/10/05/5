Subject: CVE-2016-7903: Dotclear <= 2.10.2 Password Reset Address Spoof

Vulnerability: Dotclear <= 2.10.2 Password Reset Address Spoof
CVE: CVE-2016-7903
Discovered by: Hongkun Zeng (http://www.dbappsecurity.com.cn/)


Dotclear is an open source blog publishing application distributed under the GNU GPLv2.


The vulnerability can be triggered only if the Host header is not part of the web server routing process (e.g. if several domains are served by the same web server). This can lead to phishing attacks because of the modification of the site's links. (A remote unauthenticated attacker can change the host in reset password address.)
