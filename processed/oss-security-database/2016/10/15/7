Subject: dcraw and CVE-2015-8366 + CVE-2015-8367

Hi Dave,

I was wondering if you could comment on whether dcraw is affected by these
2 CVEs and whether new versions have been released which remove the
vulnerability?

I noticed you mentioned in the mailing list post below that "CVE-2015-8366
will be fixed in v9.27" - did that end up getting fixed in 9.27? How about
CVE-2015-83667?
