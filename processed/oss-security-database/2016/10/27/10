CVE-2016-6794 Apache Tomcat System Property Disclosure

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M9
Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.4

Description
When a SecurityManager is configured, a web application's ability to
read system properties should be controlled by the SecurityManager.
Tomcat's system property replacement feature for configuration files
could be used by a malicious web application to bypass the
SecurityManager and read system properties that should not be visible.

Mitigation
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M10 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.5 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.0.37 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.72 or later
  (Apache Tomcat 7.0.71 has the fix but was not released)
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 6.0.47 or later
  (Apache Tomcat 6.0.46 has the fix but was not released)
