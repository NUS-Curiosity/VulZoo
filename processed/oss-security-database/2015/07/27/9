Whatever happened to the half-life of vulnerabilities?

From
https://community.qualys.com/blogs/laws-of-vulnerabilities/2015/01/27/the-ghost-vulnerability
:

"Where can I download the exploit?

We want to give everyone enough time to patch. According to our data once
the vulnerability has reached its half-life we will release the exploit.
Half-life is the time interval measuring a reduction of a vulnerabilityâ€™s
occurrence by half. Over time, this metric shows how successful efforts
have been to eradicate vulnerability. A shorter half-life indicates faster
remediation. Half-life was originally coined by Qualys in the Laws of
Vulnerability."
