Subject: Security issue in Linux Kernel Keyring (CVE-2015-1333)

While improving the system call coverage in stress-ng[1], Colin Ian King
discovered a bug in the Linux kernel keyring that can be used to cause a
local denial of service due to memory exhaustion when the same key is
repeatedly added to the kernel keyring via the add_key() syscall.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2015-1333.

I've attached the fix since I don't yet have an upstream git commit
hash.
