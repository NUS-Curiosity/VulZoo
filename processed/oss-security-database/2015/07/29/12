All -

Let's end this thread here - I mean the topic of (not) releasing a
(weaponized) exploit at the same time with advisory.  All the major
opinions have been stated already.

So far, we rejected only one posting to this thread - it consisted of
the single word "Seconded." in support of one of the opinions.  Thus,
everyone had ample opportunity to state their opinion (except merely
"voting for" an opinion already stated).

After this point, we're going to start rejecting (likely) all or most
further postings to this thread on this same topic.  So please stop.

Thanks,

Alexander
