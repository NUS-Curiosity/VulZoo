Excellent work, Qualys!

However, this brings up the question: why didn't Red Hat do a security
audit of this software they developed before putting it into their
distros?  I think Red Hat's own security team would have spotted these
issues if it were tasked with proactive security audits of internally
developed software (or of small yet critical components like this)
rather than only(?) with security response.  (I am writing this without
knowledge of how Red Hat's security team operates internally.  I am
merely guessing.)  These are not some subtle bugs that one could easily
overlook in a large codebase.  These are clear design flaws, of the kind
we used to see found and fixed in 1990s, in small and obviously
security-critical components.

I understand there's probably more than enough security response work to
keep the existing security team 100% busy, so maybe another sub-team is
needed for this - or it can be outsourced, e.g. to Qualys or Openwall. ;-)

The recent ABRT and apport findings by Tavis Ormandy and these userhelper
and libuser findings by Qualys suggest that what's now known as Secure
Software Development Life Cycle (S-SDLC) is missing at both Red Hat and
Canonical.  Will this change?
