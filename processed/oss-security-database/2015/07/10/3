Subject: Re: Re: CVE Request: UDP checksum DoS

These two issues (CVE-2015-5366 and CVE-2015-5364) - commit in May 30th:
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=beb39db59d14990e401e235faf66a6b9b31240b0

are fixed upstream in: 3.10.81, 3.12.44, 3.14.45, 3.18.17, 4.0.6, and
4.1-rc7

Does anyone know the reason why it wasn't (yet?) included in the
latest 3.4.x release (3.4.108 as of 2015-06-19)?

Thanks,
Gsunde
