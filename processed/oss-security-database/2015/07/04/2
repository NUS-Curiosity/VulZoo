To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com,
        Assign a CVE Identifier <cve-assign@...re.org>
Subject: please REJECT CVE-2015-3199

This was assigned internally but then:

http://projects.theforeman.org/issues/10469

"This was reported by Ori Rabin to foreman-security (thanks!) and a CVE
identifier was filed under CVE-2015-3199, but it turned out this does
not affect any released upstream version."

so it was effectively in an unreleased version, thus no need for CVE.
