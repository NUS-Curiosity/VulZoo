Subject: Squid HTTP proxy CVE request

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Greetings,

This months release of Squid HTTP proxy, version 3.5.6, contains fixes
for two security issues.


Issue #1:

Due to incorrect handling of peer responses in a hierarchy of 2 or
more proxies remote clients (or scripts run on a client) are able to
gain unrestricted access through a gateway proxy to its backend proxy.

If the two proxies have differing levels of security this could lead
to authentication bypass or unprivileged access to supposedly secure
resources.

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13856.p
atch>

All Squid up to and including 3.5.5 are vulnerable.

(when published the advisory for this will be
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2015_2.txt>)


Issue #2:

This is somewhat more obscure, and I am seeking clarification perhapse
more than assignment.

Squid up to and including 3.5.5 are apparently vulnerable to DoS
attack from malicious clients using repeated TLS renegotiation
messages. This has not been verified as it also seems to require
outdated (0.9.8l and older) OpenSSL libraries.

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13849.p
atch>

CVE-2009-3555 was mentioned by the submitter, but that was clearly
assigned for server-initiated renegotiation. This Squid change is
specifically for the client-initiated renegotiation part of the TLS
protocol flaw.

There may be some relevant CVE already assigned, although I've been
unable to find it. Only CVE-2011-1473 which is for the library itself
and disputed.

So, is server software being assigned specific CVE (or a shared
generic one) for resolving this flaw? Please indicate which CVE Squid
announcements should mention (if any).


Thanks,
