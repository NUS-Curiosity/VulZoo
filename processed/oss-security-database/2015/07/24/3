So... we released within less than an hour of the CRD, the reason we
were late, ironically, is that we were waiting for Qualys to go public
(we were keeping an eye on oss-security, their blog and twitter feed),
and Qualys was waiting for us to go public before they released (we
finally asked after about 20 minutes and then it happened).

Here's something I love about Red Hat: internally we have a wide range
of views, literally the full spectrum, and we quite often debate things
internally, and even externally, both from professional and personal
perspectives (e.g. my views on embargoes actually encompass several
incompatible ideas/views, the trick is trying to find a least bad
solution that optimizes globally without completely harming various
groups/needs).

Our CEO even wrote a book about organizations full of such people =):
