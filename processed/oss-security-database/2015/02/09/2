Subject: Moodle security issue made public

Hi Kurt, we have still waited for a week after the release with the
announcing of the security issue this time but we are actively
discussing the change of process starting from the next release.

The following security notifications have now been made public. Thanks
to OSS members for their cooperation. It also looks like OSS has
accidentally issued us another identifier: CVE-2015-1493. I'm letting
you know that I have never used it in our announcements
