Subject: CVE-2015-0245: denial of service in dbus >= 1.4 systemd activation

Bug tracked as: CVE-2015-0245
Bug tracked as: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88811
Versions affected: dbus >= 1.4.0
Versions fixed: >= 1.9.10, 1.8.x >= 1.8.16, 1.6.x >= 1.6.30
Type of vulnerability: CWE-285 Improper Authorization
Exploitable by: local users
Impact: denial of service
Reporter: Simon McVittie, Collabora Ltd.

D-Bus <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/> is an
asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used
for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other
operating systems.

dbus-daemon can "activate" (auto-start) D-Bus services on-demand when it
receives a message addressed to them. In versions >= 1.4.0 of dbus, it
can do this by using a D-Bus signal to ask systemd to carry out the
actual service start.

systemd sends back an ActivationFailure D-Bus signal if the activation
fails. However, when it receives these signals, dbus-daemon does not
verify that the signal actually came from systemd. A malicious local
user could send repeated ActivationFailure signals in the hope that it
would "win the race" with the genuine signal, causing D-Bus to send back
an error to the client that requested activation.

Mitigation: the system service is not actually prevented from starting
or claiming its well-known bus name, and after it has done so,
subsequent clients can communicate with it as usual.

The recommended fix for stable distributions is to alter system.conf
similar to the attached patch (commit link below), or upgrade to version
1.8.16 or 1.6.30. This restricts the attack to uid 0, making it a
non-issue in practice.

The full solution involves additional code changes and has only been
made in the 1.9 development branch so far, but is easy to backport to
1.8 if required (e.g. for environments where uid 0 is not all-powerful
due to use of LSMs). It requires two additional commits:
