Subject: RE: Re: CVE request: XSS in MantisBT

As the initial discoverer of CVE-2014-8986, I can confirm that the commit in
e326b73a does not fix the issue reported in CVE-2014-8986.

The commit
https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/cabacdc291c251bfde0dc2a2c945c02c
ef41bf40 does fix CVE-2014-8986.

@mitre: The description @
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8986 is incorrect -
"MantisBT 1.2.13 through 1.2.17". The issue described in CVE-2014-8986 was
not fixed in either 1.2.18 or .1.2.19. How does one get the status of this
issue updated?

Thanks
Paul

It would help if you looked at the 1.2.x commit...
