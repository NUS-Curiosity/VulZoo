Subject: vsftpd problem in deny_hosts

Hi,

IBM reported to us a problem in vsftpd deny_hosts problem.

CVE-2015-1419

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=915522

Description;
 Set the option "deny_file" in /etc/vsftpd.conf on a top-directory (for example "deny_file=/home/*")
 Then log in with ftp and try to cd to "/home/" first, which will fail, then try to cd to "/./home/" which will succeed!
 The latter case shouldn't be possible as well!

Ciao, Marcus
