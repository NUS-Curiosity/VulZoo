Subject: Audit: log terminal emulator escape sequences handling CVE-2015-5186

Steve Grubb of Red Hat reports:

When auditing the filesystem the names of files are logged. These filenames
can contain escape sequences, when viewed using the ausearch programs "-i"
option for example this can result in the escape sequences being processed
unsafely by the terminal program being used to view the data.

This has been corrected upstream with the following commit:
https://fedorahosted.org/audit/changeset/1122

Easy workaround: don't use really old terminals/rxvt/etc that are
vulnerable to escape sequence handling issues.
