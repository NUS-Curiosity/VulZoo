Subject: CVE-2015-5228 & CVE-2015-5231 in the criu service daemon

This is just a heads-up that a discussion about hardening the criu
service daemon is now happening upstream:

  <http://lists.openvz.org/pipermail/criu/2015-August/021847.html>

Considering impact (the service is not widely used right now), we
decided to discuss the new design in the open.  Please contribute to the
discussion on the criu mailing list if you are interested.
