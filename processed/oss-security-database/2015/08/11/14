Are all the supposedly invulnerable terminals actually safe? 
Gnome-terminal reports:

0000000: 1b5d 6c54 6572 6d69 6e61 6c1b 5c       .]lTerminal.\

That's not as bad as echoing 'ls -al' back to the terminal input, but 
why is it considered acceptable for terminals to input anything 
whatsoever in response to the in-band data they receive?
