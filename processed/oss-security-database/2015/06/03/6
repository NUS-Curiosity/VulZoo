There's another issue related to the RLE decoding. DecodeImage() does
not check that the run-length "count" fits into the total size of the
image, which can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow. I've not
assigned a CVE ID to this (mainly because I'm not sure if this
warrants a new CVE or should be bundled with CVE-2015-0848, so I leave
that up to the CVE experts on the list).

We have some possible fixes in our bug [1], but be cautious - these are
not fully vetted yet. So far, however, they look fine to me.
