Subject: Re: CVE-2015-0848 - Heap overflow on libwmf0.2-7

Stefan,

There are two additionals invalid read issues inside libwmf, I
submitted both to Debian a while ago, I don't know if they are worth
to fix on a security update. One of them has a patch by me (not
heavily tested though)

invalid read on meta_pen_create player/meta.h (+ patch)
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=784205

wmf2gd/wmf2eps invalid read
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=784192

Thanks.
