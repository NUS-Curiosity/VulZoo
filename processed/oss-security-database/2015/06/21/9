Subject: Re: Yoast Wordpress SEO Plugin <= 2.1.1 Stored, Authenticated XSS

Thank you for investigating. I agree that since this was never patched there don't need to be two separate CVE identifiers, but it does seem a little odd to create a new 2012 CVE. In any case, at least it now has an identifier.

Thanks again,
Charles
