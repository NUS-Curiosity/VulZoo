Subject: Duplicate CVE: CVE-2015-7703 in NTP

Hi,

It seems that NTP upstream has also requested a CVE (and had one
assigned) for this issue:

Bug 2902 : CVE-2015-7703 configuration directives "pidfile" and "driftfile" should only be allowed locally. (RedHat) 
[http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#October_2015_NTP_Security_Vulner]

However, Red Hat assigned CVE-2015-5196 to this issue when it was first
discovered:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2015-5196

Can CVE-2015-7703 please be rejected?

Thank you!
