Subject: [CVE-2015-5215] Ipsilon: XSS in multiple pages

CVE-2015-5215: Ipsilon XSS in multiple pages

Versions affected: 0.1.0 to 1.0.0
Fixed in versions: 1.0.1, 1.1.0

Description:
It was found that the Ipsilon IdP server used the default configuration of the Jinja templating engine, which did not HTML escape template variables. This could be exploited to perform an XSS attack if a value from untrusted input was used in the template and rendered in the user`s browser.

Mitigation:
Users of Ipsilon should update to version 1.0.1 or later.

Credit:
This issue was discovered by Michael Scherer of Red Hat.
