Yes, these releases were made:

http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-2.0.6.tar.gz
http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-2.1.8.tar.gz
http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/LibreSSL/libressl-2.2.4.tar.gz

The fixes are spread over several commits, so the combined diff is
probably the easiest place to look:

http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/5.8/common/007_obj2txt.patch.sig
