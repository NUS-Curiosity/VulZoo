Subject: [OSSA 2015-020] Glance storage overrun (CVE-2015-5286)

=====================================
OSSA-2015-020: Glance storage overrun
=====================================

:Date: October 01, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2015-5286


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Glance: <=2014.2.3, >=2015.1.0, <=2015.1.1


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Mike Fedosin and Alexei Galkin from Mirantis reported a vulnerability
in Glance. By deleting images that are being uploaded using a token
that is about to expire, a malicious user can overcome the storage
quota and accumulate untracked image data in the backend resulting in
potential resource exhaustion and denial of service. All Glance setups
using the V1 API are affected and all setups using the V2 API with the
registry db_api enabled are affected.
