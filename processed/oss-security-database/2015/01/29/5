Well as someone who is very careful, I _would_ consider every buffer
overflow a security risk unless proven otherwise.

It's unexpected behaviour, isn't it?
It's up to the surrounding systems such as ASLR to mitigate it.
But neither is ASLR deployed everywhere, nor is it a silver bullet
to solve the problem.

But I don't want to really reiterate this discussion.
All possible opinions on this topic have already been stated.
