It's not related, and we cannot patch it at the same time because
packages for the gethostbyname issue are already ready, they just have
to be released.  (When we change critical system components, we also
need to be extra-careful with testing, which takes time.)

Andreas Schwab fixed this in 2011:

  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=2e96f1c7>

If I'm not mistaken, this commit when into glibc 2.15.

I have not yet found the corresponding glibc bug (if it exists).

The bug only materializes if the getaddrinfo functions is called with
the AI_IDN flag, and if glibc has been compiled with libidn support
(but I haven't checked if you can switch that off these days).
