We have no access to vendor list, thus we had no prior knowledge if
the fixes are ready or not.

In our opinion it is related to CVE-2015-0235 for couple of reasons.
It would be rather pointless to name them all here as someone else
still would have a different opinion, understood.

Dunno about the glibc 2.15 but the bug can be triggered with
"libc6:i386 2.13-38+deb7u7".  So again, the patches exist but the most
recent packages are affected.

Many smart and more experienced members of this list may be interested
in analyzing this bug. Maybe it's only a regular bug, which can be
considered DoS at most in some circumstances or maybe there's more
than meets the eye. Hard to tell without in-depth analysis a la Qualys
one (by the report one can see how much effort it requires to reach
that level of honesty).

Thanks Florian for an initial skim through the code.
