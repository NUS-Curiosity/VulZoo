Use CVE-2013-7423 for ths initial bug report at 2013-09-12 09:50:17 UTC 
stating: "Under high load, getaddrinfo() starts sending DNS queries to 
random file descriptors, e.g. some unrelated socket connected to a remote 
service."

Which comment says that the issue is unfixed?  The 2015-01-08 14:21:11 UTC 
comment by David Nilsson says "I'm unable to reproduce the correct 
behaviour," but does not suggest that the vulnerability is still present.
