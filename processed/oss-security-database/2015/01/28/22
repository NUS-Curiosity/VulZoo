Oh, it seems Huzaifa posted the wrong Bugzilla reference.

We still need assignment for this fix:

  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=2e96f1c7>

The matching Red Hat Bugzilla bug is:

  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=981942>

I haven't yet seen an upstream bug for it; this change happened before
upstream required bugs being filed for all user-visible changes.
