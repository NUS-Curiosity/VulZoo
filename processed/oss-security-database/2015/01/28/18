Use CVE-2012-6686 for "unbound alloca use in glob_in_dir" as covered by 
Red Hat Bugzilla ID 797096.

How is 797096 related to the 2e96f1c7 commit?  The 2e96f1c7 commit does 
not appear to be directly related to alloca usage; it concentrates on 
setting "malloc_name = true" in gaih_inet().  However, a submitted patch 
for Bugzilla 797096 
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=583711&action=diff) 
performs includes much more extensive changes to gaih_inet(), modifies 
other functions, and omits the "name = p;" logic that is used in 2e96f1c7.

Also, 797096 is marked as "closed" and points to RHBA-2013:0022-2, which 
references CVE-2013-4357, which is RH Bug 1009643, which says "glibc: 
stack overflow in getaddrinfo()'s use of alloca()."
