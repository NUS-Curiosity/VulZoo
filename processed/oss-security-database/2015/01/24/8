Thanks for the additional clarification. However, we're planning to
keep the distinct IDs of CVE-2013-7421 and CVE-2014-9644. We don't
combine issues based only on finding that they affect the same module
and have the same impact, and were fixed at roughly the same time. The
4943ba16bbc2db05115707b3ff7b4874e9e3c560 example of loading
'vfat(blowfish)' is new attack information that wasn't obvious, and
didn't become public until 20 months later.

(In this type of situation, we would prefer two CVE IDs even if
everything had been fixed in a single commit. Admittedly, if there
were a single commit, and no other information were posted, it might
have been much harder to notice that there were two discoveries. So,
there might have been the less preferable outcome of one CVE ID.)
