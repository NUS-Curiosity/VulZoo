Two CVEs are used here.

While the bugs have the same technical impact - accessing files outside of 
an intended directory - the root causes and vulnerability types are 
different.  774434 does not handle when symlink destinations point outside 
the directory.  774435 is a protection mechanism failure in which an 
attempt is made to protect against directory traversal by removing a 
leading slash, but not considering that there can be multiple leading 
slashes.
