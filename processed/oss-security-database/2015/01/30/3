FWIW, I never cared about them much.  But I do care about the confusion
and its possible negative impact:

Huh?!  IMO, no one should ever wait for a CVE before reporting an issue!

If it is possible to get a CVE assigned during an embargo period that
would exist anyway, and without disclosing the vulnerability detail to
any extra party, great!  (e.g. this happens for issues handled via the
distros list, where CVEs are currently getting assigned from Red Hat's
pool without having to inform any extra party.)  If this is not
possible, then do without CVE (and one may be assigned when the issue is
already public in here).
