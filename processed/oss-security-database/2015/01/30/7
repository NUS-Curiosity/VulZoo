I cannot help but ask: is 
https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=364511#c9 from you? 
(Sorry, I see only a partial email address there, and I cannot expand it 
for some reason.) Was it automated then?

https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=364511#c10 is from 
Tim Willis and he is from the Chrome security team, right? I'm not sure 
what you mean by "escalated" but comments #10 and #14 show that the 
Chrome security team can catch relevant issues itself (which is nice).
