Okay, maybe this was prone to misinterpretation.

I thought it more like "If I try to track all the issues where I have
requested CVEs and check whether I really got them or whether I should
ask again I'd loose time I could better use to fuzz the next library."
I don't remember actively delaying reporting or publication of a vuln
due to lack of CVEs.
