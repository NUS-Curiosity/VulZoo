Subject: Dublicate CVE assignment for directory traversal in elfutils?
 (CVE-2014-9486 and CVE-2014-9447)

Hi

while updating our tracker information at Debian i noticed that there
might be a dublicate CVE assignment for elfutils:

In

https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=142032305709528&w=2

CVE-2014-9486 was assigned for elfutils, with fixing commit identified
with

https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/elfutils.git/commit/?id=147018e729e7c22eeabf15b82d26e4bf68a0d18e

In https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1178888 though the same
commit is referenced, but the bug aliased to CVE-2014-9447.

Should one of those actually be rejected?

Regards,
Salvatore
