        CVE ID Change <cve-id-change@...re.org>
Subject: Question about tmp flaws in non-default build options (e.g. Kerberos
 DEBUG_ASN1)

So I found some obvious tmp vulns in Kerberos, but they only exist if
you build with DEBUG_ASN1 on (and if you're in that situation you got
some not fun problems).

However based on the fact that CVE-2014-1692 (the OpenSSH J-PAKE
protocol) it seems that even if the code is not enabled by default, the
fact that it exists is enough to qualify it for a CVE. So with this in
mind I'm sending a CVE request in.

First example from each of the 3 files affected by the DEBUG_ASN1 tmp
file issues (note: print_buffer_bin doesn't do anything clever to be safe):

===================================================
./src/plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_crypto_openssl.c
===================================================
#ifdef DEBUG_ASN1
    if (cms_msg_type == CMS_SIGN_CLIENT) {
        print_buffer_bin(*signed_data, *signed_data_len,
                         "/tmp/client_pkcs7_signeddata");
    } else {

===================================================
./src/plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_srv.c
===================================================
#ifdef DEBUG_ASN1
    print_buffer_bin(data->contents, data->length, "/tmp/kdc_as_req");
#endif
--

=================================
./src/plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_clnt.c
=================================
#ifdef DEBUG_ASN1
    print_buffer_bin((unsigned char *)coded_auth_pack->data,
                     coded_auth_pack->length,
                     "/tmp/client_auth_pack");
#endif
