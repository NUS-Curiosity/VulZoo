We are rejecting this CVE because there is, in effect, a specification
indicating that PHP would not be the responsible product for any
security issue related to a large number in the third argument to the
gregoriantojd or juliantojd function.

The http://php.net/manual/en/function.gregoriantojd.php and
http://php.net/manual/en/function.juliantojd.php pages state:

  year

     The year as a number between -4714 and 9999

  year

     The year as a number between -4713 and 9999

(Similar documentation has existed for several years, probably going
back to when gregoriantojd and juliantojd were first implemented.)

The integer overflow occurs for a year much larger than 9999
(approximately 1.47 million). This violates the specification, and it
is reasonable for PHP's behavior to be undefined. It's conceivable
that an open-source application exists with a security impact for
untrusted input of a year such as 1.47 million: in that case, a CVE ID
could be assigned to that application.

(In other words, a CVE can exist for an integer overflow that is
relevant only because of business logic. A CVE for an integer overflow
does not require the overflow to have any effect on memory safety.)
