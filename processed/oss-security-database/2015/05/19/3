Apparently a typo was made when fixing these issues in Ubuntu and
subsequently in Debian when ids with year 2015 were used instead of
2014.  Incorrect ids are used in patch names and changelogs, but e.g.
USN-2605-1 was released with correct ids.  I assume it's still prudent
to consider 2015 ids for rejection, it's likely they have not been
allocated yet.
