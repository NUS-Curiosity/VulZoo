Hash: SHA1

Hi,

Can someone explain how this can be a security issue,
and why scored as "high" risk ?


On bad input, the call will produce a bad output.

I don't see any way to exploit this for any bad thing.

I really think we should reject this CVE.
Upstream doesn't even consider this as a bug.


Remi.
