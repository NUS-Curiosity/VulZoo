Subject: Re: CVE request: XSS and CSRF in WP Smiley plugin for WordPress

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> Product: WordPress plugin wp-smiley
> Plugin page: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smiley/
> Vulnerable Versions: 1.4.1

Your message didn't mention the direct impact of an unauthorized
change to the s4w&#45;more field.

We think you mean something like:

  The vulnerabilities are independent because:

  - if only the CSRF were fixed, then an editor could
    intentionally conduct an XSS attack against an Administrator

  - if only the XSS were fixed, then an attacker could trigger use of
    their own text for a "More" button within the plugin, e.g.,
    by replacing the default word "More" with the attacker-supplied
    word "0wned" - and this would be visible to all site visitors

In that case:

Vulnerability Type:
  CWE-79: Cross-site scripting          CVE-2015-4139
  CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery   CVE-2015-4140
