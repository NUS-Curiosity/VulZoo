Wait, my first thought is that it's not obvious to me that
/proc/net/unix is guaranteed to be newline delimited, newline is a
perfectly valid name in a filename, no?

>>> import socket
>>> socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM).bind('test\ntest')
>>> sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
>>> sock.bind('/tmp/foo\nbar')
>>> sock.listen(1)

$ grep -A1 foo /proc/net/unix
0000000000000000: 00000002 00000000 00010000 0001 01 4772228 /tmp/foo
bar
