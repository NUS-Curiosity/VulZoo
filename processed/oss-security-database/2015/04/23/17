> This commit fixes three flaws:
> 
> https://github.com/audreyt/module-signature/commit/8a9164596fa5952d4fbcde5aa1c7d1c7bc85372f

> - Module::Signature could be tricked into interpreting the unsigned
> portion of a SIGNATURE file as the signed portion due to faulty parsing
> of the PGP signature boundaries.

Use CVE-2015-3406.


> - When verifying the contents of a CPAN module, Module::Signature
> ignored some files in the extracted tarball that were not listed in the
> signature file. This included some files in the t/ directory that would
> execute automatically during "make test"

Use CVE-2015-3407.


> - When generating checksums from the signed manifest, Module::Signature
> used two argument open() calls to read the files. This allowed embedding
> arbitrary shell commands into the SIGNATURE file that would execute
> during the signature verification process.

Use CVE-2015-3408.


> This commit fixes one more flaw:
> 
> https://github.com/audreyt/module-signature/commit/c41e8885b862b9fce2719449bc9336f0bea658ef
> 
> - Several modules were loaded at runtime inside the extracted module
> directory. Modules like Text::Diff are not guaranteed to be available on
> all platforms and could be added to a malicious module so that they
> would load from the '.' path in @INC.

Use CVE-2015-3409.
