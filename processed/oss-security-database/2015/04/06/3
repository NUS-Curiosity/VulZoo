irl@...e.org sent us a confirmation without a Cc to oss-security.

The CVE mapping is:

Use CVE-2015-2927. The known affected version of node (aka LinuxNode)
is 0.3.2 (for Debian, the "ax25-node" package name is associated with
the "node" source-package name). Within the URONode changelog, the
relevant entry is apparently "21/05/08 v1.0.5r3 ... I added a
quit_handler routine in the main loop which now will execute a
node_logout(), flush out the IPCs, log the event to syslog, and close
out the application properly."

This does not have a CVE ID. The node software was not attempting to
defend against a scenario in which a single client user causes
arbitrarily many node processes to run on the server simultaneously.
The node software runs as a service under inetd (or a similar
program), and any related restrictions would ordinarily be part of the
inetd configuration. Lack of restrictions is a site-specific problem.

("crafty malicious user" means, for example: if a client were allowed
to have 100 simultaneous node processes, the malicious user could
choose a request timing that ensured that 100 processes were always
running.)
