Subject: Re: CVE Request : IPv6 Hop limit lowering via RA messages

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> An unprivileged user on a local network can use IPv6 Neighbour
> Discovery ICMP to broadcast a non-route with a low hop limit, this
> causing machines to lower the hop limit on existing IPv6 routes.

> Projects impacted:  Linux kernel,  NetworkManager, FreeBSD Kernel

> https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=6fd99094de2b83d1d4c8457f2c83483b2828e75a

Use CVE-2015-2922 for the Linux kernel vulnerability.


> https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-net/2015-April/041934.html

Use CVE-2015-2923 for the FreeBSD vulnerability.


> ,  NetworkManager

This might refer to
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/tree/src/rdisc/nm-lndp-rdisc.c

  hop_limit = ndp_msgra_curhoplimit (msgra);
  if (rdisc->hop_limit != hop_limit) {
          rdisc->hop_limit = hop_limit;
          changed |= NM_RDISC_CONFIG_HOP_LIMIT;

however, the MITRE CVE team is not directly familiar with this part of
the NetworkManager code and has not researched any changes to the
"rdisc->hop_limit != hop_limit" test. There is apparently no commit
available yet at:

  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/log/src/rdisc/nm-lndp-rdisc.c

but, again, we don't know whether changes would need to occur there.

Use CVE-2015-2924 for the NetworkManager vulnerability.


Also, note that

  http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/453995/

refers to affected closed-source products. (CVE IDs for closed-source
products would be announced elsewhere.) It also refers to Android. We
don't know whether Android was listed only because of a
shared-codebase issue, e.g.,

  https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/android-3.18/net/ipv6/ndisc.c

(there is no commit at
https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+log/android-3.18/net/ipv6/ndisc.c
currently)

or whether Android is affected in other ways. Unless there is
incorrect hop_limit processing in code that is specific to Android,
Android would not have a unique CVE ID.
