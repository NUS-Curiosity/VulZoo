MITRE doesn't have any role in establishing the policies for use of
the oss-security list. The types of information you sent earlier --
references with vague changelog entries "Fixed for SQL injection
vulnerabilities" and "Fix SQL injection vulnerabilities" -- are
normally considered valid reports of open-source vulnerabilities,
e.g., a person who is neither the discoverer nor the vendor might
notice such a changelog entry and send it here. However, it is
somewhat unusual for a discoverer to choose a multi-stage approach in
which that level of a vague information is provided in one
oss-security post and full details are sent in a later post.

Our only suggestion for this case is that, given that the multi-stage
approach is already in progress, it would probably be best to
establish a link in at least one direction, e.g., either:

  - your full advisory should include a link to
    http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/04/14/5
    so that this previous discussion can be found

  or

  - you should make a later oss-security post in this thread, with a
    link to the public URL(s) for your full advisory, which might
    be in any of the four locations that you proposed
