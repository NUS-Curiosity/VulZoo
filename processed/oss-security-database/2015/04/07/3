Use CVE-2015-2931 for this issue involving an incomplete list of
disallowed MIME types for data: URIs (the application/xml type wasn't
in this list). In other words, CVE-2015-2931 does not refer more
generally to the desirability of the "MIME types are now whitelisted"
decision.

Use CVE-2015-2932 for this issue involving an incomplete list of
dangerous parts of HTML5. (The list is supposed to include all uses of
'animate attributename="xlink:href"' in SVG documents.)

Use CVE-2015-2933 for this XSS issue.

Also, this part of T73394 seems potentially interesting although it is
apparently neither a MediaWiki bug nor a PHP bug:

  https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T73394#750588
  preg_match() silently returns false on limit exhaustion

In other words, if a PHP application uses
"ini_set('pcre.recursion_limit'" and does not properly handle the
preg_match return value, then a hard-to-find XSS vulnerability might
exist.

Use CVE-2015-2934 for this interaction issue in which (roughly
speaking) secure operation of MediaWiki had been relying on a libxml
behavior that was removed for unrelated security reasons. (In other
words, it's apparently an usual type of vulnerability whose avoidance
requires studying all "improvements" in new releases of library code,
and determining whether any of them have unintended adverse
consequences.)

> https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85349

Use CVE-2015-2935 for this issue of information leaks observable in
log files on an attacker-controlled web server. This issue exists
because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-7199.


> * Internal review and iSEC Partners discovered (iSEC-WMF1214-1) that

> https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T64685

Use CVE-2015-2936 for this vulnerability with a CPU consumption impact.


> * Internal review found that MediaWiki is vulnerable to "Quadratic Blowup"
> DoS attacks, under both HHVM and Zend PHP.
> https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T71210

Use CVE-2015-2937. This is a quadratic issue and isn't the same as the
CVE-2015-2942 exponential issue affecting only HHVM (see below).


> * iSEC Partners reported that the MediaWiki feature allowing a user to
> preview another user's custom JavaScript could be abused for privilege
> escalation (iSEC-WMF1214-10). This feature has been removed.
> https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85855

Use CVE-2015-2938 for this XSS issue.


> * Extension:Scribunto - MediaWiki user Jackmcbarn discovered that function
> names were sanitized in Lua error backtraces, which could lead to XSS.
> https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85113

Use CVE-2015-2939 for this XSS issue. In the above quoted text, "were
sanitized" should be "were not sanitized" instead.

For purposes of CVE, we'll accept reports from a software's author
stating that there is a CSRF vulnerability for a request to read data.
Use CVE-2015-2940. This does not mean that similar reports from
arbitrary researchers about arbitrary products would have CVE IDs
assigned. For many products, the implied security policy does not
include a CSRF protection mechanism that prevents all
undesirable/confusing log entries.

There isn't a general rule that CVE IDs are assigned for arbitrary
unsupported deployments of a product. Our impression is that users may
realistically decide that the HHVM support is "complete enough" for
their purposes. Also, in some cases, HHVM support is referenced or
documented in places that don't directly discuss the experimental
nature, such as on the http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/HHVM and
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:How_to_debug pages. So, here, we
do want to assign CVE IDs applicable only to HHVM deployments.

It seems that the major concern here is the HHVM vulnerability fixed
by the
https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/commit/324701c9fd31beb4f070f1b7ef78b115fbdfec34
commit. Use CVE-2014-9714 for that HHVM vulnerability.

As far as we can tell, T85851 is recommending
https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/201020/1/includes/api/ApiFormatWddx.php,unified
as a vulnerability fix for MediaWiki deployments that use an older
version of HHVM. Use CVE-2015-2941 for this MediaWiki vulnerability in
which unsafe calls to wddx_serialize_value can occur.

> https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T85848

Use CVE-2015-2942 for this exponential issue, which is different from
the CVE-2015-2937 quadratic issue mentioned above.
