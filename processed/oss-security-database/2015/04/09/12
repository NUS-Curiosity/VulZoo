It might be worthwhile to answer this in two ways.

First, the scope of the CVE-2013-7439 assignment does cover
application code that was built with this macro, in the sense that
applications cannot have their own unique CVE IDs for the same
problem. In other words, if building with this macro is what is
calling an application's security into question, then there wouldn't
be a separate CVE ID for that application.

Second, if an application's vendor wants to publish a security
advisory mapping to CVE-2013-7439, then it is preferable for the
vendor to verify that the existence of the macro actually has a
security impact for that application. However, there is no reasonable
way for the MITRE CVE team to require that. An application's vendor
might not have the resources or expertise. For example, the
application's vendor optionally could decide to map to CVE-2013-7439
based only on noticing that the macro is used.

In any case, the information posted by others in this thread would be
very useful for risk-assessment questions that go beyond "how can this
CVE ID be used."
