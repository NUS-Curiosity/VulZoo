Use CVE-2015-3299 for the specific issue in your "Description" section
above. It seems conceivable that 1129648 also fixed something else,
e.g.,

  1. Maybe the
     "-     add_action( 'wp_ajax_nopriv_fsb_save_order', array( $this, 'save_order' ) );"

     code change means that wp_ajax_nopriv_fsb_save_order allowed
     bypassing intended access control, even if the attacker did not
     supply an XSS payload.

  2. Maybe the patched code can help to prevent a CSRF attack against
     an authenticated action handler.

If so, then additional CVE IDs would be needed.
