Nope, it is not a vulnerability specific to OpenSSL, but a design
weakness in the SSLv3 protocol - so all implementations of SSLv3 are
affected. I would use the same CVE-2014-3566 for all software that still
uses SSLv3.
This is different to "POODLE TLS", where some implementations (but not
OpenSSL) contained a similar vulnerability in their implementation of
the TLS 1.0 protocol (although the TLS 1.0 standard itself does not have
it). In this case different CVE IDs are suggested - see Mitre's
statement at [1]
"POODLE TLS" is references in multiple CVEs, see [2]

No - see above...
