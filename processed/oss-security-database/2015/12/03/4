Affects
~~~~~~~
- - Ironic: >= 4.2.0, <= 4.2.1


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Brad Morgan from Rackspace reported a vulnerability in Ironic. To
prevent user data leak, Ironic is expected to "clean" a server after
use, however that is transparently not happening. Previous tenant's data
may be left behind on the disk and may be available to new users. All
Ironic setups are affected.
