Subject: CVE Request: Cups Filters/Foomatic Filters: Does not consider
 semicolon as an illegal shell escape character

Hi

CVE-2015-8327 was assigned to cups-filters/foomatic-rip since it does
not consider the back ticks as an illegal shell escape character
and allowing code execution.

There was another commit in cups-filters upstream (revision 7419) as
well adding (;) to the set of illegal shell escape characters:

http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7419

an was found by Adam Chester.

Could you assign a CVE for this issue as well?

Regards,
Salvatore
