Subject: Re: CVE Request: Linux kernel: privilege escalation in user namespaces

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Use CVE-2015-8709 for the issue fixed in the
https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/12/25/71 post.

(This is not yet available at
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/kernel/ptrace.c
and http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=145118185526359 might be the
current end of the earlier discussion.)

This issue has been covered in security advisories from one or more
Linux distributions, e.g.,

>> http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2847-1
>> 
>> Jann Horn discovered a ptrace issue with user namespaces in the Linux
>> kernel. The namespace owner could potentially exploit this flaw by ptracing
>> a root owned process entering the user namespace to elevate its privileges

There has been some discussion of whether the finding was a
vulnerability discovery, e.g.,

>>> From: Jann Horn <jann@...jh.net>
>>>

We feel that, more generally, the usn-2847-1 mention of "and
potentially gain access outside of the namespace" is a realistic
concern.
