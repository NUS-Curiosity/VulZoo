This 2015-09-06 message is directly related to a discussion of CVE
assignment here on 2015-06-22, but doesn't mention that that
discussion had occurred. Specifically:

  From: cve-assign@...re.org

  devise-two-factor can potentially have a CVE ID. As you mentioned, the
  attack surface is somewhat narrow, and it might make more sense to see
  how the devise-two-factor vendor announces the update. For example, if
  the vendor makes a code change to prevent multiple submissions and
  describes the code change as resolving a vulnerability, then there can
  be a CVE ID.

The vendor did all of that, so we're assigning CVE-2015-7225.

[ relevant parts include 'to protect against "shoulder-surfing" attacks' in
https://github.com/tinfoil/devise-two-factor/blob/master/UPGRADING.md and
'While a valid security issue, this is a very narrow vulnerability' in
https://github.com/tinfoil/devise-two-factor/issues/45#issuecomment-139335608 ]
