For context, Oracle has assigned CVE-2015-0478 for the missing hardening
in the default JCE implementation:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1210355
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuapr2015-2365600.html#AppendixJAVA
https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-0478

This case is similar to libgcrypt, I believe: no key leaks have been
attributed to this implementation, the change is purely hardening in
this sense (and I would not have assigned a CVE ID to this).
