===============================================
OSSA-2015-019: Glance image status manipulation
===============================================

:Date: September 22, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2015-5251


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Glance: <=2014.2.3, >=2015.1.0, <=2015.1.1


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Hemanth Makkapati of Rackspace reported a vulnerability in Glance. By
submitting a HTTP PUT request with a "x-image-meta-status" header, a
tenant can manipulate the status of their images. A malicious tenant
may exploit this flaw to reactivate disabled images, bypass storage
quotas and in some cases replace image contents. Setups using the
Glance v1 API allow the illegal modification of image status. Setups
which also use the v2 API may allow a subsequent re-upload of image
contents.
