As per the Wikipedia entry:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures#Description

This is a standardized text description of the issue(s). One common entry
is:

** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization
or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem.
When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this
candidate will be provided.

This means that the entry number has been reserved by Mitre for an issue or
a CNA has reserved the number. So in the case where a CNA requests a block
of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in blocks
of 500), the CVE number will be marked as reserved even though the CVE
itself may not be assigned by the CNA for some time. Until the CVE is
assigned AND Mitre is made aware of it (e.g. the embargo passes and the
issue is made public), AND Mitre has researched the issue and written a
description of it, entries will show up as "** RESERVED **".
