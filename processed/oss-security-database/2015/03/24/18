There is no hard information in those bug reports.  It's not clear
what, precisely, they are about, and so it is impossible to tell if
they actually have been fixed.  I appreciate that you clean out old
stuff, but doing it this way makes it seem you suddenly have developed
a policy for secrecy around security issues.

(CVE-2014-0048)

Could this be a dupe of the index.docker.io registry misconfiguration
that had at least one redirect to http:// (now fixed) for the actual
(unverified) image data?
