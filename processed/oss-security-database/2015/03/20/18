Our understanding of the discussion is, very roughly:

  - given the design goals of this part of the Linux kernel, it is
    reasonable for someone (who has a realistic use case for the Linux
    kernel code) to assert that this stack overflow crosses privilege
    boundaries within their environment

  - there are probably many other environments in which a person may
    guess that this stack overflow crosses privilege boundaries, but
    it actually doesn't

We think that's enough to have a CVE. Use CVE-2015-2666.
