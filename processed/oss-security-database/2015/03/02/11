We did not completely understand this part of the vendor interaction:

https://github.com/ZeusCart/zeuscart/issues/28#issuecomment-72829334
https://github.com/ZeusCart/zeuscart/commit/fa919a5e4887a7d348166eac4f10b041684208ca

https://github.com/ZeusCart/zeuscart/issues/28#issuecomment-73352761

The vendor seems to be suggesting the CVE-2014-3868 patch, which had
been previously discussed in the
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/116 post. This patch seems
related to:

  prodid
  qty
  variations
  subId

whereas your report is about:

  id
  cid

(An entirely separate issue is that the patch has a "$_POST['qty'] =
abs((int)$_GET['prodid']);" line that might result in unintended
quantity values.)

So, we think that there is not, in any sense, a "version" of ZeusCart
that fixes any attack vector that you reported. If there were an
incomplete fix, additional CVE IDs may be required.

Use CVE-2015-2183 for all of the SQL injection issues in your report.

Use CVE-2015-2184.
