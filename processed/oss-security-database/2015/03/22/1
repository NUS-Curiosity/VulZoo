-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Use CVE-2015-2672 for the vulnerability fixed by the
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=06c8173eb92bbfc03a0fe8bb64315857d0badd06
commit.

The rest of this message can probably be skipped unless someone cares
about the details of why
http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/03/20/17 was sent.

We had previously proposed
"https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit?id=f31a9f7c71691569359fa7fb8b0acaa44bce0324 ...
had security-relevant value even though it was later determined to be
mis-protecting." This was based on your earlier phrase of "ends up
protecting the .altinstr_replacement from faulting." We now understand
that "ends up protecting the .altinstr_replacement from faulting"
actually does not ever protect anything. If the "pointer to the
instruction which might fault" points to .altinstr_replacement, this
is completely useless for preventing denial-of-service attacks. More
generally, having the "pointer to the instruction which might fault"
point to .altinstr_replacement results in absolutely zero
security-relevant value. Thus, there isn't a second CVE ID.

This was just a question of commonly used, but imprecise, terminology.
In typical usage on the oss-security list, stating that a CVE ID is
for a commit means that the CVE ID is associated with the
vulnerability that the commit fixed. This imprecise terminology can
work poorly in situations where a commit fixed one security problem
but introduced a different security problem, or situations in which
there is a possible misinterpretation that that had happened.
