Your analysis is similar to mine, and private correspondence with the developer.

I've added a comment to PHP docs for getimagesize to remind folks it doesn't validate images, I don't think this is a bug.

It might be a useful feature for PHP to have a simple file upload validation (Image magick has one), but there is no guarantee that valid files won't be misinterpreted as malicious if you can get them interpreted in an inappropriate context.
