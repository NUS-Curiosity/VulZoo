I find this really hard to believe based on the past. So you're saying
Oracle is willing to work with Red Hat and the community in general now?
Can we get access to the MySQL security bugs and test cases for example?
This would be HUGELY helpful to the community.

I'll believe Oracle is willing to work with the community when I
actually see Oracle participate and help the community. Until then it's
just words from some random Oracle employee and most likely isn't
official policy.

So prove to us you want to work with us (e.g. by opening up the MySQL
security bugs/test cases) and we can definitely look at future cooperation.
