This is off topic but anyways, I don't care if people repackage RHEL and
give it away/sell it, that's something the business model we have
explicitly takes into account, and indeed something we actively support
with groups that participate meaningfully in the open source community
(e.g. with the CentOS and Scientific Linux community).

If customers want features in RHEL asking on oss-security is not the way
to go about it, ask your TAM/GSS.

If vendors want features in their rebranded RHEL they can add them. I
have no clue why you would need broad agreement from the community
including Red Hat to add a feature to Oracle Linux.

If you lack the engineering talent to add this feature, then at least
with RHEL you can become a customer and get support (new features if
requested by enough customers obviously become more of a priority but I
can't make any promises obviously). Which leads back to the "ask your
TAM/GSS" point.
