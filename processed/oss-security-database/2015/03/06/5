Until today it seems:
 https://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN64455813/index.html

Patch is
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.1/changesets/b9619.patch> if
you want to try back-porting. Take care though if you do, all the
earlier versions have different logics surrounding how the connection
data gets accounted.

I hope this one is better for you. Still outstanding on Mitre's
verdict about the CVE number though. JPCERT tell me that should be
next week, but you probably know more than me how reliable an estimate
that is.
