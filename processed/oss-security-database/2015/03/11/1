Hi Kurt,

Your corporate pissing match with Oracle is not helpful.

I proposed this in the context of me giving up reporting these sorts of bugs
to RedHat (go search my BZ account), and frankly since you don't have
the resources to perform simple tests against your main products (RHEV,
Satellite, RHN), then a blanket solution seems reasonable.

It's not a problem because nobody's looking.  Holy crap, just look at
Satellite 6 and tell me you think that product doesn't need more than an
audit.
