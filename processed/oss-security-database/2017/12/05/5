OSSA-2017-006: Nova FilterScheduler doubles resource allocations during rebuild with new image
==============================================================================================

:Date: December 05, 2017
:CVE: CVE-2017-17051


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Nova: ==16.0.3


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Matt Riedemann from Huawei reported a vulnerability in OpenStack
Nova's default FilterScheduler. By repeatedly rebuilding an instance
with new images, an authenticated user may consume untracked resources
on a hypervisor host leading to a denial of service. This regression
was introduced with the fix for OSSA-2017-005 (CVE-2017-16239),
however, only Nova stable/pike or later deployments with that fix
applied and relying on the default FilterScheduler are affected.
