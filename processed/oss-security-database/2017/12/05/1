Subject: CVE-2017-8824 linux: use-after-free in DCCP code

Hi,


This is an announcement for CVE-2017-8824 which is a use-after-free
vulnerability

I found in Linux DCCP socket. It can be used to gain kernel code execution
from unprivileged processes.



Youâ€™ll find in attachment the proof of concept code and the kernel panic
log.



#######   BUG DETAILS  ############



When a socket sock object is in DCCP_LISTEN  state and connect() system
call is being called with AF_UNSPEC,

the dccp_disconnect() puts sock state into DCCP_CLOSED, and forgets to free
dccps_hc_rx_ccid/dccps_hc_tx_ccid and assigns NULL to them,

then when we call connect() again with AF_INET6 sockaddr family, the sock
object gets cloned via dccp_create_openreq_child() and returns a new sock
object,

which holds references of dccps_hc_rx_ccid and dccps_hc_tx_ccid of the old
sock object, and this leads to both the old and new sock objects can use
the same memory.
