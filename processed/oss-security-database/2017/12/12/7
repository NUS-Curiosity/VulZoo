Another one.

This one looks more interesting. It's a serious memory corruption, and
since it's in the USB core subsystem, it can't be mitigated by turning
off particular USB drivers.

A malicious USB device can potentially exploit this by controlling the
next heap object after the one where usb_host_config is allocated and
gaining an arbitrary decrement primitive, since kref_put() will be
called with an attacker controlled address.

### CVE

* http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-17558

The usb_destroy_configuration function in drivers/usb/core/config.c in
the USB core subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.14.5 does not
consider the maximum number of configurations and interfaces before
attempting to release resources, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service (out-of-bounds access) or possibly have unspecified
other impact.
