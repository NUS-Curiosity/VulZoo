Subject: CVE-2017-17741 kernel: kvm: stack-based out-of-bounds read via vmcall
 instruction

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the KVM virtualization(CONFIG_KVM) support is 
vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read access issue. It could occur when 
emulating vmcall instruction invoked by a guest.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to disclose kernel memory bytes.
