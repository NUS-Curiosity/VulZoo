There is no co-ordination between the two projects and they have been 
independent for 15 years already.  This in spite of one developer 
being a member of both projects, and some contributions to 
GraphicsMagick from heavy ImageMagick contributors.

Regardless, it is difficult for someone such as myself to know the 
possible significance of each of the many issues which are fixed other 
than obvious issues such as shell exploits and DOS.

There is old code which was common at the time of the fork but many 
issues pertain to newer code which is not common.
