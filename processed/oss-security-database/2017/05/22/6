 uninitialized memory in RLE decoder

Hi,

let me take the opportunity to jump into this.

Bob, do you have any PoC you can share with ImageMagick project
regarding CVE-2017-6335?

Your fix was
https://sourceforge.net/p/graphicsmagick/code/ci/6156b4c2992d855ece6079653b3b93c3229fc4b8/

I asked ImageMagick project about that issue but they don't know without
a PoC, see https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/391

Thanks!
