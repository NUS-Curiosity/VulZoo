I've worked with the GM team before - it's trivial as a researcher to
keep Bob up to date on what you're coming across in IM.
This problem doesn't stop at IM/GM - there are probably bugs you find
in IM/GM that also trip up other software, and little effort is made
to see the impact in other image software. We could probably benefit
from a curated centralized corpus for this kind of thing.
