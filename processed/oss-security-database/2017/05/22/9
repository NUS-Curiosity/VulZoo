Ah, I recently did a large number of CVE assignments, I haven't emailed out
to the sequesters yet, yours was
https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-2017-1000000/blob/f2e15ac3468dd382d9ffa3d5acc032c106f3248c/CVE-2017-1000025.json
I believe.

Part of the challenge of the DWF is this is more of an experiment to figure
out what we need/how to do it, mostly so I can scale it out/up to the
entire Open Source world. So CVEs are a bit slow right now, but that should
get better over the next few months.
