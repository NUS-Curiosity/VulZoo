Subject: CVE-2017-9310 Qemu: net: infinite loop in e1000e NIC emulation

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the e1000e NIC emulation support is vulnerable to an 
infinite loop issue. It could occur while processing data via transmit or 
receive descriptors, provided the initial receive/transmit descriptor 
head(TDH/RDH) is set outside the allocated descriptor buffer.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=4154c7e03fa55b4cf52509a83d50d6c09d743b7

Reference:

   -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1452620

This issue was reported by Li Qiang of Qihoo 360 Gear Team.


Thank you.
