Subject: CVE-2016-5394 : Apache Sling XSS vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Sling XSS Protection API 1.0.8

Description:
The encoding done by the XSSAPI.encodeForJSString() method is not
restrictive enough and for some input patterns allows script tags to
pass through unencoded, leading to potential XSS vulnerabilities.

Mitigation:
Users should upgrade to version 1.0.12 or later of the XSS Protection
API module.
