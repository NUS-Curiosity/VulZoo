Subject: Devil's Ivy (CVE-2017-9765) in gSOAP 2.7 up to 2.8.47

I noticed some press coverage of this but haven't seen mail here yet:

http://blog.senr.io/blog/devils-ivy-flaw-in-widely-used-third-party-code-impacts-millions
https://www.genivia.com/advisory.html#Security_advisory:_CVE-2017-9765_bug_in_certain_versions_of_gSOAP_2.7_up_to_2.8.47_(June_21,_2017)
https://www.genivia.com/changelog.html#Version_2.8.48_upd_(06/21/2017)

"a potential vulnerability to a large and specific XML message over 2GB in size
  (greater than 2147483711 bytes to trigger the software bug). A buffer overflow
  can cause an open unsecured server to crash or malfunction after 2GB is
  received."

Unfortunately, the subversion repo on sourceforge for gSOAP only has
full releases, not individual changes, in each commit, so the fix
appears to be somewhere mixed in [r119] on
https://sourceforge.net/p/gsoap2/code/commit_browser
making it a challenge for distros who want to patch instead of upgrade.
