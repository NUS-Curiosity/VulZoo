Subject: CVE-2017-2620 Qemu: display: cirrus: out-of-bounds access issue
 while in cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo

   Hello,

Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support is 
vulnerable to an out-of-bounds access issue. It could occur while copying VGA 
data in cirrus_bitblt_cputovideo.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
resulting in DoS OR potentially execute arbitrary code on the host with 
privileges of Qemu process on the host.
