Yes, but we're in the process of creating a JSON data format and finalizing
it (already on v.4, rapid iteration for the win), once that is done
(hopefully another month or so to nail it down) the DWF will start to
publish data in that format so MITRE can consume it and as time goes on the
DWF will ramp up (there's a lot to do if you want to build a system that
will assign a few hundred thousand CVEs efficiently =). We'll be making
some announcements at RSA in 2 weeks.
