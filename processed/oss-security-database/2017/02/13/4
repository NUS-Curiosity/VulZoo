Hi Doran,

we do not see this issue being technically the same thing as
CVE-2016-9318. openpyxl shouldn't need to resolve *external* XML
entities, and the initial reporter of the Debian bug tested that the
upstream patch doesn't break reglar entities like "&lt"; and
"&gt;". What do you think ?

Cheers,
