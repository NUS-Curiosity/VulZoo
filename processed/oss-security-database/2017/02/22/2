 vulnerability

CVE-2016-7078: Foreman user with no organizations or locations can see
all resources

A user account that is associated to no organizations or locations is
able to view resources from all organizations/locations in the web UI or
API, when either the organization or location feature is enabled. The
user remains subject to permissions and filters on their assigned roles.

Mitigation: ensure all users are assigned to at least one organization
or location, or disable the feature if unused.

This issue was reported by Daniel Lobato Garcia.

Affects all known Foreman versions
Fix due to be released in Foreman 1.15.0
