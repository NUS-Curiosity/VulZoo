Thanks for the report. I just tried to reproduce the issue on Ubuntu
16.04 with 2.0.7-0ubuntu1~16.04.2, which is the package patched for the
issue that I announced in this thread. I couldn't reproduce it.

I then installed an old 2.0.6 based deb (2.0.6-0ubuntu1~ubuntu16.04.1)
and still couldn't reproduce it.

I'd suggest opening an upstream bug here:

  https://github.com/lxc/lxc/issues/new

(Normally, they prefer private security bugs on Launchpad but your
report to this list is already public so I don't see a need.)
