Subject: libpcre: invalid memory read in match (pcre_exec.c)

Description:
libpcre is a perl-compatible regular expression library.

A fuzz on libpcre1 through the pcretest utility revealed an invalid read in the library. For who is interested in a detailed description of the bug, will follow a feedback from upstream:

This was a genuine bug in the 32-bit library. Thanks for finding it. The crash was caused by trying to find a Unicode property for a code value greater than 0x10ffff, the Unicode maximum, when running 
in non-UTF mode (where character values can be up to 0xffffffff). The bug was in both PCRE1 and PCRE2. I have fixed both of them.

The complete ASan output:

# pcretest -32 -d $FILE
