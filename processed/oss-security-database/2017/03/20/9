Subject: CVE-2017-5644 - Possible DOS (Denial of Service) in Apache POI
 versions prior to 3.15

Hi,

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions affected: all versions prior to version 3.15
Apache POI in versions prior to release 3.15 allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
via a specially crafted OOXML file, aka an XML Entity Expansion (XEE)
attack.

Users with applications which accept content from external or untrusted
sources are advised to upgrade to
Apache POI 3.15 or newer.

Thanks to Xiaolong Zhu and Huijun Chen from Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.
for reporting the vulnerability.
