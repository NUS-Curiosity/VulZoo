Subject: CVE-2017-6414 Qemu: libcacard: host memory leakage while creating
 new APDU

   Hello,

The CAC(Common Access Card) library, used by Quick Emulator(Qemu) to implement 
smartcard support, is vulnerable to a host memory leakage issue. It could 
occur while allocating a new APDU object using guest supplied raw byte stream 
in 'vcard_apdu_new'.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory resulting in DoS.
