Subject: CVE-2017-9334 CHICKEN Scheme: denial of service due to invalid
 pointer dereference

Hi all,

I just received my assignment of CVE-2017-9334 for this issue:

An incorrect "pair?" check in the Scheme "length" procedure results in                                                                  
an unsafe pointer dereference in all CHICKEN Scheme versions prior to                                                                   
4.13, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by passing                                                                  
an improper list to an application that calls "length" on it.
