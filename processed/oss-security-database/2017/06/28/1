Subject: [CVE-2017-7686] Apache Ignite Information Disclosure

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* Apache Ignite 1.0.0-RC3 to 2.0

Impact:

Apache Ignite Might Transfer Sensitive Information to 3rd Party Domain

Description:

Apache Ignite uses an update notifier component to update the users about new project releases that include additional functionality, bug fixes and performance improvements. To do that the component communicates to an external PHP server (http://ignite.run) where it needs to send some system properties like Apache Ignite or Java version. Some of the properties might contain user sensitive information.

Mitigation:

* The domain (http://ignite.run) was moved to ASF and the server was brought down. No data transfer longer happens by default. No extra actions are needed on the end user side.

Credit:

The vulnerability was discovered by: 

* Makoto Yui of Treasure Data, Inc.
