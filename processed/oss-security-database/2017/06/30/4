Subject: Re: ISC announces two BIND vulnerabilities

For transparency and for information of those wanting to join the
distros list (thus, for them to have a better idea of whether
membership would be useful to them or not): ISC brought these issues to
the distros list on June 28 (or the night of June 29 UTC), so distros
list members had about 1.5 days of advance notice.

Thank you, Yves-Alexis!

Adding to this, attached are text exports of the ISC advisories,
produced by running ELinks against "Print Article" versions of the ISC
web pages.

It would be great if ISC would resume posting the actual detail in here
themselves, in addition to the website links.

Thanks again,
