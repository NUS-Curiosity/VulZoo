Subject: CVE-2017-9524 Qemu: nbd: segmentation fault due to client

    Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the Network Block Device(NBD) Server support 
is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue. It could occur while 
releasing a client, which was not initialised due to failed negotiation.

A remote user/process could use this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server 
resulting in DoS.
