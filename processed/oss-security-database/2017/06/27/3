Since your professional job is to issue CVEs and you did so in our case based
on an erroneous judgement call, I believe it falls into this category.

You have yet to explain why it is so. The Qualys advisory and their explicit
reject requests state the exact opposite.

I will stop emailing you when you live up to your professional obligation
and make sure that the CVE you issued in error is rescinded.

You said that the requestor has to ask for the rejection. Since you are the
requestor, only you can do so though you tried to drag Qualys into this.
They still made the reject request a week ago but you haven't acted on it
yet despite your promise to do so. Now you're telling us that we have yet
something else to do? Please elaborate as your past communications didn't
explain any further.

What security property did we claim for the kernel enforced heap-stack
gap size? Can you recite anything we said anywhere about that supports
your claim?
