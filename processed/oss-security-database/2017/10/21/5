 in glob with GLOB_TILDE

Just a heads up for anyone around over the weekend ...

== CVE-2017-15670 ==
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15670
"The GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.27 contains an 
off-by-one error leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in the glob 
function in glob.c, related to the processing of home directories using 
the ~ operator followed by a long string."

privileges or execute code."

== CVE-2017-15671 ==
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-15671
"The glob function in glob.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 
before 2.27, when invoked with GLOB_TILDE, could skip freeing allocated 
memory when processing the ~ operator with a long user name, potentially 
leading to a denial of service (memory leak)."
