Subject: binutils: NULL pointer dereference in bfd_hash_hash (hash.c)

Description:
binutils is a set of tools necessary to build programs.

The stacktrace of this issue appears to be a NULL pointer access. However the upstream maintainer changed the summary of the bugreport to “DW_AT_name with out of bounds reference”. The commit also 
reference to “DW_AT_name with out of bounds reference”

The complete ASan output of the issue:
