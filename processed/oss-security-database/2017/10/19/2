Subject: Re: Stored XSS vulnerability in ILIAS <= 5.2.8 and <= 5.1.20

I just skimmed through the fix, I am trying to understand how does this
function if (is_int(strpos(strtolower($a_val), "javascript"))) sanitize the
input as below payloads


1. %22%7D%5D%7D%29%3Balert%280%29%3B     --------> "}]});alert(0);
2. %27%27%3B%21--%22%3CXSS%3E%3D%26%7B%28%29%7D  ---> '';!--"<XSS>=&{()}
