Subject: CVE-2017-12190: Linux kernel: block: memory leak when merging small
 consecutive buffers in SCSI IO vectors

Heololo,

Vitaly Mayatskikh has found that bio_map_user_iov() and bio_unmap_user() in
'block/bio.c' do unbalanced pages refcounting if IO vector has small consecutive
buffers belonging to the same page. bio_add_pc_page() merges them into one, but
the page reference is never dropped, causing memory leak.

Regarding security affect, the flaw is somewhat useless for an attacker on
a local system as it requires SCSI disk to be present, root privileges or RAWIO
caps, but this can be quickly turned into a meaningful attack if a SCSI disk is
passed through to a virtual machine. An attacker can issue absolutely legit SCSI
read/write commands to a disk in his VM, that will make VM's memory pages used
for IO to be extra refcounted. Then attacker can power down a VM and the memory
will be definitely lost. Few exploit runs with power cycles in between, and
the whole host can get OOM.
