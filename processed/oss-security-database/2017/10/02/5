Subject: dnsmasq: CVE-2017-14491 to CVE-2017-14496 and CVE-2017-13704

A set of serious security vulnerabilities for dnsmasq have been released
today.

These include remote DoS and possibly code execution, and at least some
apply to essentially every non-ancient dnsmasq release.

Most of these were found by Google and their writeup is here.

The fixes are contained in the dnsmasq 2-78 release, announced here:

and are in the dnsmasq git repo, here:
