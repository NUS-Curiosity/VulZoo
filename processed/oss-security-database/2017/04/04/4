Subject: [CVE-2017-5649] Apache Geode information disclosure vulnerability

CVE-2017-5649: Apache Geode information disclosure vulnerability

Severity:  Medium
Base score:  5.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Geode 1.1.0

Description:
When a cluster has enabled security by setting the security-manager
property, a user should have DATA:READ permission to view data stored
in the cluster.  However, if an authenticated user has CLUSTER:READ
but not DATA:READ permission they can access the data
browser page in Pulse.  From there the user could execute an OQL query
that exposes data stored in the cluster.

Mitigation:
1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.1
