Subject: libsamplerate: global buffer overflow in calc_output_single (src_sinc.c)

Description:
libsamplerate is a Sample Rate Converter for audio.

This bug was initially discovered and silently fixed by the upstream author Erik de Castro Lopo (erikd). As usual Iâ€™m providing the stacktrace and the reproducer so that all release distros can test and 
patch their own version of the package.
