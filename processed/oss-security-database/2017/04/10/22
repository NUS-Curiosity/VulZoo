Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2017-5650 Apache Tomcat Denial of Service

CVE-2017-5650 Apache Tomcat Denial of Service

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18
Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.12
Apache Tomcat 8.0.x and earlier are not affected

Description
The handling of an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close
streams associated with that connection that were currently waiting for
a WINDOW_UPDATE before allowing the application to write more data.
These waiting streams each consumed a thread. A malicious client could
therefore construct a series of HTTP/2 requests that would consume all
available processing threads.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following
mitigations:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M19 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.13 or later

Credit:
This issue was identified by Chun Han Hsiao and reported responsibly to
the Tomcat security team.
