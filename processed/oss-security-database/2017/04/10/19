Subject: web2py: CVE-2016-10321: does not check if a host is denied before
 verifying passwords

Hi

CVE-2016-10321 was assigned (via cveform.mitre.org) to the following
issue in web2py:

web2py before 2.14.6 does not properly check if a host is denied
before verifying passwords, allowing a remote attacker to perform
brute-force attacks.

Fixing commit:

Regards,
Salvatore
