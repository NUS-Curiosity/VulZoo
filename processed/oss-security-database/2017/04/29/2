I don't think so, that is CVE-2016-7976 and is entirely unrelated to
the issue being discussed, other than superficial similarity of the
exploit.

That issue was reported by me, and we discussed the ImageMagick and
evince attack vectors at the time, you can check the archives if
you're interested.

This issue (CVE-2017-8291) is a type confusion vulnerability (well,
technically two vulnerabilities), and was found in the wild.
