Subject: CVE-2017-7471 Qemu: 9p: virtfs allows guest to change filesystem
 attributes on host

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 
File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper access control issue. 
It could occur while accessing files on a shared host directory.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to access host file system 
beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their privileges on a 
host.
