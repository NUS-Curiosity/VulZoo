Subject: New security advisories for Apache CXF

The Apache CXF project has released two new security advisories:

a) CVE-2017-5653: Apache CXF JAX-RS XML Security streaming clients do not
validate that the service response was signed or encrypted.

b) CVE-2017-5656: Apache CXF's STSClient uses a flawed way of caching
tokens that are associated with delegation tokens.

More details, including the text of the security advisories, are available
at:

http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.html
