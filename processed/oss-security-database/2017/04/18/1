Subject: [CVE-2017-5662] Apache Batik information disclosure vulnerability

CVE-2017-5662:

        Apache Batik information disclosure vulnerability

 

Severity:

        Medium

 

Vendor:

        The Apache Software Foundation

 

Versions Affected:

        Batik 1.0 - 1.8

 

Description:

        Files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses batik can

        be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG

        files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context

        in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root

        a full compromise of the server--including confidential or sensitive

        files--would be possible.

 

        XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server

        via denial of service as the references within a xml document

        can trivially trigger an amplification attack.

 

Mitigation:

        Users should upgrade to Batik 1.9+
