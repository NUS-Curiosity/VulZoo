 Hi,


 CVE-2017-8291 was reported initially to Ghostscript by the Atlassian Security Team. We worked with the developers of Ghostscript to address this vulnerability. This vulnerability impacts versions 9.21 and earlier, and is called from many other libraries, such as Pillow and ImageMagick. Fortunately, fixes have now been pushed to master and can be reviewed here: https://u4790715.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=UqF7hxEfY-2BoQE5y7ee5wrpEERVsJr450MPBUJBBKike04wjKjU6jNBRqCvnzFkirKb6U3wFxO6cZ2MrfZFe9KXxeenPQ9IFz8TJhw6LOtOaFuB-2BSAw9BeCw0BhtT081tIKPb6Ah9qpSmP-2FzO2sx-2BjA-3D-3D_XV8vHdrbCxPyFLm6RhvyOinpL-2BlJJ4T-2BnPsLAd4H4ga1C-2B6KK34tjEg4ad7hndokvEujZN9oFs-2BPmwZc69UJbIeCjEPp1RqnDE5ZMVkV8u-2FQck2RKXjMbDOcixr2-2BNtOmj3Wzq5XwkhDFXhU2AKyL9layYKe-2BQtxt0vvnrLW-2BhggU2jp-2FuYmlu1mgnKq3GLT-2BQs66xRLMVK0ptzU4dayw9UBPVRQ2Fkfj-2FJw1BXrk-2BY-3D and https://u4790715.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=UqF7hxEfY-2BoQE5y7ee5wrpEERVsJr450MPBUJBBKike04wjKjU6jNBRqCvnzFkirJzYNkGRnjRAeENnIy4IlGMktl4IMwqOL-2F6c9eA2tuyk4XtZY7kQE2gU21K2S6Iame7IH19-2BL1vfBFf0SU6yEiA-3D-3D_XV8vHdrbCxPyFLm6RhvyOinpL-2BlJJ4T-2BnPsLAd4H4ga1C-2B6KK34tjEg4ad7hndokvEujZN9oFs-2BPmwZc69UJbPyFjltEjXNsT3qz-2Fb9AtZOlxcf7srfg3ApNJwAPl06rQsoKGLAu393JsVQP6IMnwpmfkPtqhUc0Kd-2Fr-2BdA39SFaSuqgV1MSaFq7Bx7Osg3G1ng9ujPr9Xt71FOQOsCM9Ada5YhYxQbHq72hBUfE7-2Bo-3D
