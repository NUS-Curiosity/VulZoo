This (libxml2 XXE) has already been assigned CVE-2016-9318.

I have proposed a(n incomplete) patch on that ticket, but do not have
sufficient familiarity with libxml2 to be sure it is sound (and thus
worth completing with proper tests and docs).  If it is, it's possible
that downstream projects could apply a similar patch in client code
while remaining compatible with current (unpatched) libxml2.

Even if this gets into libxml2, client code will need to enable a new
option explicitly to prevent XXE.  There's an argument to make NOXXE
default behaviour, but this could potentially impact a lot of projects
that silently rely on some form of external entity resolution.

xmlsec is exposed to CVE-2016-9318, but considers this a bug in libxml2
and at present has no plans to provide a workaround.  I expect a CVE
assignment for xmlsec will only be needed if it is fixed/worked around
in that project.
