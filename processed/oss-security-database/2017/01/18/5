Subject: CVE-2017-2591 389 Directory Server: DoS via OOB heap read in
 "attribute uniqueness" plugin

Hi,

This is to disclose the following CVE:

CVE-2017-2591 389 Directory Server: DoS via OOB heap read

Description :

The "attribute uniqueness" plugin did not properly NULL-terminate an array
when building up its configuration, if a so called 'old-style'
configuration, was being used (Using nsslapd-pluginarg<X> parameters) .

A attacker, authenticated, but possibly also unauthenticated, could
possibly force the plugin to read beyond allocated memory and trigger a
segfault.

The crash could also possibly be triggered accidentally.
