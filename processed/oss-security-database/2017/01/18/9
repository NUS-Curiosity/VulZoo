Thanks for the info.

Ok, what I forgot to mention is a user-base. Our distribution is quite small, we
have about 7 thousand users. Our distribution runs on routers we gave away in
the past and new ones that we are selling and both have by default automatic
updates enabled - so they get updates including security ones quite soon after
we release them.

Thanks for the context, I understand it is a hard decision.

Hard to guess what is there. But basically before we release anything we do
test it, so from the point when we learn about the issue, it takes days to
release a fix (after commiting fix, we build binaries, do some testing and only
after that we release it for everybody). What is most important for us is I
would remotely exploitable kernel issues (here testing takes even more time),
openssl, openssh and lighttpd.

Yep, using it as one source of information about vulnerabilities we need to
fix. Was thinking how to respond to the contribution part, other mails helped
me to get some idea what can I do to improve. I admit that I'm new to this
field and I'm here mostly to learn about potential threads to our users.

Company I work for contributes to security in general, but probably not in this
specific community. I'm from CZ.NIC which among other stuff runs Czech CSIRT
team. But that is even different department. What we do in our team regarding
security is probably nothing that would help us to discover new
vulnerabilities. What we do is provide people option to send us firewall logs
and we use the results to build greylist[1] and we allow people to check
whether their IP tried to attack any of our users[2].

Personally, I'm not involved in those projects as I'm working most of the time
on our distribution. I asked for the membership as I would be the one handling
the issues on our end and I understand the need to limit the audience as much
as possible.

Thank you, I will reapply when that happens and in the meantime will think
about suggestions others posted about how to contribute back.
