   Use CVE-2016-10127 for any XXE vulnerability that exists within the
   pysaml2 code (i.e., not in an underlying library). This vulnerability
   is described in the "Oct 6, 2016" portion of the
   https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2/issues/366 reference. There isn't yet
   a complete rationale for why the pysaml2 code itself should be
   considered responsible for XXE, or about what changes to the pysaml2
   code itself would resolve XXE. However, it is still potentially useful
   to track XXE at the pysaml2 level.
   
   The scope of this CVE does not include the various other issues that
   may be found in the above references:
   
    - it does not include any aspect of
      https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=772726 (CVE-2016-9318
      is applicable to that XXE discussion)
   
    - it does not include any vulnerabilities in the XML Security Library
      (xmlsec), such as ones that are now, or previously were, listed at
      https://github.com/lsh123/xmlsec/issues
   
    - it does not include any CWE-776 (Entity Expansion) issue fixed
      in 6e09a25d9b4b7aa7a506853210a9a14100b8bc9b. The ID for this
      CWE-776 problem in pysaml2 is CVE-2016-10149.
