Subject: [CVE-2017-9799] Apache Storm Possible Code Execution As A Different
 User 

Severity: High

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Storm 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3
Apache Storm 1.1.0

Description:
It was found that under some situations and configurations of storm it is theoretically possible for the owner of a topology to trick the supervisor to launch a worker as a different, non-root, user. In the worst case this could lead to secure credentials of the other user being compromised.  This vulnerability only applies to Apache Storm installations with security components enabled.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations:

- Upgrade to Apache Storm 1.0.4 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Storm 1.1.1 or later

Apache Storm 1.1.1 and 1.0.4 can be downloaded here:
