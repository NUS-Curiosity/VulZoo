CVE-2017-12850:
By altering form data an authenticated standard user can set a new
password for any other user (including the admin) to takeover the account.

Fix:
https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/commit/88dd6abbf3f519897f2f6280e95c9eec9123a4ae


CVE-2017-12851:
By altering form data an authenticated standard user can change the mail
address of the admin account to set a new password via "Forgot
password?" to takeover the admin account.
