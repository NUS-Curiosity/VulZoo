Hello Mitre, I'm glad to see your response here.

The problem is not about this duplicate but from some assignments in the last 
two months from people I mentioned, see the first post here from a partial 
list: https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=150401081512049&w=2

from https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/11/16/jasper-multiple-assertion-failure/ we have: 
libjasper/jpc/jpc_t1cod.c:144: int JPC_NOMINALGAIN(int, int, int, int): 
Assertion `qmfbid == 0x01′ failed.
form https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1485272 we have:
libjasper/jpc/jpc_t1cod.c:144: int JPC_NOMINALGAIN(int, int, int, int): 
Assertion `qmfbid == JPC_COX_RFT' failed.

they looks to be similar.

From your side looks to be correct, What I'm trying to point out is to not 
trust at all cve-requests that never went under upstream eyes.

This is right from your side, but looks to be false in the reality. The cve 
was issued on 07/28/2017 while the first comment from upstream was on 
08/13/2017 (https://sourceforge.net/p/lame/bugs/460/). Again do not entirely 
trust request that never went under upstream eyes.

As said to Henri in my previous email, the problem is not the FPE itself or 
something technical.
As you can clearly see I'm trying to include the asan output on each bug I 
find, to make it easily-comparable and sometimes you can easily understand the 
cause/nature of the issue. Unfortunately people do not do the same and this 
causes the presence of duplicates.
