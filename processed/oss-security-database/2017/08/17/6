            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2017-12135 / XSA-226
                               version 6

               multiple problems with transitive grants

UPDATES IN VERSION 6
====================

Patches actually addressing the issue have become ready.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

1) Code to handle copy operations on transitive grants has built in
   retry logic, involving a function reinvoking itself with unchanged
   parameters.  Such use assumes that the compiler would also translate
   this to a so called "tail call" when generating machine code.
   Empirically, this is not commonly the case, allowing for
   theoretically unbounded nesting of such function calls.

2) The reference counting and locking discipline for transitive grants
   is broken.  Concurrent use of the transitive grant can leak
   references on the transitively-referenced grant.

IMPACT
======

A malicious or buggy guest may be able to crash Xen.  Privilege
escalation and information leaks cannot be ruled out.  A malicious or
buggy guest can leak references on grants it has been given, amounting
to a DoS against the grantee.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no known mitigation.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

The security team would also like to thank Amazon for helping to identify that
the problems with transitive grants were deeper than originally believed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached pair of patches from the list below
addresses this issue:

xsa226-unstable/*.patch     xen-unstable
xsa226-4.9/*.patch          Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x, Xen 4.7.x
xsa226-4.6/*.patch          Xen 4.6.x
xsa226-4.5/*.patch          Xen 4.5.x

Note that these patches have already been applied to the respective staging
trees.

Alternatively, applying the appropriate attached patch from the list
below works around this issue by disabling transitive grants by default:

xsa226.patch           xen-unstable, Xen 4.9.x, Xen 4.8.x
xsa226-4.7.patch       Xen 4.7.x
xsa226-4.6.patch       Xen 4.6.x
xsa226-4.5.patch       Xen 4.5.x

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
