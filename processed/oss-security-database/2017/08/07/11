 inotify_handle_event() and sys_rename()

Hello, Brad,

Indeed, the wording "in the wild" is probably incorrect. The mentioned exploit was developed by the
flaw researchers and we are not aware of it being available to or used by anyone else. We are sorry
for this misinformation.

As for the timeline as we understand it, we were notified about the flaw, we've discovered the flaw
being actually already fixed in the upstream, we've notified linux-distros@ and in a week we've made
this public announce.

Best regards,
Vladis Dronov | Red Hat, Inc. | Product Security Engineer
