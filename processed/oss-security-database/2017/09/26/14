Subject: CVE-2017-7687: Libprocess might crash when decoding a malformed request.

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Mesos 1.1.0 to 1.3.0
The unsupported Apache Mesos 1.0.x as well as 0.x versions may be also
affected.

Description:
When handling a decoding failure for a malformed URL path of an HTTP
request, libprocess might crash because the code accidentally calls
inappropriate function. A malicious actor can therefore cause a denial
of service of Mesos masters rendering the Mesos-controlled cluster
inoperable.

Mitigation:
pre-1.1.x users should upgrade to at least 1.1.3
1.1.x users should upgrade to 1.1.3
1.2.x users should upgrade to 1.2.2
1.3.0 users should upgrade to 1.3.1
1.4.0-dev users should obtain Mesos 1.4.0
