Subject: Xen Security Advisory 231 (CVE-2017-14316) - Missing NUMA node
 parameter verification

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2017-14316 / XSA-231
                               version 3

               Missing NUMA node parameter verification

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Updated metadata file

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The function `alloc_heap_pages` allows callers to specify the first
NUMA node that should be used for allocations through the `memflags`
parameter; the node is extracted using the `MEMF_get_node` macro.

While the function checks to see if the special constant
`NUMA_NO_NODE` is specified, it otherwise does not handle the case
where `node >= MAX_NUMNODES`.  This allows an out-of-bounds access
to an internal array.

IMPACT
======

An attacker using crafted hypercalls can execute arbitrary code within
Xen.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All versions of Xen are affected.

Both ARM and x86 are affected.

Both systems running HVM guests and system running PV guests are
affected.

MITIGATION
==========

No known mitigation.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Matthew Daley.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
