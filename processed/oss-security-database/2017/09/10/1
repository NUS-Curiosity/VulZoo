Can you clarify the affected versions? I noticed while looking at the
above, that MITRE description mentions "Qemu 2.8.0 through 2.9.0". I
perfectly realize those does not come from the above.  As far as I can
see, e.g. cpu_physical_memory_snapshot_get_dirty was only introduced
in v2.10.0-rc0. The upstream commit associated with the above issue
is:

 https://git.qemu.org/gitweb.cgi?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=bfc56535f793c557aa754c50213fc5f882e6482d

which fixes

 https://git.qemu.org/gitweb.cgi?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=fec5e8c92becad223df9d972770522f64aafdb72

introducing the use of dirty bitmap snapshots in vga_draw_graphic().

Do I miss something makeing it affecting as well earlier versions than
2.10?

Regards and thanks already for your help,
Salvatore
