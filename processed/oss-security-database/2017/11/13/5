Ok, not a problem, thanks for the apology.

So the answer is just "we've decided to", right?

If so, that's fine, you are allowed to do so being a CNA, but what is
keeping you from doing the same for the thousands of other bugs that
have been fixed since this one that is in a specific Red Hat product?

It's the arbitrarily nature here that I am curious about, it feels like
it should be "all or nothing", for CVEs to mean much here.  Right now it
seems like it is just, "all that we care to track"?  :)
