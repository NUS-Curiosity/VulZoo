Kernel maintainers' policy is clear, and nobody is asking for that to
change, but please don't sandbag the process of keeping track of
vulnerabilities.  The fraction of "products" (regardless of vendor)
that run linux and never get updates approaches unity.  Being able to
precisely catalog which linux releases suffer from which
vulnerabilities is useful to many.
