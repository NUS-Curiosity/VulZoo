Using the executable bit was wrong (in my opinion) for one main reason:
the .desktop files aren't actually executable. By marking them +x, you
screw up programs (like bash) that care about the executable bit. There
is now also the issue that you've reported, where the executable bit is
preserved by tar -- we have to assume that the GUI will do something
stupid like hide the file extension.

The last time I thought about this, I came up with something that sounds
spiritually similar to what Nautilus has done. Using Thunar as my file
manager -- suppose I download a file called /home/mjo/malware.desktop
that contains (from your bug report),

  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=CV.pdf
  Exec=sh -c 'touch ./MALWARE_WAS_HERE'
  Terminal=false
  Icon=x-office-document
  Type=Application
  Categories=Office

I don't want to rely on the executable bit, and I don't want to use any
gvfs magic. Instead, when I click on malware.desktop, Thunar should
check for the existence of

  /home/mjo/.local/share/Thunar/home/mjo/malware.desktop           (1)

and then handle two cases,

  i) if the file does exist, and if it's executable, execute it.

  ii) otherwise, prompt me for whether or not I want to run the thing

      ii.a) if I say "no", then do nothing

      ii.b) if I say yes, then create the file at (1) containing

              #!/bin/sh
              sh -c 'touch ./MALWARE_WAS_HERE'

            and mark it executable before running it.

That way, the only thing that gets +x is *actually* executable. The
"metadata" is still associated with the file path, but needs no magic
beyond the ability to execute a shell script.

This idea is probably full of holes, but nobody who's qualified to fix
this clicks on pictures to run programs =P

Obvious caveats:

  1) The file manager would have to substitute "%f" and friends into the
     shell script and get the quoting right.

  2) The path in (1) doesn't change when the file's contents do; a real
     implementation would want to include a hash or something, like

       /home/mjo/.local/share/Thunar/home/mjo/malware.desktop/<sha512>

     The Nautilus implementation might be vulnerable to swapping the
     contents of the file.. the gvfs metadata is supposedly path-based,
     but I know nothing about it.

  3) This will prompt every user the first time he runs a system
     executable that has a .desktop entry. That should be easy to
     solve, though, by using a system location such as
     /var/lib/Thunar/<path>/<sha512> and by having the file manager look
     there first. Distros would simply install the shell script and mark
     it executable.
