This is not the "only drawback".  Among other things, such configuration
fails very badly when network mounts are involved.

 - If the swap directory is shared between multiple hosts (e.g., $HOME
   is NFS-mounted), then you will get false positives when editing files
   that happen to share a filename on different hosts.

 - If the file being edited is shared between multiple hosts, then you
   will get false negatives when trying to edit that file from different
   hosts.

Or a combination of the two scenarios.  In the default mode, network
mounts basically work as expected because the swapfile location is
shared the same way.

Cheers,
