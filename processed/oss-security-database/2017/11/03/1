That's usually true but it doesn't matter because a security assertion made
via umask is being violated, so it wins a CVE. Also for example if you
later delete that file and think you're safe the copy is still floating
around world readable. Or you have something indexing the files and
ignoring that file type, and the .swp gets indexed, and so on.
