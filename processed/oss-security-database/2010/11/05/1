If the code is the same, then you can reuse the CVE id. We see this for
example when various PDF CVE ids get shared between xpdf and poppler.

If it's the same flaw, but essentially different code, they need new IDs.

is the parent of what upstream currently has.

If you think it needs some though, let me know.
