Subject: CVE-2010-3699 xen: guest->host denial of service from invalid xenbus
 transitions

A guest can cause the backend driver to leak a kernel thread. Such 
leaked threads hold references to the device, which makes the device 
impossible to tear down. If shut down, the guest remains a zombie 
domain, the xenwatch process hangs, and most xm commands will stop working.
