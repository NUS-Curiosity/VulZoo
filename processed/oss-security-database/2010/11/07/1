While many of the sources for YUI imply that there's only one XSS, one of 
our CVE analysts observed that the "Affected Files and Patches" section at 
the end of http://yuilibrary.com/support/2.8.2/ makes it clear that three 
separate .SWF files are affected, and they are all patched in slightly 
different versions.

So, I'm going to REJECT CVE-2010-3866 and SPLIT it into the following 3 
CVEs:

CVE-2010-4207
charts/assets/charts.swf
YUI 2.4.0 through 2.8.1


CVE-2010-4208
uploader/assets/uploader.swf
YUI 2.5.0 through 2.8.1


CVE-2010-4209
swfstore/swfstore.swf
YUI 2.8.0 through 2.8.1

This lack of information is a fairly common problem.  Generally, we take 
the approach of assuming that such changes are related to vulnerabilities 
that originate from the third-party package, but sometimes the 
vulnerability is in glue code from the main package to the third-party 
package, so there are limitations to this assumption.
