Great. There's plenty of precedent for CVE assignment to vulnerabilities
that leak information that can assist an attacker in exploitation.

In particular, I'm thinking about the handful of ASLR information leaks
(eg. CVE-2009-2691 [1]), where userspace addresses are leaked via /proc,
assisting an attacker in exploiting a vulnerability in a setuid
userspace binary.

In this case, we have an analogous situation, except that we're leaking
kernel address via /proc, assisting an attacker in exploiting
vulnerability in the kernel.

I don't see any reason why it would not be entirely appropriate to
assign a CVE here.
