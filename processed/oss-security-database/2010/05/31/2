Subject: SFCB vulnerabilities

Hi,

SFCB v1.3.8 fixes two remotely exploitable vulnerabilities (3001896 and
3001915 in httpAdapter.c) :
http://sblim.cvs.sourceforge.net/sblim/sfcb/ChangeLog?view=markup

CVE-2010-1937 was privately assigned to entry 3001896 but I still don't
have a CVE id for 3001915. Could you please assign one before I release
the technical advisory ?

Regards,
Nicolas Grégoire / Agarri
