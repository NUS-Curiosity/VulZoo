Subject: CVE assignment: ghostscript stack-based overflow


FYI.  The researcher told me that some distros were notified 
pre-disclosure, but I had already assigned this CVE when I found out.


======================================================
Name: CVE-2010-1869
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1869
Reference: MISC:http://www.checkpoint.com/defense/advisories/public/2010/cpai-10-May.html

Stack-based buffer overflow in the parser function in GhostScript 8.70
and 8.64 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a crafted PostScript file.
