Subject: Re: CVE request: lxr

Just to clarify, two XSS bugs were fixed with a single release (new
version 0.9.8), and then ten days later, an update was included to
resolve a third XSS bug.  The original CVE was originally requested
for "multiple XSS vulnerabilities", but the description only covers
one of them.
