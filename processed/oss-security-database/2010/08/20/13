All,

I agree that these are duplicates.  This arose out of an oddity in the CVE 
content production process, the specifics of which I'm still trying to 
figure out.  Basically we have multiple internal "production streams" 
where CVE-2010-1448 was processed through one stream, and CVE-2010-1738 
through another.  The original CVE confusion that happened in May 2010 no 
doubt complicated things.

Prefer CVE-2010-1448.  I have REJECTED CVE-2010-1738.
