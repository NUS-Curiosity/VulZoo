Yes, that's what I was referring to.

b) is likely to require per-application CVE.  With the changed default,
one won't need to care about them though.  I agree c) should better get
a separate CVE if it's not what CVE-2010-2055 text already tries to
describe, given the "related to improper support for the -P- option"
part.
