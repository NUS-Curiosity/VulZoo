Based on this, I'd say the buffer overflow CVE-2010-3844 is probably
extraneous.  The only attack vector is due to the fact that the
configuration file is globally accessible, so I would argue that, just
like your example of SQL injection allowing XSS, the insecure
temporary file usage allows the buffer overflow.  Given that the
configuration file is hidden by default, I'd assume that there is no
intention of allowing users to share configurations - I think it's
only supposed to maintain settings between consecutive executions on
the same machine.
