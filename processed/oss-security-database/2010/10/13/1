Subject: CVE Request -- cURL / mingw32-cURL -- Did not strip directory parts
 separated by backslashes, when downloading files

Hello Steve, vendors,

   cURL upstream has released new curl / libcurl v7.21.2 addressing one security flaw,
specific for operating systems, where backslashes are used to separate directories from
file names. More details follow:

cURL did not properly cut off directory parts from user provided
file name to be downloaded on operating systems, where backslashes
are used to separate directories and file names. This could allow
remote servers to create or overwrite files via a Content-Disposition
header that suggests a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary
code as a consequence of writing to a certain file in a user's home
directory. Different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2251, CVE-2010-2252
and CVE-2010-2253.

Note: As already mentioned in [2]. This flaw only affected those
       operating systems, where backslash is used to separate directories
       and file names, thus Microsoft Windows, Novell Netware, MSDOS, OS/2
       and Symbian to mention some of them.
