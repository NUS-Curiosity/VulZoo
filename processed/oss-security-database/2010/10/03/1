The patch that fixes CVE-2010-3430 and CVE-2010-3431 was just made public:
http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=pam_modutil_priv

Besides that, another two issues have been fixed in pam_xauth after
Linux-PAM 1.1.2 release:

In pam_sm_close_session(), the attempt to unlink cookie file was made
without dropping privileges at all if target uid could not be determined:
http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=Linux-PAM-1_1_2-3-g05dafc0

In check_acl(), there were no check that the acl file provided by target
user is a regular file:
http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=Linux-PAM-1_1_2-2-gffe7058
