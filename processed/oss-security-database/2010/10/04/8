If I'm understanding this correctly based off
http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2010-October/053452.html

There are two issues here:

a) If admin wanted to remove some rights from mailboxes in user's
private namespace (e.g. symlinked shared mailboxes), they may not have
gotten removed.

Use CVE-2010-3706 for this one.


b) When mixing up multiple ACL entries, such as groups/users the more
specific entry may not have replaced the previous entry (e.g.
group-override may not have worked as expected).

Use CVE-2010-3707.

Thanks.
