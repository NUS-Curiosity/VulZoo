Subject: qpidd SSL connection DoS (CVE-2010-3083)

Just a heads up for anyone that ships qpid.  About a year and a half
ago a blocking condition was found with SSL connections to qpidd, but I
don't think upstream really thought about the security implications.

It was fixed upstream in July 2009.

The details are in our bug:
