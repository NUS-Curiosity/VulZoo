Subject: CVE request: Apache Axis2 Session Fixation

Hi,

there has recently been a Session Fixation vulnerability reported in Apache 
Axis2, see:

References:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS2-4739
http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/511955/30/30/threaded

There is already CVE-2010-2103 assigned for the Cross-Site Scripting mentioned 
in the advisory above. However, there does not seem to be a CVE for the 
Session Fixation flaw, so could you possibly assign one for it too?

Thanks!

ciao,
Matthias
