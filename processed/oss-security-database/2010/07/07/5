Use CVE-2010-2653

Let's ignore the default case.  If there's a feature that's available to 
some set of users, no matter how small, then CVE assignment is reasonable, 
even if it's not the default.  It's not much different than if you have an 
issue that only affects a particular chip set or compiler.
