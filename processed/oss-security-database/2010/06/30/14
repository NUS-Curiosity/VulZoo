Subject: Re: CVE requests: LibTIFF

There are three issues that I think are CVE-worthy and have not been assigned:

1.  OOB read in TIFFExtractData() leading to crash (no reference,
originally disclosed by me in this thread, fixed upstream with release
3.9.4 and security fix backported by Ubuntu).

2.  NULL pointer dereference due to invalid td_stripbytecount leading
to crash (distinct from CVE-2010-2443).  The upstream changelog entry
for 3.9.4 reads:

	* libtiff/tif_ojpeg.c (OJPEGReadBufferFill): Report an error and
	avoid a crash if the input file is so broken that the strip
	offsets are not defined.

3.  OOB read in TIFFRGBAImageGet() leading to crash.  Reference:
