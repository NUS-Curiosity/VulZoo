The BONSAI-2010-0105 references two problems, one for ping.php and another 
one having to do with a "Vertical Label" in a "Graph Template."

I don't see evidence of this vector in the revisions listed above.  Does 
anybody else?

(If the "Vertical Label" issue went unpatched, then a separate CVE should 
probably be assigned to it.)
