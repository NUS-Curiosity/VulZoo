Thanks for your help Tomas, it's hard to keep all these issues straight.

Revision 1.92.2.9 of libtiff/tif_dirread.c added code for ensuring
valid tag type information for each TIFF directory entry.  Prior to
this fix, unknown tag types would result in an out-of-bounds array
index in TIFFExtractData() on any code path using this macro.  Ubuntu
security backported this fix as debian/patches/fix-unknown-tags.patch
in their libtiff4 package.

Sorry, I misread your comment on the Launchpad post - by "buffer
over-read", I now understand that you meant that libtiff attempted to
read well past the boundaries of a buffer, resulting in an
out-of-bounds read and application crash.  My mistake.
