Subject: Fix for CVE-2010-4524 and CVE-2010-1677 ready for verfication

I've committed in a potential fix, and made a
snapshot build that should address the following
recent security issues:

  CVE-2010-4524
  CVE-2010-1677

Snapshot release is available at the following location:

  http://www.mhonarc.org/release/MHonArc/dist/

Any build dated 2010-12-30, or later, will contain the
fix.

I ask the interested parties verify that the fix addresses
concerns raised as I would like to make a formal release
as soon as possible.

Summary of fix:

  mhtxthtml.pl filter modified to reject any message with
  nested tags. This is invalid HTML, so any message
  that contains it would likely indicate a possible attack.

Whenever a formal, public, announcement of these vulnerabilities
are raise, please include link to the MHonArc FAQ that discusses
the security risks of HTML mail and how to disable HTML mail
in mhonarc archives:

  http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/faq/security.html#htmldata
  http://www.mhonarc.org/MHonArc/doc/faq/security.html#htmlexchow

This may be useful for users who may not be able to upgrade
to the latest release, but need a work-around solution to secure
their sites.

Thanks,
