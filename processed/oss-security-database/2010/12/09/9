I just assigned CVE-2006-7243 to the http://bugs.php.net/39863 issue, i.e. 
NULL injection in file_exists() *only*.

However, as already stated, the issue of NULL byte injection with PHP 
dates back to 1999 or so (ouch... I remember that).  If PHP is addressing 
NULL byte injection beyond just file_exists(), then that may need a 
separate CVE.
