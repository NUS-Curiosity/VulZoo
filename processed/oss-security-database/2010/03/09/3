   any progress while assigning CVE ids for these issues?

   From what I can tell, two should be enough:
   a, libESMTP doesn't properly handle NULL character in Common Name

     References:
       http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2408
       http://ioactive.com/pdfs/PKILayerCake.pdf (issue 2c)

   b, libESMTP's match_component() accepts two strings as equal
      if they start equal but don't have equal length => cert forgery

   Kees, please correct me, if I omitted something.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
