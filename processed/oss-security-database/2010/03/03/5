Subject: OpenSSL (with KRB5) remote crash - CVE-2010-0433

Hi!

We've been pointed out to public reports of remote SSL server crashes
in OpenSSL builds with kerberos support, triggered by the Nessus'
ssl_supported_ciphers test.

We've managed to track this problem to a missing return value check,
causing incorrect input to be passed to the krb5 library, resulting in
NULL pointer dereference crash in krb5 (recent MIT krb5 versions).

Issue can be reproduced with chrooted SSL servers (such as dovecot's
login process or chrooted stunnel).

Report we got, with references to previous public discussions:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=567711

Details of the flaw:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=569774

Upstream patch:
  http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=19374

We've assigned CVE-2010-0433 to this issue.
