Subject: CVE Request: libesmtp does not check NULL bytes in commonName

Hello,

I just noticed that libesmtp does not appear to handle NULL-byte CNs, as
seen with the original browser-based issue:
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2408

Related to this are failures in wildcard handling:
 http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=311191
and CN-specificity:
 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=510202

Though it may be a non-issue if TLS doesn't function at all:
 http://bugs.gentoo.org/213066
