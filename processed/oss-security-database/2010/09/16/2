Subject: CVE-2010-3081 kernel: 64-bit Compatibility Mode Stack Pointer Underflow

Reported by Ben Hawkes. "A vulnerability in the 32-bit compatibility 
layer for 64-bit systems was reported. It is caused by insecure 
allocation of user space memory when translating system call inputs to 
64-bit. A stack pointer underflow can occur when using the 
"compat_alloc_user_space" method with an arbitrary length input."
