Subject: CVE request: clamav < 0.96.3 pdf bounds checking

As always, clamav doesn't mention security issues in it's release notes, but 
the changelog gives some insight.

The bundled bzip2 code is affected by CVE-2010-0405 which is no surprise.

This however sounds more interesting:
Mon Sep 20 14:50:34 EEST 2010 (edwin)
-------------------------------------
 * libclamav/pdf.c: Add missing boundscheck to pdf code (bb #2226)

The referenced bug report is not public, but it sounds like this deserves a 
CVE.
