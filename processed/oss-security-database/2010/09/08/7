Subject: CVE-2010-3080 kernel: /dev/sequencer open failure is not handled
 correctly

Reported by Tavis Ormandy. There's a bug in snd_seq_oss_open from 
sound/core/seq/oss/seq_oss_init.c that can result in dereferencing of a 
released pointer. On some distros like Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 
/dev/sequencer is restricted to root owner only. On others like Fedora 
13, it cannot be accessed by a local, unprivileged user unless someone 
logs in from the console on his/her behalf.

Thanks, Eugene
