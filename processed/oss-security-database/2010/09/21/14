Subject: Re: CVE request: padding oracle attack: ruby on rails
 2.3, owasp esapi


When it comes to language interpreters and/or code libraries: if an 
exposed API function has a vuln in it that could affect any application 
that uses that function, it's suitable for inclusion in CVE - especially 
if the function seems likely to accept malicious input.  If there's *no 
way* that these API functions can be used safely, then that would be 
associated with Rails, and a single CVE could be assigned.  If they *can* 
be used safely, but lots of different programmers just screw it up (a la 
strcpy() in C), then the individual applications would get their own 
separate CVEs.

In this case, while the issue is probably not a problem for the bulk of 
Rails programmers, it might be for some - so a single CVE assignment seems 
reasonable.

Hope that made sense.

- Steve
