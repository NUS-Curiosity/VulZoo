In this case, all else being equal, lowest ID wins.

We will never be perfect due to the lack of sufficient details (or, way 
too many details), but where possible I prefer to follow the consistency 
rules when we can, especially when they're pretty clear-cut like this.

It happens :-)

In this case, the abstraction issue was discovered quickly, so I'm OK with 
fixing the abstraction after the fact.

Let's stick with CVE-2010-3089, and I'll flag CVE-2010-3090 for rejection.
