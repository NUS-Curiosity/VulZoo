Not confirming :)
The patch you referenced has a changeset comment
"
  Fixed a initialization order remark by Serg : correct directory
  expansion order implemented on server startup.
"

And it fixes a problem mentined in my bug comment from [14 Jul 15:53].

The changelog entry you quoted above goes up to bug comment from
[25 Nov 2008 17:26] (no, I don't know why it took a year to get it to
the manual). And the "original fix" is apparently this one:

http://lists.mysql.com/commits/43206 (from 2008-02-29)

while the "additional" is this:

http://lists.mysql.com/commits/52326 (from 2008-08-22)

cannot this one go under existing CVE ?
