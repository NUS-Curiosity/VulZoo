We assigned some CVE names for the new issues here; two correspond to 
existing issues fixed earlier in 5.2.11.  The CVE names have not made it 
to the web site but were used in the e-mail announcement text:

- Added missing sanity checks around exif processing. (CVE-2009-3292, Ilia)
- Fixed a safe_mode bypass in tempnam() identified by Grzegorz Stachowiak.
  (CVE-2009-3557, Rasmus)
- Fixed a open_basedir bypass in posix_mkfifo() identified by Grzegorz
  Stachowiak. (CVE-2009-3558, Rasmus)
- Fixed bug #50063 (safe_mode_include_dir fails). (CVE-2009-3559,
  Johannes, christian at elmerot dot se)
- Fixed bug #44683 (popen crashes when an invalid mode is passed).
  (CVE-2009-3294, Pierre)
