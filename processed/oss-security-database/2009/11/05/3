Subject: CVE-2009-3555 for TLS renegotiation MITM attacks

http://extendedsubset.com/?p=8 
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg03948.html and so on
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=533125

Marsh Ray of PhoneFactor has discovered a flaw in the TLS/SSL protocol 
related to the handling of the session renegotiations.  In certain 
circumstances this flaw could be used in MITM attacks, allowing an 
attacker to inject attacker-chosen plain text prefix into a secure session 
of the victim.

Thanks, Mark
