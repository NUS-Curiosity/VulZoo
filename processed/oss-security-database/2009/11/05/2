Subject: CVE Request - Asterisk (AST-2009-008.html)

Hello Steve, vendors,

   Asterisk upstream has recently published two security advisories:

a, SIP responses expose valid usernames
    http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2009-008.html

    This is similar issue to AST-2009-003.html (CVE-2008-3903)
    http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2009-003.html

    But according to the patches:

    http://downloads.digium.com/pub/asa/AST-2009-003-1.6.1.diff.txt (AST-2009-003) vs
    http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2009-008-1.6.1.diff.txt (AST-2009-003)

    it desires a new CVE id. Could you allocate one?

The second issue (b,) already got an CVE id of CVE-2008-7220.

b, Cross-site AJAX request vulnerability (CVE-2008-7220)
    http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2009-009.html

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
