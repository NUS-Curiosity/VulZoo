   Thank you for pointing this out.

   Yes, further look into particular php bugzilla returns:

     "Environment variables specified for proc_open passed without check so
      safe_mode_allowed_env_vars and safe_mode_protected_env_vars settings are
      ignored. So it become possible to use buffer overflow exploit with
      "LD_PRELOAD=evil_library.so" to bypass safe_mode restrictions and get
      access to any files acessible for apache uid."

   So looks another CVE id is needed here. Changed subject to:
   "CVE request: php 5.3.1 - proc_open() bypass PHP Bug #49026"

   Could we get another CVE id for this case?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
