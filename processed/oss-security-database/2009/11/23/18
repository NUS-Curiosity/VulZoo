The same core problem could be solved any number of ways, and I don't
think that should distract from the fact that there is just one core
problem.  So using the same CVE is appropriate.  (Now, if an interim fix
is later found to have its own vulns or be bypassed in a way that was not
originally advertised, that might need its own CVE.)
