Attached are preliminary patches for 2.4.1, 2.0.4 and 1.2.9 backported
from the advisory[1]. This is a first pass, have only been very lightly
tested and have not been thoroughly looked at (you've been warned). They
are not intended for production use yet, but hopefully others will be
able to use them and provide feedback.

2.0.4 and 1.2.9 needed an additional patch[2] which adds wide wildcard
hostname matching. Ubuntu will likely carry this patch, but it may not
be appropriate for everyone. 2.x passes the nul-in-x509-names.c test
mentioned in the advisory. 1.2.9 does not pass the CN test yet, though
at first glance certtool output looks comparable to the others. These
patches are against Ubuntu sources and not clean tarballs.
