Right.  If you and others provide patches for older versions, I can
apply them on the git branches.  Someone could even volunteer to become
old-releases-maintainer and do it for me.  It would indeed be useful if
all vendors could look into the git repository to find the recommended
patch for any version, rather than everyone having to spend time on
identifying and testing patches by themselves.  Alas, I don't have
resources to do this, and I believe my time is best spent on maintaining
the stable and development branches.
