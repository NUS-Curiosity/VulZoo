Subject: [oCERT-2009-009] CamlImages integer overflows


#2009-009 CamlImages integer overflows

Description:

CamlImages, an open source image processing library, suffers from several
integer overflows which may lead to a potentially exploitable heap overflow and
result in arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability is triggered by PNG image parsing, the read_png_file and
read_png_file_as_rgb24 functions do not properly validate the width and height
of the image. Specific PNG images with large width and height can be crafted
to trigger the vulnerability.

Affected version:

CamlImages <= 2.2

Fixed version:

Unfortunately oCERT has been unable to get feedback from CamlImages maintainers
and the package seems unmaintained, it's therefore suggested to avoid
CamlImages usage on production or any environment where strong security is
needed.
