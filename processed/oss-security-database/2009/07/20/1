Yeah.

Some "minor" bugs and one larger one.

The Linux folks have meanwhile:

- Fixed the actual bug. ;) (CVE-2009-1897)
  Only affects 2.6.30,2.6.30.1.

  2.6.30.2 release soon.

- Added -fno-delete-null-pointers to their Makefiles

  Also in 2.6.30.2 and 2.

- fixed the personality - PER_CLEAR_ON_SETTID inheritance issue (CVE-2009-1895)
  to work around mmap_min_addr protection.
  Affects 2.6.23-2.6.30.1

  2.6.30.2 and 2.6.27.x releases soon.

I am not sure about the SELinux policy error he used to 
exploit the RHEL 5.? Beta.

Ciao, Marcus
