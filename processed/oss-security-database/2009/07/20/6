It occurred to me, from a few things I've seen/read lately, that RHEL 5
must indeed already include a back-port of the mmap_min_addr feature,
although somehow it is not in OpenVZ's patch-128.1.1.el5.028stab062.3
(was added after the -128 revision?), which is why I am adding my own
back-port of mmap_min_addr on top of that patch.  I am not using genuine
RHEL 5 (nor CentOS), which is why I don't know.  Maybe Eugene can
comment on this.

Released, although I expect it to be replaced with 2.4.37.4-ow1 soon:
