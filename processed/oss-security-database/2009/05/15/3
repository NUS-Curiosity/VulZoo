Subject: CVE Request -- Eggdrop

Hello Steve,

  Thomas Sader yesterday reported, the original patch for original
stack-based buffer overflow flaw (CVE-2007-2807) in Eggdrop is
incomplete (might introduce another flaw). 

References:

(patch towards the latest version).

Could you allocate a new CVE id for it?

Thanks, Jan.
