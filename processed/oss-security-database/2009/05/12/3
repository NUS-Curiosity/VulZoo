I'm bit unsure about how to treat these form CVE point of view.  These
both happen during normal operation too.  However, attacker can cause
these leaks in some setups (ipsec server serving road warriors) without
being able to authenticate successfully, so this bears some exploitation
potential.  Given the previous ipsec-tools CVE assignments
(CVE-2008-3651/2), this may deserve CVE too.

Thoughts?
