Subject: mod-auth-mysql: SQL injection

Hi

The following issue can now be made public. Please note that this describes 
the software used in debian as mod-auth-mysql (binary name is 
libapache2-mod-auth-mysql). It is different from the SF project.

Package        : mod-auth-mysql
Vulnerability  : SQL injection vulnerability
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE Id         : CVE-2008-2384


Martin Joey Schulze discovered that mod-auth-mysq, an apache 2 module
for mysql authentication, is prone to an SQL injection due to
insufficient escaping mechanisms, when multybite character encodings are
used.

The link[0] points to the patch. Please credit Martin Joey Schulze for writing 
it.

Cheers
Steffen
