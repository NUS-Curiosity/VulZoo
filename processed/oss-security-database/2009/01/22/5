A new one is needed since (I assume) it's not a shared codebase between
Microsoft and the Linux distros.  A 2009 number is being used since the
announcement for this particular product was made in 2009.

Consider buffer overflows in FTP servers with a long username - same exact
bug, but at least 20 different implementations have been hit with it so
far.

Use CVE-2009-0259

The Word processor in OpenOffice.org 1.1.2 through 1.1.5 allows
remnote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) .doc, (2) .wri, or (3) .rtf
Word 97 file that triggers memory corruption, as exploited in the wild
in December 2008, as demonstrated by 2008-crash.doc.rar, and a similar
issue to CVE-2008-4841.
