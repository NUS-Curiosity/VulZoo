Subject: CVE-2009-0028 Linux kernel minor signal handling vulnerability

Reported by Chris Evans:
It's a relatively minor signal issue where a child can send its parent 
process an arbitrary signal, even if the parent has a totally separate 
real and effective user id. This could be a nuisance in the case where 
long-running root daemons spawn direct child processes owned by 
untrusted users [*]. There may even be worse consequences if privileged 
processes have weak signal handling code for signals not normally 
triggerable by untrusted users.

This is fixed in upstream kernel - 2d5516cbb9d
