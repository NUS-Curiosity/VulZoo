The response_addname function in response.c in Daniel J. Bernstein
djbdns 1.05 and earlier does not constrain offsets in the required
manner, which allows remote attackers, with control over a third-party
subdomain served by tinydns and axfrdns, to trigger DNS responses
containing arbitrary records via crafted zone data for this subdomain.
