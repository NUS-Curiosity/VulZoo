Subject: Re: CVE for recent cyrus-imap issue


CVE-2009-2628 has been clearly and publicly associated with VU#444513
which is for a VMware AVI codec heap overflow.  So it's not for cyrus-imap
at all.  (This may have been a typo somewhere down the line, and it's not
"live"  on the CVE site which didn't help things.)

As Nico said, CVE-2009-2632 appears to be the proper ID for the cyrus-imap
problem.  I am associating it with the SIEVE component overflow as
released in DEBIAN:DSA-1881.  If there's another bug floating around,
we'll have to use a different CVE.
