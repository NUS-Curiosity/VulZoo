Just a note: upstream page currently says the second issue is related
to CVE-2007-2138, but our maintainer also active upstream reports it
should say CVE-2007-6600.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=522085#c1

I can't confirm either atm, so just a heads-up to avoid possible
confusion related to CVE wording.
