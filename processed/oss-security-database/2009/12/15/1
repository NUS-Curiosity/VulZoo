Subject: CVE-2009-4138 kernel: firewire: ohci: handle receive packets with
 a data length of zero

Anyone who can open any of the /dev/fw* files on recent version of the 
new firewire stack can trigger a NULL pointer dereference with ohci 1.0 
controllers (or ohci 1.1 controllers that are being used in ohci 1.0 
mode because of hardware bugs) by issuing certain ioctls.

On machines with non-blacklisted ohci1.1 controllers, the call does 
nothing, which is a bug.
