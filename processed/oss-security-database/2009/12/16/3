Subject: NetworkManager CVE assignment

I just assigned two CVE ids for NetworkManager:

CVE-2009-4144 Possible connections to spoofed WPA Enterprise networks without validating network certificate
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=546795


CVE-2009-4145 Information disclosure by nm-connection-editor
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=546117


These were somewhat public before now.

Thanks.
