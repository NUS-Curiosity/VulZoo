Hi Steve,

The two CVE names were assigned when this issue was reported in 
vendor-sec (forwarded you the email; I should have cc'ed you but I 
missed it, sorry). When it was reported, the reporter combined two 
patches into one, but the upstream committed them in two separate 
patches: upstream commits 4253119a and 827d42c9.

There are two issues in commit 827d42c9. The first issue (problem) was 
assigned CVE-2009-4026, and the second issue (problem) was assigned 
CVE-2009-4027. Commit 4253119a should be associated with CVE-2009-4026 
because the fix is also for an issue that was introduced by d75636ef 
(which is related to the first issue).

Commits 4253119a and 827d42c9 (first problem) = CVE-2009-4026
Commit 827d42c9 (second problem) = CVE-2009-4027

Thanks, Eugene
