Use CVE-2009-4303

This will be focused on the storage of passwords and secrets in backups; 
the remainder are considered defense-in-depth changes and not being 
considered for CVE.  (Arguments welcome.)

Use CVE-2009-4304

This will focus on the lack of password salt; the remainder are considered 
defense-in-depth changes and not being considered for CVE.  (Arguments 
welcome.)

a CVE.

Use CVE-2009-4305


Descriptions will be filled in later.
