     mac80211: RX aggregation: clean up stop session

The problem is that the BUG_ON moved before the various checks, and as 
such can be triggered.

As the comment indicates, the BUG_ON can be removed since the 
ampdu_action callback must already exist when the state is OPERATIONAL.

A similar code path leads to a WARN_ON in ieee80211_stop_tx_ba_session, 
which can also be removed."

Btw, FYI, there's another issue that was also introduced by the same 
code shuffling patch (commit d75636ef) but was fixed in another patch 
(commit 827d42c9). It was assigned with CVE-2009-4026.

Thanks, Eugene
