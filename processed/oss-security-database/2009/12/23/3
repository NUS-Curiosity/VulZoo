That statement is based on investigation using info / patches /
reproducers from the mozilla bugs.  I did not do that work, so I can't
give you any more details and I do not have access to the bugs, but the
summary was that the flaws did not exist in 1.0alpha versions we ship
and are already fixed in 1.1.0.
