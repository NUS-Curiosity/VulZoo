Agree.  This change, however, seems to have a minimal impact on today's 
real world PHP applications.  Certificate verification is not enabled by
default and there seem to be very few applications that actually enable
it.  I have some notes in:

There are 3 changes in the upstream path:
- missing header length check, with similar impact as CVE-2009-2687 in
  the worst case
- missing nesting level checks for TIFFs, crafted file can lead to deep
  recursion exhausting stack memory resulting in rather harmless crash
- missing EOF checks, possibly leading to NULL deref or PHP memory
  limit exception
