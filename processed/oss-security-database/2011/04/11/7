Subject: Re: pure-ftpd STARTTLS command injection / new CVE?

:http://www.pureftpd.org/project/pure-ftpd/news
:
:states that pure-ftpd is affected by the same STARTTLS
:injection bug as postifx's CVE-2011-0411.
:
:Is this CVE postfix-specific or can it be used for
:pure-ftpd as well? If needed, can someone assign a new CVE?

It should get its own CVE assignment.  Other products with the
same STARTTLS issue have gotten unique CVE assignments for them
-- see CVE-2011-143[012].
