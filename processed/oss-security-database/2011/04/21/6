Subject: CVE request: CVE-2011-1089-like flaw in mount.nfs

A similar issue to CVE-2011-1089 was found in mount.nfs because it uses
it's own addmntent() implementation to update /etc/mtab
(nfs_addmntend()).  It also fails to anticipate resource limits and
could trigger corruption of the mtab file.

For more details see:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=697975

Could a CVE name be assigned to this issue please?  Thanks.
