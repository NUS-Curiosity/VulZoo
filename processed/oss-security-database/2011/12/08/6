Looking around I did find:

http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/3/html/Reference_Guide/s1-pam-config-files.html

=====================
15.2.1. PAM Service Files

Each PAM-aware application or service has a file within the /etc/pam.d/
directory. Each file within this directory bears the name of the service
for which it controls access.

It is up to the PAM-aware program to define its service name and install
its own PAM configuration file in the /etc/pam.d/ directory. For
example, the login program defines its service name as login and
installs the /etc/pam.d/login PAM configuration file.
=====================

so to some degree it is defined: the service name must fit legal file
name constraints, but this means things like length, but on ext4 for
example this means 256 chars max, and only NULL and "/" are disallowed,
to say nothing of other file systems like xfs (any bytes except null)
and Joliet (CDFS, max 64 characters, unicode supported[1])

So perhaps going for a lowest common denominator of common filesystems
you'd expect to find /etc/ on (so ext4, xfs, maybe Joliet for cd based
systems?) as a filter would be appropriate? And poking the PAM people to
refine the specification a little bit? Thoughts or comments anyone?
