Subject: CVE Request -- phpLDAPadmin -- Local file inclusion flaw in "common.php"
 via "Accept-Language" HTTP header leading to DoS

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   a local file inclusion flaw was found in the way the phpLDAPadmin,
a web based LDAP client for managing LDAP servers, processed certain
values of the "Accept-Language" HTTP header. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to cause a denial of service (generate recursive 
inclusions leading to resource exhaustion) via specially-crafted request.

Note: A different issue than CVE-2011-4075 (due the different
       attack vector and different source code file in question).

According to Dmitry, this issue should be fixed in upstream v0.9.8.5
version too.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
