Subject: CVE-2011-3979 being duplicate of CVE-2011-3352

Hello Steve, Josh,

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in
ztemp/view_compiled/Theme/theme_admin_setasdefault.php in the theme
module in Zikula Application Framework 1.3.0 build 3168, 1.2.7, and
probably other versions allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary
web script or HTML via the themename parameter in the setasdefault
action to index.php.

The security focus link URL in the second assignment is slightly
different, but the content of that post seems to be the same.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-3352
suggests there are three ways / attack vectors, how to exploit this:
a) via specially-crafted 'themename' parameter in 'setasdefault.php'
    script,
b) via specially-crafted 'themename' parameter in modify theme script
    and,
c) via specially-crafted 'themename' parameter in delete theme script.

So since CVE-2011-3979 description explicitly mentions 'set as default',
should this (CVE-2011-3979) identifier be considered to refer only to
'set as default' case (a) in the above) or are the CVE-2011-3352 and
CVE-2011-3979 just CVE duplicates for the same issue?

If the latter holds, which is the correct one (assuming the higher one
is valid, thus CVE-2011-3979) to use for issue referencing purposes?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
