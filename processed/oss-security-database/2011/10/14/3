Indeed, if privsep_init() fails the only visible change would be no
future changes to interface settings.  I was misled by the option name -
it looks like privsep disabling (opposition to --username), but in
reality it totally disables privileged operations.

Thanks for spotting it, I think CVE-2011-3603 should be rejected.
