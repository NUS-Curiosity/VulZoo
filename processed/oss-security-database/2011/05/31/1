Subject: CVE-2011-1763 kernel: xen: improper upper boundary check in get_free_port()
 function

A flaw was found in the way Xen hypervisor checked for upper boundary
when getting a new event channel port. A privileged DomU user could use
this flaws to cause denial of service or, possibly, increase his privileges.

AFAIK, upstream xen is not affected.
