Subject: Re: CVE request : client-side file creation via XSLT
 in Webkit


Nicolas,

After deeper investigation, this appears to be CVE-2011-1425, which was 
requested by you and assigned on March 14 (hopefully with email 
notification to you), and published through CVE on April 2 or 3 after an 
xmlsec announcement 
http://www.aleksey.com/pipermail/xmlsec/2011/009120.html

CVE-2011-1425 points to both changeset 79159 and Webkit bug 52688.

Are you talking about a different XSLT file-overwrite issue than 
CVE-2011-1425?

- Steve
