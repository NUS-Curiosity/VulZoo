Subject: CVE request -- libvirt: regression introduced in disk probe logic

Hello Steve, vendors.

Description:
Regression introduced in commit d6623003 (v0.8.8) - using the
wrong sizeof operand meant that security manager private data
was overlaying the allowDiskFOrmatProbing member of struct
_virSecurityManager.  This reopens disk probing, which was
supposed to be prevented by the solution to CVE-2010-2238.

Could you please allocate a CVE identifier for this issue?

Thank you,
