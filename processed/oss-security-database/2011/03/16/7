I probably should have been more clear here. I was under the impression the
CVE id applied to instances where it would use UPnP and no auth, which is
dangerous and should probably include a big warning with a button that says
"I know what I'm doing (but probably not really)".

UPnP by itself is not a security flaw.

Sorry for the confusion.
