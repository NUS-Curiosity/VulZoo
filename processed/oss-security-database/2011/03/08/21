I think this deserves an ID: CVE-2011-1095

The documentation clearly states that the output of this command will be
properly quoted. Even if we can't find a bad usage, there is quite likely a
shell script doing this in the universe.

I think the line between fix vs enhancement is crossed when we're talking
about documented behavior.

Thanks.
