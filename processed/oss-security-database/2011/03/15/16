The above bugs talk about two flaws. Based on discussions I'm giving them
both CVE ids.

Issue #1

Vino incorrectly tells users their desktop is only reachable over the local
network.

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=596190
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vino/+bug/344489

Use CVE-2011-1164

Issue #2

Vino can open ports via uPnP without alerting the user.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=678846

Use CVE-2011-1165

Thanks.
