Subject: RE: CVE Request: HP System Management Homepage(SMH)
 | Open URL Redirection

Hi,

SMH is not FOSS. The CVE assigned to this issue is CVE-2010-1586, and the
security bulletin is at
http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c0251
8794 which was published a while back  

Something fell through the cracks and we did not notify the reporter.
Apologies to Aung Khant.

Thanks,
Mark Menkhus
