Subject: CVE-2011-4313: BIND 9 Resolver crashes after logging an error in query.c

Hi,

This says it was posted today:

http://www.isc.org/software/bind/advisories/cve-2011-4313

"Versions affected:
All currently supported versions of BIND, 9.4-ESV, 9.6-ESV, 9.7.x, 9.8.x"

Does anyone readily know if BIND 9.3.x is affected as well?  It is not
"currently supported" upstream (per the table below), but is still found
in and supported by some distros.
