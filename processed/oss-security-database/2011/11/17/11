Our bind maintainer believes that 9.3.6 is affected (but possibly harder
to exploit or via a different vector).

However, he does not believe that 9.2.x and earlier are affected due to
the old DNSSEC implementation (so 9.2.x wouldn't understand current
DNSSEC signatures so would not cache them).

Some further details can be found in our bug:
