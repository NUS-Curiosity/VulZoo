I just re-read the ISC advisory, and it has this relevant detail:

"The patch has two components. When a client query is handled, the code
which processes the response to the client has to ask the cache for the
records for the name that is being queried. The first component of the
patch prevents the cache from returning the inconsistent data. The
second component prevents named from crashing if it detects that it has
been given an inconsistent answer of this nature."

However, I can't conclusively interpret this as the two components being
redundant or not.
