Subject: Re: CVE-2011-4313: BIND 9 Resolver crashes after logging an error in query.c

Speaking of BIND 9.3.x:

Red Hat has just released an update for 9.3.6 in RHEL5:

https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1458.html

bind-9.3.6-16.P1.el5_7.1.src.rpm

Meanwhile, per my further analysis, BIND 9.3.x's affected code in
query.c is only reached if the dnssec-enable option is set to yes,
regardless of whether the build of BIND includes full DNSSEC support
(is linked against OpenSSL) or not.

In 9.4.x+, it probably does not take "dnssec-enable yes" to make the
issue triggerable, because of the added query_addadditional2() function
with an extra instance of the assertion.  This extra function does not
have the same check for DNSSEC being enabled that query_addadditional()
does.  Here's query_addadditional()'s check in 9.3.x:

	if (!WANTDNSSEC(client) && dns_rdatatype_isdnssec(qtype))
		return (ISC_R_SUCCESS);

where WANTDNSSEC() is:

#define WANTDNSSEC(c)           (((c)->attributes & \
                                  NS_CLIENTATTR_WANTDNSSEC) != 0)

where the NS_CLIENTATTR_WANTDNSSEC flag is set when:

	if (!client->view->enablednssec) {
		message->flags &= ~DNS_MESSAGEFLAG_CD;
		client->extflags &= ~DNS_MESSAGEEXTFLAG_DO;
	}
[...]
	if ((client->extflags & DNS_MESSAGEEXTFLAG_DO) != 0)
		client->attributes |= NS_CLIENTATTR_WANTDNSSEC;

where server.c sets:

	result = ns_config_get(maps, "dnssec-enable", &obj);
	INSIST(result == ISC_R_SUCCESS);
	view->enablednssec = cfg_obj_asboolean(obj);

I hope I am not misreading this.
