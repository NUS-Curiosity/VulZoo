Hi Kurt / Dan,

Nick Kralevich here from the Android security team.

Google is a CNA (CVE Numbering Authority), and we've already assigned
this vulnerability CVE-2011-3874. To avoid confusion, I would
appreciate it if CVE-2011-3874 would be considered the authoritative
CVE for this vulnerability, and CVE-2011-4123 should be marked as a
duplicate. More information on the vold vulnerability, including a
patch, can be found at
http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=21681

For the record, Google maintains several security contact mailing
lists.  In general, you can reach Google security by e-mailing
security@...gle.com or visiting
http://www.google.com/about/corporate/company/security.html

For Android specific security issues, the preferred e-mail address is
security@...roid.com, or you can visit
http://developer.android.com/resources/faq/security.html#issue

For Chrome specific security issues, the preferred e-mail address is
security@...omium.org, or you can visit
http://dev.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/reporting-security-bugs

In general, e-mailing security@...gle.com will eventually get to
Chrome or Android, although it's faster to contact the product
specific security alias first.

Because Google is a CNA, we maintain our own pool of CVEs from Mitre.
Any of the addresses above can issue CVEs for Google related
vulnerabilities.

Thanks!
