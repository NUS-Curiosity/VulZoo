In general, an attacker-triggered crash in any type of product that acts 
as an "intermediary" between two parties - such as a proxy, firewall, mail 
server, anti-virus, etc. - is typically counted as a vulnerability for 
CVE, since the crash of the intermediary may cause many active sessions to 
be lost, not just the session for the attacker.  Add repeated crashes and 
you can have a substantive DoS on your hands.

For "passive" intermediaries like IDS and sniffers that just monitor 
traffic, a crash/DoS can lead to loss of visibility/awareness (passing 
traffic doesn't get captured), which can allow an attacker to hide 
activities.
