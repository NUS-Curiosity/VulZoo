> CVE-2011-2708 and CVE-2011-2710 are both about 20110701 XSS vulnerability: http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/357-20110701-xss-vulnerability.html and I have already contacted MITRE twice to get another one marked as obsolete.

Ok CVE-2011-2710 is public in CVE and NVD:
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2710, and
CVE-2011-2708 is still marked as reserved so we should probably quietly
take CVE-2011-2708 out back and shoot it.

CC'ing mitre.
