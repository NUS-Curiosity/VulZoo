Subject: Typo in description of CVE-2011-2708 and CVE-2011-4331? [was: Re:
 Fwd: XSS vulnerability in Joomla 1.6.3 - CVE-2011-2710 / CVE-2011-2708
 issue]

Hello Steve,

   thank you for the clarification due this.

But according to latest CVE-2011-2708 and CVE-2011-4331 description 
assignment, there seems to be a type (rounded / cycled definition of both):

======================================================
Name: CVE-2011-2708
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2708 [Open URL]
Final-Decision:
Interim-Decision:
Modified:
Proposed:
Assigned: 20110711
Category:

** REJECT **

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: CVE-2011-2708. Reason:
This candidate is a duplicate of CVE-2011-2708. Notes: All CVE users
should reference CVE-2011-2708 instead of this candidate. All
references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to
prevent accidental usage.

This one should mention 'CVE-2011-2710' in the body (based on the
reply below).

======================================================
Name: CVE-2011-4331
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-4331 [Open URL]

DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: CVE-2011-4331. Reason:
This candidate is a duplicate of CVE-2011-4331. Notes: All CVE users
should reference CVE-2011-4331 instead of this candidate. All
references and descriptions in this candidate have been removed to
prevent accidental usage.

This one should use "CVE-2011-4110" in the body, based on:
http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/378

Could you correct these two yet? (not a big deal, just wanted to
point this out those two to be described correctly, even when being
duplicates).

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
