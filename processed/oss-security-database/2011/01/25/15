Subject: CVE-2010-4238 xen dom0 issue

A missing sanity check was found in vbd_create() in the Xen hypervisor
implementation. As CD-ROM drives are not supported by the blkback 
back-end driver, attempting to use a virtual CD-ROM drive with blkback 
could trigger a denial of service (crash) on the host system running the 
Xen hypervisor.

This affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 only. There's no upstream patch.
