Subject: Re: possible flaw in widely used strtod.c implementation


Since this problem stems from a single codebase, strtod.c, so it gets a 
single CVE identifier (already assigned CVE-2010-4645).  The CVE 
description will "blame" strtod.c and mention PHP, and any other 
high-profile software that is discovered to use the same vulnerable, 
shared code.
