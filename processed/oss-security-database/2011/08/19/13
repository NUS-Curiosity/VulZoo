----- Original Message -----
> 1. OVERVIEW
> 
> WebsiteBaker 2.8.1 and lower versions are vulnerable to Cross Site
> Request Forgery (CSRF).
> 
> 
> 2. BACKGROUND
> 
> WebsiteBaker is a PHP-based Content Management System (CMS) designed
> with one goal in mind: to enable its users to produce websites with
> ease.
> 
> 
> 3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
> 
> WebsiteBaker 2.8.1 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a
> remote Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack. The flaw
> exists because the application does not require multiple steps or
> explicit confirmation for sensitive transactions for majority of
> administrator functions such as adding new user. By using a crafted
> URL, an attacker may trick the victim into visiting to his web page to
> take advantage of the trust relationship between the authenticated
> victim and the application. Such an attack could trick the victim into
> executing arbitrary commands in the context of their session with the
> application, without further prompting or verification.
