Subject: CVE assignment Apache httpd multiple-range DoS ("Apache Killer") -
 CVE-2011-3192

This thread is on the full-disclosure mailing list:
http://marc.info/?t=131379269200002&r=1&w=2
leading to this upstream discussion:
http://marc.info/?t=131409787700005&r=1&w=2

It is an escalation of server memory usage, and a plausible candidate 
for a CVE, so I've assigned CVE-2011-3192.

Thanks, Mark
