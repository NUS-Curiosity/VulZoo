Here are the ISC advisories:

http://www.isc.org/software/bind/advisories/cve-2011-2464
http://www.isc.org/software/bind/advisories/cve-2011-2465

The oldest affected version is 9.6'ish, and the advisories explicitly
say that "Other versions of BIND 9 not listed in this advisory are not
vulnerable to this problem."  So those of us with older BIND 9 appear to
have nothing to do on this. ;-)  (Of course, we might have other/older
issues to patch.)
