I'm not going to assign anything to the "enhancements" unless someone wants
me to. They don't sound like security flaws.

There is more information on these here:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0.5


# Fix XSS bug: Properly encode title used in Quick/Bulk Edit, and offer
  additional sanitization to various fields. Affects users of the Author or
  Contributor role. (r17397, r17406, r17412)
# Fix XSS bug: Preserve tag escaping in the tags meta box. Affects users of
  the Author or Contributor role. (r17401)

Use CVE-2011-0700 for the XSS flaws.


# Fix potential information disclosure of posts through the media uploader.
  Affects users of the Author role. (r17393)

Use CVE-2011-0701 for the information disclosure.

Thanks.
