Subject: CVE Request -- rt3 -- two issues: 1) Improper management of form
 data resubmittion upon user log out 2) SQL queries information leak by user
 account transition

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   RT3 upstream has released latest v3.8.9 version:
   [1] http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/rt-announce/2011-February/000186.html

   addressing three security flaws:
   1) * Move to a SHA-256 based password hashing scheme
      This has already got CVE id of CVE-2011-0009:
      http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0009

   2) * Redirect users to their desired pages after login.
      This prevents possible back button attacks after a user logs out.

      Further issue details:
      A security flaw was found in the way the RT3 ticketing
      system handled resubmitting of form data after the user
      has logged out of the browser (but not closed it).
      A local attacker could use this flaw to access the user
      account of the victim (login without providing a password
      or obtain user credentials).

      Upstream bug report:
      [c] http://issues.bestpractical.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=15804

      Upstream changeset:
      [d] https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/commit/917c211820590950f7eb0521f7f43b31aeed44c4

      Thomas, could you please confirm [d] is the proper fix for 2) issue? Thank you.
      (* Redirect users to their desired pages after login.)

   3) * Clone Scrip's TicketObj since we change the CurrentUser and it can leak
      information (Custom field values, etc)

      Further issue details:
      A security flaw was found in the way the RT3 ticketing
      system handled logging of SQL queries during performing
      of user account transition. A remote, authenticated RT3
      user could use this flaw to obtain sensitive information.

      [ii] http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/rt-announce/2011-February/000186.html

      Upstream changeset (needs confirmation from upstream if it's
      real fix for the issue yet):
      [iii] https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/commit/56e20b874e8d67ab93aa80c2c00155110a27e764

      Shawn, could you please confirm [iii] is the proper fix for 3) issue?
      (* Clone Scrip's TicketObj since we change the CurrentUser and it can leak)

      If [iii] not being the correct one for 3) issue, could you point us
      to the right one? Thank you.


Steve, once patches confirmed, could you allocate CVE ids for the 2), and 3) issues?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
