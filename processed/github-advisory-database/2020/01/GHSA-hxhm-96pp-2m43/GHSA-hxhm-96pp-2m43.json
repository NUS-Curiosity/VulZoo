  "summary": "Remote Code Execution in Angular Expressions",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe vulnerability, reported by GoSecure Inc, allows Remote Code Execution, if you call `expressions.compile(userControlledInput)` where `userControlledInput` is text that comes from user input.\n\n* If running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run any browser script when the application code calls expressions.compile(userControlledInput).\n* If running angular-expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to version 1.0.1 of angular-expressions\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA temporary workaround might be either to : \n\n* disable user-controlled input that will be fed into angular-expressions in your application\n\nOR\n\n* allow only following characters in the userControlledInput : \n\n```js\nif (/^[|a-zA-Z.0-9 :\"'+-?]+$/.test(userControlledInput)) {\n      var result = expressions.compile(userControlledInput);\n}\nelse {\n     result = undefined;\n}\n```\n\n### References\n\n[Removal of angular-expression sandbox](http://blog.angularjs.org/2016/09/angular-16-expression-sandbox-removal.html)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [angular-expressions](https://github.com/peerigon/angular-expressions/issues)\n* [Email us](mailto:contact@javascript-ninja.fr)\n\n### Credits \n\nThe issue was reported by Maxime Nadeau from GoSecure, Inc.",
