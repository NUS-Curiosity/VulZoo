  "summary": "Reset Password / Login vulnerability in Sulu",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThis vulnerability consists of a few related issues:\n\n#### Forget password leaks information if the user exists\n\nWhen the \"Forget password\" feature on the login screen is used, Sulu asks the user for a username or email address. If the given string is not found, a response with a `400` error code is returned, along with a error message saying that this user name does not exist:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"code\": 0,\n    \"message\": \"Entity with the type \\u0022Sulu\\\\Bundle\\\\SecurityBundle\\\\Entity\\\\User\\u0022 and the id \\u0022asdf\\u0022 not found.\"\n}\n```\n\nThis enables attackers to retrieve valid usernames.\n\n#### Forgot password leaks user email if user exists\n\nThe response of the \"Forgot Password\" request returns the email address to which the email was sent, if the operation was successful:\n\n```json\n{\"email\":\"admin@localhost.local\"}\n```\n\nThis information should not be exposed, as it can be used to gather email addresses.\n\n#### Response time of login gives hint if the username exists\n\nIf the username the user enters in the login screen does not exists, the request responds much faster than if the username exists. This again allows attackers to retrieve valid usernames.\n\n#### Reset Token for Forgot Password feature is not hashed\n\nThe reset token in the user database table is not hashed. That means that somebody could try to request a new password using the Forgot Password feature, and look that up in the database, if the attacker somehow got access to the database. Hashing the reset token would fix that problem.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem was fixed in Release 1.6.34, 2.0.10 and 2.1.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOverride the files manually in your project and change them accordingly.",
