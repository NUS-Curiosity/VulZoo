  "summary": "methodOverride Middleware Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in connect",
  "details": "Connect is a stack of middleware that is executed in order in each request.\n\nThe \"methodOverride\" middleware allows the http post to override the method of the request with the value of the \"_method\" post key or with the header \"x-http-method-override\".\n\nBecause the user post input was not checked, req.method could contain any kind of value. Because the req.method did not match any common method VERB, connect answered with a 404 page containing the \"Cannot `[method]` `[url]`\" content. The method was not properly encoded for output in the browser.\n\n\n###Example:\n```\n~ curl \"localhost:3000\" -d \"_method=<script src=http://nodesecurity.io/xss.js></script>\"\nCannot <SCRIPT SRC=HTTP://NODESECURITY.IO/XSS.JS></SCRIPT> /\n```\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to the newest version of Connect or disable methodOverride. It is not possible to avoid the vulnerability if you have enabled this middleware in the top of your stack.",
