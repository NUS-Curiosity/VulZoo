  "details": "### Impact\nA RCE exploit has been discovered in the Trivia module: this exploit allows Discord users with specifically crafted usernames to inject code into the Trivia module's leaderboard command. By abusing this exploit, it's possible to perform destructive actions and/or access sensitive information.\n\n### Patches\nThis critical exploit has been fixed on version 3.3.11.\n\n### Workarounds\nUnloading the Trivia module with ``unload trivia`` can render this exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to 3.3.11 to completely patch this issue.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/pull/4175\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)\n* Over on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/red)",
