  "summary": "XML External Entity in Dashboard Widget",
  "details": "### Problem\nIt has been discovered that RSS widgets are susceptible to XML external entity processing.\nThis vulnerability is reasonable, but is theoretical - it was not possible to actually reproduce the vulnerability with current PHP versions of supported and maintained system distributions.\n\nAt least with _libxml2_ version 2.9, the processing of XML external entities is disabled per default - and cannot be exploited. Besides that, a valid backend user account is needed.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 version 10.4.10 that fixes the problem described.",
