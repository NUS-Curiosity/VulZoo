  "details": "### Impact\n* Client implementations using this library\n\n### Issues\n1) The IdToken signature algorithm was not checked automatically, but only if the expected algorithm was passed in as a kwarg.\n2) JWA `none` algorithm was allowed in all flows.\n3) `oic.consumer.Consumer.parse_authz` returns an unverified IdToken. The verification of the token was left to the discretion of the implementator.\n4) `iat` claim was not checked for sanity (i.e. it could be in the future)\n\n### Patches\n1) IdToken signature is now always checked.\n2) JWA `none` algorithm is now allowed only if using the `response_type` `code`\n3) IdToken verification is now done automatically.\n4) `iat` claim is now checked for sanity.",
