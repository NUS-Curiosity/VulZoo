  "summary": "Information disclosure in SSB-DB",
  "details": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nServers running SSB-DB 20.0.0 (which is packaged with SSB-Server 16.0.0) must upgrade immediately.\n\n**There is no evidence that other SSB apps are vulnerable or that this problem has been exploited in the wild.**\n\nThe `get()` method is supposed to only decrypt messages when you explicitly ask it to, but there's a bug where it's decrypting any message that it can. This means that it's returning the decrypted content of private messages, which a malicious peer could use to get access to private data. This only affects peers running SSB-DB@20.0.0 who also have private messages, and is only known to be exploitable if you're also running SSB-OOO (default in SSB-Server), which exposes a thin wrapper around `get()` to anonymous peers.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nYes, please upgrade to SSB-DB 20.0.1 (or SSB-Server 16.0.1) immediately.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nYou may be able to disable the most obvious attack vector, SSB-OOO, by disabling the plugin, but you should upgrade immediately anyway.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, open an issue in [SSB-DB](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/)",
