  "summary": "CSRF issue on preview pages in Bolt CMS",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nBolt CMS lacked CSRF protection in the preview generating endpoint. Previews are intended to be generated by the admins, developers, chief-editors, and editors, who are authorized to create content in the application. But due to lack of proper CSRF protection, unauthorized users could generate a preview.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed in Bolt 3.7.1\n\n### References\n\nRelated issue: https://github.com/bolt/bolt/pull/7853",
