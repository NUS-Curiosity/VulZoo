  "summary": "Insufficient output escaping of attachment names in PHPMailer",
  "details": "### Impact\nCWE-116: Incorrect output escaping.\n\nAn attachment added like this (note the double quote within the attachment name, which is entirely valid):\n\n    $mail->addAttachment('/tmp/attachment.tmp', 'filename.html\";.jpg');\n\nWill result in a message containing these headers:\n\n    Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name=\"filename.html\";.jpg\"\n    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"filename.html\";.jpg\"\n\nThe attachment will be named `filename.html`, and the trailing `\";.jpg\"` will be ignored. Mail filters that reject `.html` attachments but permit `.jpg` attachments may be fooled by this.\n\nNote that the MIME type itself is obtained automatically from the *source filename* (in this case `attachment.tmp`, which maps to a generic `application/octet-stream` type), and not the *name* given to the attachment (though these are the same if a separate name is not provided), though it can be set explicitly in other parameters to attachment methods.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in PHPMailer 6.1.6 by escaping double quotes within the name using a backslash, as per RFC822 section 3.4.1, resulting in correctly escaped headers like this:\n\n    Content-Type: application/octet-stream; name=\"filename.html\\\";.jpg\"\n    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"filename.html\\\";.jpg\"\n\n### Workarounds\nReject or filter names and filenames containing double quote (`\"`) characters before passing them to attachment functions such as `addAttachment()`.\n\n### References\n[CVE-2020-13625](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-13625).\n[PHPMailer 6.1.6 release](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/releases/tag/v6.1.6)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the PHPMailer repo](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/issues)",
