  ],
  "summary": "Environment Variable Injection in GitHub Actions",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe `@actions/core` npm module `addPath` and `exportVariable` functions communicate with the Actions Runner over stdout by generating a string in a specific format. Workflows that log untrusted data to stdout may invoke these commands, resulting in the path or environment variables being modified without the intention of the workflow or action author. \n\n### Patches\nThe runner will release an update that disables the `set-env` and `add-path` workflow commands in the near future. For now, users should upgrade to `@actions/core v1.2.6` or later, and replace any instance of the `set-env` or `add-path` commands in their workflows with the new [Environment File Syntax](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/docs/commands.md#environment-files). Workflows and actions using the old commands or older versions of the toolkit will start to warn, then error out during workflow execution.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone, it is strongly suggested that you upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Actions Toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues)",
