  "summary": "Possible timing attack in derivation_endpoint",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin, it's possible for the attacker to use a timing attack to guess the signature of the derivation URL.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed by comparing sent and calculated signature in constant time, using `Rack::Utils.secure_compare`. Users using the `derivation_endpoint` plugin are urged to upgrade to Shrine 3.3.0 or greater.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers of older Shrine versions can apply the following monkey-patch after loading the `derivation_endpoint` plugin:\n\n```rb\nclass Shrine\n  class UrlSigner\n    def verify_signature(string, signature)\n      if signature.nil?\n        fail InvalidSignature, \"missing \\\"signature\\\" param\"\n      elsif !Rack::Utils.secure_compare(signature, generate_signature(string))\n        fail InvalidSignature, \"provided signature does not match the calculated signature\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### References\n\nYou can read more about timing attacks [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack).",
