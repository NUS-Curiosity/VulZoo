This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long strings.\n\n### Patches\nPlease update `uap-ruby` to &gt;= v2.6.0\n\n### For more information\nhttps://github.com/ua-parser/uap-core/security/advisories/GHSA-cmcx-xhr8-3w9p\n\nReported in `uap-core` by Ben Caller @bcaller",
