  "summary": "Local file disclosure in PHPMailer",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer&#39;s `msgHTML` method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base directory is provided, it resolves to `/`, meaning that relative image URLs get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.\n\n### Impact\nArbitrary local files can be attached to email messages.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in 5.2.22\n\n### Workarounds\nValidate input before using user-supplied file paths.\n\n### References\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5223\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open a private issue in [the PHPMailer project](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer)",
