  "summary": "Command injection in codecov (npm package)",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe `upload` method has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the `codecov-node` library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability.\n\nA similar CVE was issued: [CVE-2020-7597](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh), but the fix was incomplete. It only blocked `&`, and command injection is still possible using backticks instead to bypass the sanitizer.\n\nWe have written a [CodeQL](https://codeql.com) query, which automatically detects this vulnerability. You can see the results of the query on the `codecov-node` project [here](https://lgtm.com/query/7714424068617023832/).\n\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in version 3.7.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone, however, the attack surface is low in this case. Particularly in the standard use of codecov, where the module is used directly in a build pipeline, not built against as a library in another application that may supply malicious input and perform command injection. \n\n### References\n*  [CVE-2020-7597](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Contact us via our [Security Email](mailto:security@codecov.io)",
