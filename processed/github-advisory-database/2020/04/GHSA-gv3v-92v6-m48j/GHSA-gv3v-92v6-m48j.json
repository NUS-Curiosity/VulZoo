  "summary": "Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers in Jooby ('HTTP Response Splitting)",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n - Cross Site Scripting\n - Cache Poisoning\n - Page Hijacking\n\n### Patches\n\nThis was fixed in version `2.2.1`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are unable to update, ensure that user supplied data isn't able to flow to HTTP headers. If it does, pre-sanitize for CRLF characters.\n\n### References\n\n##### [CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/113.html)\n\nI've been poking at libraries to see if they are vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting and Jooby is my third case of finding this vulnerability.\n\n### Root Cause\n\nThis roots cause back to this line in the Jooby codebase:\n\nhttps://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/blob/93cfc80aa20c188f71a442ea7a1827da380e1c27/modules/jooby-netty/src/main/java/io/jooby/internal/netty/NettyContext.java#L102\n\nThe `DefaultHttpHeaders` takes a parameter `validate` which, when `true` (as it is for the no-arg constructor) validates that the header isn't being abused to do HTTP Response Splitting.\n\n### Reported By\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by @JLLeitschuh ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/JLLeitschuh))\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [jooby-project/jooby](https://github.com/jooby-project/jooby/issues)",
