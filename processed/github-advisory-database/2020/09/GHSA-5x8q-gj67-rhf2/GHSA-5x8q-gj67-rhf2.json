This allows attackers to make purchases on behalf of users if they have credit cards linked to their Discord accounts.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nRemove the package from your environment. Review your Discord account access and rotate tokens if possible. If a credit card was linked to a compromised account contact your credit card company.",
