  "summary": "Global node_modules Binary Overwrite in bin-links",
  "details": "Versions of  `bin-links` prior to 1.1.6 are vulnerable to a Global node_modules Binary Overwrite. It fails to prevent globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package installs. For example, if a package was installed globally and created a `serve` binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a `serve` binary would overwrite the first binary. This behavior is still allowed in local installations.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.1.6 or later.",
