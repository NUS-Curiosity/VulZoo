  "details": "Versions of `node-wifi` prior to 2.0.12 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject commands through the `ssid` variable and possibly achieving Remote Code Execution on the system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
