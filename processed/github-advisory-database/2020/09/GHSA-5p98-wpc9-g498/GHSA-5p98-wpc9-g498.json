A [Security](https://github.com/westy92/html-pdf-chrome#security) section has been added since v0.6.1 to detail proper usage of this library. Npm has revoked their advisory altogether.\n\n## Original Advisory\nAll versions of `html-pdf-chrome` are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The package executes HTTP requests if the parsed HTML contains external references to resources, such as `<iframe src=\"http://localhost\" height=\"800px\" width=\"800px\"></iframe>`. This allows attackers to access resources through HTTP that are accessible to the server, including private resources in the hosting environment.",
