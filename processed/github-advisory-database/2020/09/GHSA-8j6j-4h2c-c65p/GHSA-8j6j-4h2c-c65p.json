  "summary": "Arbitrary Code Execution in require-node",
  "details": "Versions of `require-node` prior to 1.3.4 for 1.x and 2.0.4 for 2.x are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The package fails to sanitize requests to the `require-node` endpoint, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code in the server through the injection of OS commands in the request body.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\n- If you are using 1.x, upgrade to version 1.3.4 or later.\n- If you are using 2.x, upgrade to version 2.0.4 or later.",
