  "details": "All versions of `cicada-render` contain malicious code. The package uploads system information to a remote server, downloads a file and executes it.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nAny computer that has this package installed or running should be considered fully compromised. All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer.\n\nThe package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.",
