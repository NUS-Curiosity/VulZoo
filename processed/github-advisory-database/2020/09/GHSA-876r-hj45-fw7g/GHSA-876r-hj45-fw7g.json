  "details": "All versions of `safer-eval` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading to Remote Code Execution. It is possible to escape the sandbox by forcing exceptions recursively in the evaluated code. This may allow attacker to execute arbitrary code in the system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe package is not suited to receive arbitrary user input. Consider using an alternative package.",
