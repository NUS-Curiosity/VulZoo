  "summary": "Command Injection in wxchangba",
  "details": "All versions of `wxchangba` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate user input on the `reqPostMaterial` function, passing contents of the `file` parameter to an exec call. This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative module until a fix is made available.",
