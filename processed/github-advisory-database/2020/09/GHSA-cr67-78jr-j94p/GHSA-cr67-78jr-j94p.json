  "summary": "Local File Inclusion in domokeeper",
  "details": "All versions of `domokeeper` are vulnerable to Local File Inclusion. The `/plugin/` route passes a GET parameter unsanitized to a `require()` call. It then returns the output of `require()` in the server response. This may allow attackers to load unintended code in the application. It also allows attackers to exfiltrate information in `.json` files.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
