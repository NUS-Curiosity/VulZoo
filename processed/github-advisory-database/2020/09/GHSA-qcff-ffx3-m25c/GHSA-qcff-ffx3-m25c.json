  "summary": "Command Injection in meta-git",
  "details": "All versions of `meta-git` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input and passes it directly to an `exec` call, which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system. The `clone` command is vulnerable through the branch name.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.",
