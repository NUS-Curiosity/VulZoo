  "summary": "Server-Side Request Forgery in @uppy/companion",
  "details": "Versions of `@uppy/companion` prior to 1.9.3 are vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The `get` route passes the user-controlled variable `req.body.url` to a GET request without sanitizing the value. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary URLs and make GET requests on behalf of the server. \n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.9.3 or later.",
