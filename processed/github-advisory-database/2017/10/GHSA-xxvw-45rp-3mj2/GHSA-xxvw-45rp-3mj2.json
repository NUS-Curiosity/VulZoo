  "summary": "Deserialization Code Execution in js-yaml",
  "details": "Versions 2.0.4 and earlier of `js-yaml` are affected by a code execution vulnerability in the YAML deserializer.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```\nconst yaml = require('js-yaml');\n\nconst x = `test: !!js/function >\nfunction f() { \nconsole.log(1); \n}();`\n\nyaml.load(x);\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate js-yaml to version 2.0.5 or later, and ensure that all instances where the `.load()` method is called are updated to use `.safeLoad()` instead.",
