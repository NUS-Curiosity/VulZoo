  "summary": "wallabag subject to Improper Authorization via annotations",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe annotations feature lets users add annotations on highlighted parts of an entry.\n\nThe controller does not validate authorization on `PUT` and `DELETE` requests which lets a logged user modify or delete any annotation using their ID on their endpoints `example.org/annotations/{id}`.\n\nThese vulnerable requests also disclose highlighted parts of the entry to the attacker.\n\nYou should immediately patch your instance to version 2.5.3 or higher if you have more than one user and/or having open registration.\n\n### Resolution\n\nA user check is now done in the vulnerable methods before applying change on an annotation.\n\nThe Annotation retrieval through a `ParamConverter` has also been replaced with a call to the `AnnotationRepository` in order to prevent any information disclosure through response discrepancy.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n\n\n### Credits\n\nWe would like to thank @bAuh0lz for reporting this issue through huntr.dev.\n\nReference: https://huntr.dev/bounties/8fdd9b31-d89b-4bbe-9557-20b960faf926/\n",
