  "summary": "Update share links to use FRP instead of SSH tunneling",
  "details": "### Impact\nThis is a vulnerability which affects anyone using Gradio's share links (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`) with Gradio versions older than 3.13.1. In these older versions of Gradio, a private SSH key is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are possible depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides. \n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched. Ideally, users should upgrade to `gradio==3.19.1` or later where the FRP solution has been properly tested. \n\n### Credit\nCredit to Greg Sadetsky and Samuel Tremblay-Cossette for alerting the team",
