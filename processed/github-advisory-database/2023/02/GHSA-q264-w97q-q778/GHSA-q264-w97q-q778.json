  "summary": "Denial of service via HAMT Decoding Panics",
  "details": "### Impact\nTrying to read malformed HAMT sharded directories can cause panics and virtual memory leaks.\nIf you are reading untrusted user input, an attacker can then trigger a panic.\n\nThis is caused by bogus `fanout` parameter in the HAMT directory nodes.\nThis include checks returned in [ipfs/go-bitfield GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r](https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/security/advisories/GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r), as well as limiting the `fanout` to `<= 1024` (to avoid attempts of arbitrary sized allocations).\n\n### Patches\n- https://github.com/ipfs/go-unixfs/commit/dbcc43ec3e2db0d01e8d80c55040bba3cf22cb4b\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not feed untrusted user data to the decoding functions.\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/ipfs/go-bitfield/security/advisories/GHSA-2h6c-j3gf-xp9r\n",
