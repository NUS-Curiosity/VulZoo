  "summary": "matrix-js-sdk Prototype Pollution vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\nEvents sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer.\n\n### Patches\nThis is fixed in matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nRedacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client can often fix it. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will often fix most perceived issues.\n\nIn some cases, no workarounds are possible.\n\n### References\nhttps://learn.snyk.io/lessons/prototype-pollution/javascript/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please email us at [security at matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).\n",
