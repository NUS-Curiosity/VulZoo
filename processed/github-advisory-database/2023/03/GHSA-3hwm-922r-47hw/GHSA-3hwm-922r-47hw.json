  "summary": "Stud42 vulnerable to denial of service",
  "details": "A security vulnerability has been identified in the GraphQL parser used by the API of s42.app. An attacker can overload the parser and cause the API pod to crash. With a bit of threading, the attacker can bring down the entire API, resulting in an unhealthy stream. This vulnerability can be exploited by sending a specially crafted request to the API with a large payload.\n\nAn attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack on the s42.app API, resulting in unavailability of the API for legitimate users.",
