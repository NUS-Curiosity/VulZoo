  "summary": "Directus vulnerable to extraction of password hashes through export querying",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUsers with read access to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2 password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined with a `_starts_with` filter. This allows the user to enumerate the password hashes.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnsuring that no user has `read` access to the `password` field in `directus_users` is sufficient to prevent this vulnerability. \n\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open a Discussion in [directus/directus](https://github.com/directus/directus/discussions/new)\n* Email us at [security@directus.io](mailto:security@directus.io)",
