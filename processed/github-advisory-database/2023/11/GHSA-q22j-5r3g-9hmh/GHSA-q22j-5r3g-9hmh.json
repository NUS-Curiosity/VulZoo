  "summary": "October CMS safe mode bypass using Page template injection",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAn authenticated backend user with the `editor.cms_pages`, `editor.cms_layouts`, or `editor.cms_partials` permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.safe_mode` being enabled can craft a special request to include PHP code in the CMS template.\n\nThis is not a problem for anyone who trusts their users with those permissions to usually write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.safe_mode` enabled. Still, it would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.safe_mode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write and execute arbitrary PHP.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in v3.4.15.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a workaround, remove the specified permissions from untrusted users.\n\n### References\n\nCredits to:\n- [Vasiliy Bodrov](https://github.com/whatev3n)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)",
