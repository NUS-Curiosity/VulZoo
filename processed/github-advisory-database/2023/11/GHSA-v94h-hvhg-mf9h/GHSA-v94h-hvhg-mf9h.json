  "summary": "Spring Framework vulnerable to denial of service",
  "details": "In Spring Framework versions 6.0.0 - 6.0.13, it is possible for a user to provide specially crafted HTTP requests that may cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.\n\nSpecifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:\n\n  *  the application uses Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux\n  *  io.micrometer:micrometer-core is on the classpath\n  *  an ObservationRegistry is configured in the application to record observations\n\n\nTypically, Spring Boot applications need the org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-actuator dependency to meet all conditions.",
