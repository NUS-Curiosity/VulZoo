  "summary": "Authenticated users can view job names and groups they do not have authorization to view",
  "details": "Access to two URLs used in both Rundeck Open Source and Process Automation products could allow authenticated users to access the URL path, which provides a list of job names and groups for any project, without the necessary authorization checks.\n\nThe affected URLs are:\n- `http[s]://[host]/context/rdJob/*` \n- `http[s]://[host]/context/api/*/incubator/jobs`\n\nThe output of these endpoints only exposes the name of job groups and the jobs contained within the specified project.  The output is read-only and the access does not allow changes to the information.\n\n### Impact\n\nRundeck, Process Automation version 4.17.0 up to 4.17.2\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions: 4.17.3\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAccess to two URLs used in either Rundeck Open Source or Process Automation products could be blocked at a load balancer level.\n- `http[s]://host/context/rdJob/*` \n- `http[s]://host/context/api/*/incubator/jobs`\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [our forums](https://community.pagerduty.com/forum/c/process-automation)\n* Enterprise Customers can open a [Support ticket](https://support.rundeck.com)\n\n",
