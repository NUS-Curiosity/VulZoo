  "summary": "Remote Code Execution due to Full Controled File Write in mlflow",
  "details": "The mlflow web server includes tools for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. As this vulnerability allows to write / overwrite any file on the file system, it gives a lot of ways to archive code execution (like overwriting `/home/<user>/.bashrc`). A malicious user could use this issue to get command execution on the vulnerable machine and get access to data & models information.",
