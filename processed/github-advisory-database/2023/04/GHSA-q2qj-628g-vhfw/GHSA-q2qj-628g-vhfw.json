  "summary": "Insecure header validation in slim/psr7",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAn attacker could sneak in a newline (`\\n`) into both the header names and values. While the specification states that `\\r\\n\\r\\n` is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept `\\n\\n`. An attacker that is able to control the header names that are passed to Slilm-Psr7 would be able to intentionally craft invalid messages, possibly causing application errors or invalid HTTP requests being sent out with an PSR-18 HTTP client. The latter might present a denial of service vector if a remote serviceâ€™s web application firewall bans the application due to the receipt of malformed requests.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is patched in 1.6.1, 1.5.1, and 1.4.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn Slim-Psr7 prior to 1.6.1, 1.5.1, and 1.4.1, validate HTTP header keys and/or values, and if using user-supplied values, filter them to strip off leading or trailing newline characters before calling withHeader().\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nWe are very grateful to and thank <a href=\"https://gjcampbell.co.uk/\">Graham Campbell</a> for reporting and working with us on this issue.\n\n### References\n\n* Guzzle: CVE-2023-29197, with advisory GHSA-wxmh-65f7-jcvw\n* Laminas Diactoros: CVE-2023-29530, with advisory GHSA-xv3h-4844-9h36\n* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.2.4",
