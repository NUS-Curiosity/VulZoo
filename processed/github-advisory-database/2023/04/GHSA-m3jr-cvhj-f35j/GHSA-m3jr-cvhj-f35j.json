  ],
  "summary": "org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml Cross-site Scripting vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe \"restricted\" mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki, introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1, only escaped `<script>` and `<style>`-tags but neither attributes that can be used to inject scripts nor other dangerous HTML tags like `<iframe>`. As a consequence, any code relying on this \"restricted\" mode for security is vulnerable to JavaScript injection (\"cross-site scripting\"/XSS). An example are anonymous comments in XWiki where the HTML macro filters HTML using restricted mode:\n\n```javascript\n{{html}}\n<a href='' onclick='alert(1)'>XSS</a>\n{{/html}}\n```\n\nWhen a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows server-side code execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the XWiki instance.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been patched in XWiki 14.6 RC1 with the introduction of a filter with allowed HTML elements and attributes that is enabled in restricted mode.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/b11eae9d82cb53f32962056b5faa73f3720c6182 - the patch with the filter\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/4a185e0594d90cd4916d60aa60bb4333dc5623b2 - the patch with the definitions what is allowed\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-9118 - the security issue with the HTML macro\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-1680 - the issue regarding a definition of what is allowed HTML\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2426 - the issue regarding the filter that fixes the security issue\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [XWiki Security mailing-list](mailto:security@xwiki.org)",
