  "summary": "Jenkins Convert To Pipeline Plugin vulnerable to command injection",
  "details": "Jenkins Convert To Pipeline Plugin 1.0 and earlier uses basic string concatenation to convert Freestyle projects' Build Environment, Build Steps, and Post-build Actions to the equivalent Pipeline step invocations.\n\nThis allows attackers able to configure Freestyle projects to prepare a crafted configuration that injects Pipeline script code into the (unsandboxed) Pipeline resulting from a conversion by Convert To Pipeline Plugin. If an administrator converts the Freestyle project to a Pipeline, the script will be pre-approved.",
