  "details": "### Summary\n\nKitchen-Terraform v7.0.0 introduced a regression which caused all Terraform output values, including sensitive values, to be printed at the `info` logging level during the `kitchen converge` action. Prior to v7.0.0, the output values were printed at the `debug` level to avoid writing sensitive values to the terminal by default.\n\n### Original Report\n\n@brettcurtis:\n> Hopefully, I'm not doing something stupid here, but I'm seeing sensitive outputs printed in the kitchen output. You can check this action for an example: https://github.com/osinfra-io/terraform-google-project/actions/runs/4700065515/jobs/8334277309#step:5:215\n>\n> It's not really a sensitive value just used it as an example.",
