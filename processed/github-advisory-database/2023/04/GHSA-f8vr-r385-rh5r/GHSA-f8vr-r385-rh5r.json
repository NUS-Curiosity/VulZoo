  "summary": "h2 vulnerable to denial of service",
  "details": "Hyper is an HTTP library for Rust and h2 is an HTTP 2.0 client & server implementation for Rust. An issue was discovered in h2 v0.2.4 when processing header frames. It incorrectly processes the HTTP2 `RST_STREAM` frames by not always releasing the memory immediately upon receiving the reset frame, leading to stream stacking. As a result, the memory and CPU usage are high which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThis issue affects users only when dealing with http2 connections.",
