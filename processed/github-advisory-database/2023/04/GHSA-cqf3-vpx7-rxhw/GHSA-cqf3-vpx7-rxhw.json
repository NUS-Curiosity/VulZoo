  "summary": "Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) in Pay",
  "details": "### Impact\nA payments info page of Pay is susceptible to reflected Cross-site scripting. An attacker could create a working URL that renders a javascript link to a user on a Rails application that integrates Pay. This URL could be distributed via email to specifically target certain individuals. If the targeted application contains a functionality to submit user-generated content (such as comments) the attacker could even distribute the URL using that functionality.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in version 6.3.2 and above.\n\nPay will now sanitize the `back` parameter and only permit relative paths.\n",
