  "details": "Jenkins mabl Plugin 0.0.46 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nmabl Plugin 0.0.47 requires POST requests and the appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.",
