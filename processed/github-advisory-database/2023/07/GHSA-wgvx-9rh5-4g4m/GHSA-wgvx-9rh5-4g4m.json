  "details": "Jenkins Benchmark Evaluator Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL and to check for the existence of directories, `.csv`, and `.ycsb` files on the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.",
