  "summary": "snyk Code Injection vulnerability",
  "details": "The package snyk before 1.1064.0 is vulnerable to Code Injection when analyzing a project. An attacker who can convince a user to scan a malicious project can include commands in a build file such as build.gradle or gradle-wrapper.jar, which will be executed with the privileges of the application. This vulnerability may be triggered when running the the CLI tool directly, or when running a scan with one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI. Successful exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social engineering - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a Trust feature then the target folder must be marked as ‘trusted’ in order to be vulnerable.\n\n**NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in [CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342), and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as well.\n\nThe affected IDE plugins and versions are: \n- VS Code - Affected: <=1.8.0, Fixed: 1.9.0 \n- IntelliJ - Affected: <=2.4.47, Fixed: 2.4.48 \n- Visual Studio - Affected: <=1.1.30, Fixed: 1.1.31 \n- Eclipse - Affected: <=v20221115.132308, Fixed: All subsequent versions \n- Language Server - Affected: <=v20221109.114426, Fixed: All subsequent versions",
