  "summary": "Possible image tampering from missing image validation for Packages",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nCrossplanes image backend does not validate the byte contents of Crossplane packages. As such, Crossplane does not detect if an attacker has tampered with a Package.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in 1.11.5, 1.12.3 and 1.13.0, all the supported versions of Crossplane at the time of writing.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOnly using images from trusted sources and keeping Package editing/creating privileges to administrators only, which should be both considered already best practices.\n\n### References\n\nSee `ADA-XP-23-11` in the Security Audit's [report](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/ac8b24fe739c5d942ea885157148497f196c3dd3/security/ADA-security-audit-23.pdf).\n\n### Credits\n\nThis was reported as `ADA-XP-23-11` by @AdamKorcz and @DavidKorczynski from Ada Logic and facilitated by OSTIF as part of the Security Audit sponsored by CNCF.",
