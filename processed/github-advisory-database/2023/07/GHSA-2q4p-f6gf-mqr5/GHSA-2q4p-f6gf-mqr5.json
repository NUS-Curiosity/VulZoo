  "summary": "Graylog server has partial path traversal vulnerability in Support Bundle feature",
  "details": "A partial path traversal vulnerability exists in Graylog's [Support Bundle](https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-1/making_sense_of_your_log_data/cluster_support_bundle.htm) feature. The vulnerability is caused by incorrect user input validation in an HTTP API resource.\n\nThanks to weiweiwei9811 for reporting this vulnerability and providing detailed information.\n\n### Impact\n\nGraylog's Support Bundle feature allows an attacker with valid Admin role credentials to download or delete files in sibling directories of the support bundle directory.\n\nThe default `data_dir` in operating system packages (DEB, RPM) is set to `/var/lib/graylog-server`. The data directory for the Support Bundle feature is always `<data_dir>/support-bundle`.\n\nDue to the partial path traversal vulnerability, an attacker with valid Admin role credentials can read or delete files in directories that start with a `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundle` directory name.\n\nThe vulnerability would allow the download or deletion of files in the following example directories.\n\n- `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundle-test`\n- `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundlesdirectory`\n\nFor the [Graylog](https://hub.docker.com/r/graylog/graylog) and [Graylog Enterprise](https://hub.docker.com/r/graylog/graylog-enterprise) Docker images, the `data_dir` is set to `/usr/share/graylog/data` by default.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability is fixed in Graylog version 5.1.3 and later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n\nBlock all HTTP requests to the following HTTP API endpoints by using a reverse proxy server in front of Graylog.\n\n- `GET /api/system/debug/support/bundle/download/{filename}`\n- `DELETE /api/system/debug/support/bundle/{filename}`\n",
