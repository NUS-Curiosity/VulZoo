  "summary": "cross-site inclusion (XSSI) of files in jupyter-server",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nImproper cross-site credential checks on `/files/` URLs could allow exposure of certain file contents, or accessing files when opening untrusted files via  \"Open image in new tab\".\n\n### Patches\n\nJupyter Server 2.7.2\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUse lower performance `--ContentsManager.files_handler_class=jupyter_server.files.handlers.FilesHandler`, which implements the correct checks.\n\n### References\n\nUpstream patch for CVE-2019-9644 was not applied completely, leaving part of the vulnerability open.\n\nVulnerability reported by Tim Coen via the [bug bounty program](https://app.intigriti.com/programs/jupyter/jupyter/detail) [sponsored by the European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/news/european-commissions-open-source-programme-office-starts-bug-bounties-2022-01-19_en) and hosted on the [Intigriti platform](https://www.intigriti.com/).",
