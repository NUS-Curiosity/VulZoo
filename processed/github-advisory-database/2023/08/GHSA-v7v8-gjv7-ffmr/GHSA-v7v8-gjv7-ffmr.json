  "summary": "@excalidraw/excalidraw Cross-site Scripting vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nXSS vulnerability due to improperly sanitizing URLs of links that can be attached on canvas elements. This affects users of the npm package `@excalidraw/excalidraw` provided it was deployed in environments where untrusted user input in drawings that are then shared with third parties is a concern. If you only hosted the editor in trusted environments, or sharing didn't take place, the impact is minimized.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatch is available on version 0.15.3 and up (stable), or latest `@excalidraw/excalidraw@next` (unstable releases).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround without upgrading unless deployed in environments without untrusted user input.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-EXCALIDRAWEXCALIDRAW-5841658\nhttps://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/6728",
