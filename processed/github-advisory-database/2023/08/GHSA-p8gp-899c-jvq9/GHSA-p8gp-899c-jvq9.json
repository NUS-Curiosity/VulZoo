  "summary": "Wallabag user can reset data unintentionally ",
  "details": "# Description\n\nwallabag was discovered to contain a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) which allows attackers to arbitrarily reset annotations, entries and tags, by the GET request to `/reset/annotations`, `/reset/entries`, `/reset/tags`, `/reset/archived`.\n\nThis vulnerability has a CVSSv3.1 score of 4.3.\n\n**You should immediately patch your instance to version 2.6.3 or higher if you have more than one user and/or having open registration**.\n\n# Resolution\n\nThese actions are now doable only via POST method, which ensures that we can't do them via a 3rd-party website. \n\n# Credits \n\nWe would like to thank @zpbrent for reporting this issue through huntr.dev.\n\nReference: https://huntr.dev/bounties/4ee0ef74-e4d4-46e7-a05c-076bce522299/",
