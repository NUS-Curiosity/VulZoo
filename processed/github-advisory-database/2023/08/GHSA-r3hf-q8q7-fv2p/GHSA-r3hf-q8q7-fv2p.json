  "summary": "Angular critical CSS inlining Cross-site Scripting Vulnerability Advisory",
  "details": "### Impact\nAngular Universal applications on 16.1.0 and 16.1.1 using critical CSS inlining are vulnerable to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) attack where an attacker can trick another user into visiting a page which injects malicious JavaScript.\n\nAngular CLI applications without Universal do perform critical CSS inlining as well, however exploiting this requires a malicious actor to already have access to modify source code directly.\n\n### Patches\n`@nguniversal/common` should be upgraded to 16.1.2 or higher. 16.2.0-rc.0 is safe.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe easiest solution is likely to upgrade Universal to 16.1.2 or downgrade to 16.0.x or lower. Alternatively you can [override](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides) specifically the `critters` dependency with version `0.0.20` in your `package.json`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"overrides\": {\n    \"critters\": \"0.0.20\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### References\n\n* [Angular Blog Post](https://blog.angular.io/notice-of-xss-issue-affecting-angular-universal-16-1-0-16-1-1-95dbae068f)",
