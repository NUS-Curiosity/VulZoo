  "summary": "Gradio makes the `/file` secure against file traversal and server-side request forgery attacks",
  "details": "Older versions of `gradio` contained a vulnerability in the `/file` route which made them susceptible to file traversal attacks in which an attacker could access arbitrary files on a machine running a Gradio app with a public URL (e.g. if the demo was created with `share=True`, or on Hugging Face Spaces) if they knew the path of files to look for. \n\nThis was not possible through regular URLs passed into a browser, but it was possible through the use of programmatic tools such as `curl` with the `--pass-as-is` flag. \n\nFurthermore,  the `/file` route in Gradio apps also contained a vulnerability that made it possible to use it for SSRF attacks.\n\nBoth of these vulnerabilities have been fixed in `gradio==4.11.0`",
