  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-cvg2-7c3j-g36j. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nA flaw was found in Keycloak that prevents certain schemes in redirects, but permits them if a wildcard is appended to the token. This issue could allow an attacker to submit a specially crafted request leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or further attacks. This flaw is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-10748.",
