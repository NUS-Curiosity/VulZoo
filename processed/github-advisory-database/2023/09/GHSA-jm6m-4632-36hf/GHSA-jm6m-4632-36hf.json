  "summary": "Composer Remote Code Execution vulnerability via web-accessible composer.phar",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUsers publishing a composer.phar to a public web-accessible server where the composer.phar can be executed as a php file may be impacted if PHP also has `register_argc_argv` enabled in php.ini.\n\n### Patches\n\n2.6.4, 2.2.22 and 1.10.27 patch this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nMake sure `register_argc_argv` is disabled in php.ini, and avoid publishing composer.phar to the web as this really should not happen.\n",
