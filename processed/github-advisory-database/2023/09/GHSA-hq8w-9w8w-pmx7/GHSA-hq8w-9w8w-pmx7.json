  ],
  "summary": "WireMock Controlled Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability through URL",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWireMock can be configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address rules and a list of denied address rules, where the allowed list is evaluated first. [Documentation](https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses). \n\nUntil WireMock Webhooks Extension [3.0.0-beta-15](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/releases/tag/3.0.0-beta-15), the filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for Webhooks, so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the `limitProxyTargets` settings. \n\nVia the WireMock webhooks configuration, POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary service reachable from WireMockâ€™s instance. For example, If someone is running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster, they can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even against secure ones by passing a token, discovered using another exploit, via authentication headers.\n\n### Affected  components\n\n- WireMock Webhooks Extension 2.x versions until 2.35.1 (security patch)\n- WireMock 3.x version until 3.0.3 (security patch)\n- All versions of WireMock Studio (discontinued). This distribution bundles the WireMock Webhooks Extension and activates it by default\n\n### Patches and Mitigation\n\n- For WireMock 2.x and 3.x - upgrade to the versions with the security patches\n- Setup network restrictions similarly to https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses \n- For WireMock Studio: Stop using discontinued WireMock Studio, migrate to other distributions. The vendor of WireMock Studio recommends migration to [WireMock Cloud](https://www.wiremock.io/product)\n\nNOTE: It was confirmed that [WireMock Cloud](https://www.wiremock.io/product) does not expose sensitive internal APIs and hence not vulnerable to the issue. No action is needed if you use this SaaS distribution.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Use external firewall rules to define the list of permitted destinations\n\n### References\n\n- CVE-2023-39967\n- [Preventing proxying to and recording from specific target addresses](https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses)\n\n### Credits\n\n- @W0rty for reporting CVE-2023-39967 in WireMock Studio\n- WireMock Inc. team for discovering similar exploits in Webhooks and the risk in the Proxy mode defaults for WireMock\n\n",
