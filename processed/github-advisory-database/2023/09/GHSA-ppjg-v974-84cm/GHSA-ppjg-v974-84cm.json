  "summary": "Go-Ethereum vulnerable to denial of service via malicious p2p message",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA vulnerable node, can be made to consume unbounded amounts of memory when handling specially crafted p2p messages sent from an attacker node.\n\n### Details\n\nThe p2p handler spawned a new goroutine to respond to `ping` requests. By flooding a node with ping requests, an unbounded number of goroutines can be created, leading to resource exhaustion and potentially crash due to OOM.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe fix is included in geth version `1.12.1-stable`, i.e, `1.12.2-unstable` and onwards. \n\nFixed by https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/27887\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo known workarounds. \n\n### Credits\n\nThis bug was reported by Patrick McHardy and reported via [bounty@ethereum.org](mailto:bounty@ethereum.org). \n\n### References\n\n",
