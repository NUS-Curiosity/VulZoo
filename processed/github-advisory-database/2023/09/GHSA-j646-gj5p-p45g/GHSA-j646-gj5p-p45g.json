  "details": "**Google is aware that an exploit for [CVE-2023-4863](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4863) exists in the wild.**\n\n### Description\n\nHeap buffer overflow in WebP in Google Chrome prior to 116.0.5845.187 allowed a remote attacker to perform an out of bounds memory write via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: Critical)\n\n### References\n\n- https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-4863\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863\n- https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/366551978/Browser-companies-patch-critical-zero-day-vulnerability\n\n---\n**Updated**\n\nThere is another related security vulnerability. \n\n> There's another related CVE ([CVE-2023-5217](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5217)) that is fixed in Chromium 117.0.5938.132. This one is triggered by WebCodecs API encoder usage, so a workaround for older versions is to disable the WebCodecs API (`--disable-blink-features=WebCodecs`).\n\nAs per https://magpcss.org/ceforum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=19551#p54150\n",
