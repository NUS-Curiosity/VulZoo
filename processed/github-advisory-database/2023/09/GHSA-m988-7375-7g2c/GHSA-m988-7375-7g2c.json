  "summary": "pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in Translations",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe translation value with text including “%s” (from “%suggest%) is parsed by sprintf() even though it’s supposed to be output literally to the user.\n\nThe translations may be accessible by a user with comparatively lower overall access (as the translation permission cannot be scoped to certain “modules”) and a skilled attacker might be able to exploit the parsing of the translation string in the dialog box.\n\n### Patches\nhttps://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/abd7739298f974319e3cac3fd4fcd7f995b63e4c.patch\n\n### Workarounds\nUpdate to version 1.1.2 or apply this patches manually\nhttps://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/abd7739298f974319e3cac3fd4fcd7f995b63e4c.patch\n",
