  "summary": "github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap vulnerable to DOS unbounded persistent memory leak",
  "details": "This package has been moved to [`github.com/ipfs/boxo/bitswap`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/boxo/bitswap), this vulnerability is tracked there: https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/security/advisories/GHSA-m974-xj4j-7qv5 (`CVE-2023-25568`)\n\n### Remediation\nThis is a two step process:\n1. Apply one of:\n   - (**recommended**) upgrade from `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap` to `github.com/ipfs/boxo/bitswap`.\n   - If you are still using `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap` and cannot upgrade to `boxo`, you can upgrade to `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap@v0.12.0`, this will replace the `go-bitswap` implementation by stubs which points to `boxo`.\n2. Open https://github.com/ipfs/boxo/security/advisories/GHSA-m974-xj4j-7qv5 and then follow `boxo`'s remediation section.\n\n### Vulnerable symbols\n- `>= v0.9.0; < v0.12.0`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/server/internal/decision.(*Engine).MessageReceived`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/server/internal/decision.(*Engine).NotifyNewBlocks`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/server/internal/decision.(*Engine).findOrCreate`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/server/internal/decision.(*Engine).PeerConnected`\n- `v0.8.0`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/internal/decision.(*Engine).MessageReceived`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/internal/decision.(*Engine).NotifyNewBlocks`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/internal/decision.(*Engine).findOrCreate`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/internal/decision.(*Engine).PeerConnected`\n- `< v0.8.0`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/internal/decision.(*Engine).MessageReceived`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/internal/decision.(*Engine).receiveBlocksFrom`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/internal/decision.(*Engine).findOrCreate`\n  - `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/internal/decision.(*Engine).PeerConnected`\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are using the stubs at `github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap` and not taking advantage of the features provided by the server, refactoring your code to use the new split API will allows you to run in a client-only mode using: [`github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/client`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-bitswap/client).",
