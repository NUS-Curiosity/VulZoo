  "summary": "Jenkins SAML Single Sign On(SSO) Plugin Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability",
  "details": "Jenkins SAML Single Sign On(SSO) Plugin 2.0.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML, or parse a local file on the Jenkins controller as XML.\n\nAs the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.\n\nAdditionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nSAML Single Sign On(SSO) Plugin 2.1.0 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoints.",
