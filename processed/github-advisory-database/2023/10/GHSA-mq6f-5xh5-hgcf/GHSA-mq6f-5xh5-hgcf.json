  "summary": "Harbor timing attack risk",
  "details": "In the Harbor jobservice container, the comparison of secrets in the authenticator type is prone to timing attacks. The vulnerability occurs due to the following code: https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/blob/aaea068cceb4063ab89313d9785f2b40f35b0d63/src/jobservice/api/authenticator.go#L69-L69\nTo avoid this issue, constant time comparison should be used.\n```\nsubtle.ConstantTimeCompare([]byte(expectedSecret), []byte(secret)) == 0\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis attack might be possible theoretically, but no workable proof of concept is available, and access complexity is set at High.\nThe jobservice exposes these APIs\n```\nCreate a job task --- POST /api/v1/jobs    \nGet job task information --- GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}\nStop job task ---  POST /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}\nGet job log task ---  GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/log\nGet job execution --- GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}/executions\nGet job stats ---  GET /api/v1/stats\nGet job service configuration ---  GET /api/v1/config\n```\nIt is used to create jobs/stop job tasks and retrieve job task information.  If an attacker obtains the secrets, it is possible to retrieve the job information, create a job, or stop a job task. \n\nThe following versions of Harbor are involved:\n<=Harbor 2.8.2, <=Harbor 2.7.2, <= Harbor 2.6.x, <=Harbor 1.10.17\n\n\n### Patches\nHarbor 2.8.3, Harbor 2.7.3, Harbor 1.10.18\n\n### Workarounds\nBecause the jobservice only exposes HTTP service to harbor-core containers, blocking any inbound traffic from the external network to the jobservice container can reduce the risk.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Porcupiney Hairs for reporting this issue.\n",
