  "summary": "Prototype Pollution in ali-security/mongoose",
  "details": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability causes a Prototype Pollution in document.js, through functions such as findByIdAndUpdate().\nFor applications using Express and EJS, this can potentially allow remote code execution.\n\n### Patches\nThe original patched version for mongoose 5.3.3 did not include a fix for CVE-2023-3696. Therefore the existing version @seal-security/mongoose-fixed version 5.3.3 is affected by this vulnerability (though it is protected from CVE-2022-2564 and CVE-2019-17426). To mitigate this issue, a @seal-security/mongoose-fixed version 5.3.4 has been deployed. Note that this version is compatible with the original mongoose version 5.3.3, not version 5.3.4\n\n### References\nhttps://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MONGOOSE-5777721\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9m93-w8w6-76hh\nhttps://github.com/Automattic/mongoose/commit/f1efabf350522257364aa5c2cb36e441cf08f1a2\n",
