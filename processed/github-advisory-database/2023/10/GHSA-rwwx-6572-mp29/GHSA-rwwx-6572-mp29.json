  "summary": "org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-attachment-api vulnerable to Missing Authorization on Attachment Move",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAn attacker with edit access on any document (can be the user profile which is editable by default) can move any attachment of any other document to this attacker-controlled document.
