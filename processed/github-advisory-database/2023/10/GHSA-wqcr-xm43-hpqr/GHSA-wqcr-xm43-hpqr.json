  "summary": "Vulnerable version of libwebp and can be exploited with a malicious source image",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability affects deployments of FreeImage that involve decoding or processing malicious source .webp files. If you only process your own trusted files, this should not affect you, but **you should remove FreeImage from your project, as it is not maintained and presents a massive security risk**. \n\nIf you are using FreeImage via  ImageResizer.Plugins.FreeImage, please utilize [Imageflow](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow) or [Imageflow.Server](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow-dotnet-server) instead, or upgrade to ImageResizer 5 and use ImageResizer.Plugins.Imageflow (enable Prereleases on NuGet to access). \n\nFreeImage relies on Google's [libwebp](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp) library to decode .webp images, and is affected by the recent zero-day out-of-bounds write vulnerability [CVE-2023-4863](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863) and https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr. The libwebp vulnerability also affects Chrome, Android, macOS, and other consumers of the library).\n\nlibwebp patched [the vulnerability](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/commit/2af26267cdfcb63a88e5c74a85927a12d6ca1d76 ) and released [1.3.2](https://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/releases/tag/v1.3.2). FreeImage hasn't been updated since then and is presumed vulnerable. \n\n### Patches\n\nNone. FreeImage has not been updated in several years.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n If you are using ImageResizer.Plugins.FreeImage, please utilize [Imageflow](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow) or [Imageflow.Server](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow-dotnet-server) instead, or upgrade to ImageResizer 5 and use ImageResizer.Plugins.Imageflow (enable Prereleases on NuGet to access). \n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j7hp-h8jx-5ppr\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4863\nhttps://github.com/webmproject/libwebp/commit/2af26267cdfcb63a88e5c74a85927a12d6ca1d76 \nhttps://github.com/NoXF/libwebp-sys/commits/master",
