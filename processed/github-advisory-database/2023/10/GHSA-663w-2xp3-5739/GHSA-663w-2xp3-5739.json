  "summary": "org.xwiki.rendering:xwiki-rendering-xml Improper Neutralization of Invalid Characters in Identifiers in Web Pages vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe cleaning of attributes during XHTML rendering, introduced in version 14.6-rc-1, allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid attribute names. This can be exploited, e.g., via the link syntax in any content that supports XWiki syntax like comments in XWiki: \n\n```\n[[Link1>>https://XWiki.example.com||/onmouseover=\"alert('XSS1')\"]]\n```\n\nWhen a user moves the mouse over this link, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. When this user is a privileged user who has programming rights, this allows server-side code execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the XWiki instance.\n\nWhile this attribute was correctly recognized as not allowed, the attribute was still printed with a prefix `data-xwiki-translated-attribute-` without further cleaning or validation.\n\nNote that while versions below 14.6 are not vulnerable to this particular vulnerability, they are still vulnerable to XSS through attributes in XWiki syntax, see [the corresponding advisory](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/security/advisories/GHSA-6gf5-c898-7rxp).\n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by removing characters not allowed in data attributes and then validating the cleaned attribute again.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.\n\n### References\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-697\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-rendering/commit/f4d5acac451dccaf276e69f0b49b72221eef5d2f\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [XWiki Security mailing-list](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n",
