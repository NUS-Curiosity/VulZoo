  "summary": "Apollo Router vulnerable to Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe Apollo Router is a configurable, high-performance graph router written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo Federation. Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate when a multi-part response is sent. When users send queries to the router that uses the `@defer` or Subscriptions, the Router will panic.\n \nTo be vulnerable, users of Router must have a coprocessor with `coprocessor.supergraph.response` configured in their `router.yaml` and also to support either `@defer` or Subscriptions.  \n\n### Patches\nRouter version 1.33.0 has a fix for this vulnerability. https://github.com/apollographql/router/pull/4014 fixes the issue.  \n\n### Workarounds\nFor affected versions, avoid using the coprocessor supergraph response:\n```yml\n# do not use this stage in your coprocessor configuration\ncoprocessor:\n  supergraph:\n    response:\n``` \n\nOr you can disable defer and subscriptions support:\n```yml\n# disable defer and subscriptions:\nsupergraph:\n  defer_support: false # enabled by default\nsubscription:\n  enabled: false # disabled by default\n```\nand continue to use the coprocessor supergraph response.\n### References\nhttps://github.com/apollographql/router/issues/4013\n",
