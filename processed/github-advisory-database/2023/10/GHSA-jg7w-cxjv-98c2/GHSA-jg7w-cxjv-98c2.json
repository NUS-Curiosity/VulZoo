  "summary": "SpiceDB leaks information in log files when URI cannot be parsed",
  "details": "SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired database for creating and managing security-critical application permissions. When the provided datastore URI is malformed (e.g. by having a password which contains `:`) the full URI (including the provided password) is printed, so that the password is shown in the logs. Version 1.27.0-rc1 patches this issue.\n\nExample output:\n```\nterminated with errors error=\"unable to create migration driver for postgres: parse \\\"postgres://spicedb:<PASSWORD IN PLAINTEXT>\": invalid port \\\"<PASSWORD IN PLAINTEXT>\\\" after host\"\n```",
