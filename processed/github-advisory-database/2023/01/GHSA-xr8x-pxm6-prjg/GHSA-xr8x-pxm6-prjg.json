  "details": "### Impact\nMITM can enable Zip-Slip.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\n#### Vulnerability 1: `Publisher.java`\n\nThere is no validation that the zip file being unpacked has entries that are not maliciously writing outside of the intended destination directory.\n\nhttps://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/blob/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/publisher/Publisher.java#L3598-L3610\n\n#### Vulnerability 2: `WebSourceProvider.java`\n\nThere is a check for malicious zip entries here, but it is not covered by test cases and could potentially be reverted in future changes.\n\nhttps://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/blob/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/web/WebSourceProvider.java#L104-L112\n\n#### Vulnerability 3: `ZipFetcher.java`\n\nThis retains the path for Zip files in FetchedFile entries, which could later be used to output malicious entries to another compressed file or file system.\n\nhttps://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/blob/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/publisher/ZipFetcher.java#L57-L106\n\n#### Vulnerability 4: `IGPack2NpmConvertor.java`\n\nThe loadZip method retains the path for entries in the zip file, which could later be used to output malicious entries to another compressed file or file system.\n\nhttps://github.com/HL7/fhir-ig-publisher/blob/87313e92de6dd6cea816449e0edd225e054a7891/org.hl7.fhir.publisher.core/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/igtools/publisher/IGPack2NpmConvertor.java#L442-L463\n\n",
