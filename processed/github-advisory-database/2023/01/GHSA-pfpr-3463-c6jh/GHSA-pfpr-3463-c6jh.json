  "summary": "ruby-git has potential remote code execution vulnerability",
  "details": "The git gem, between versions 1.2.0 and 1.12.0, incorrectly parsed the output of the `git ls-files` command using `eval()` to unescape quoted file names. If a file name was added to the git repository contained special characters, such as `\\n`, then the `git ls-files` command would print the file name in quotes and escape any special characters. If the `Git#ls_files` method encountered a quoted file name it would use `eval()` to unquote and unescape any special characters, leading to potential remote code execution. Version 1.13.0 of the git gem was released which correctly parses any quoted file names.\n",
