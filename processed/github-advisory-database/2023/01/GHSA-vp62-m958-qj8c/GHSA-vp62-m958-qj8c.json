  "details": "**This CVE addresses the partial fix for CVE-2019-25075**\n\nGravitee API Management before 3.15.13 allows path traversal through HTML injection. A certain HTML injection combined with path traversal in the Email service in Gravitee API Management before 3.15.13 allows anonymous users to read arbitrary files via a /management/users/register request.\n\nA patch was published in 2019 for this vulnerability but did not appear to have solved the issue. Version 3.15.13 did remove the flaw.",
