  "summary": "Doorkeeper Improper Authentication vulnerability",
  "details": "OAuth RFC 8252 says  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252#section-8.6\n\n> the authorization server SHOULD NOT process authorization requests automatically without user consent or interaction, except when the identity of the client can be assured. **This includes the case where the user has previously approved an authorization request for a given client id**\n\nBut Doorkeeper automatically processes authorization requests without user consent for public clients that have been previously approved. Public clients are inherently vulnerable to impersonation, their identity cannot be assured.\n\nIssue https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/issues/1589\n\nFix https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/pull/1646",
