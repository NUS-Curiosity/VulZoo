  "summary": "LeafKit allows XSS with untrusted user input",
  "details": "### Impact\nThis affects anyone passing unsanitised data to Leaf's variable tags. Before this fix, Leaf would not escape any strings passed to tags as variables. If an attacker managed to find a variable that was rendered with their unsanitised data, they could inject scripts into a generated Leaf page, which could enable XSS attacks if other mitigations such as a Content Security Policy were not enabled.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in 1.3.0\n\n### Workarounds\nSanitise any untrusted input before passing it to Leaf and enable a CSP to block inline script and CSS data.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit-ghsa-rv3x-xq3r-8j9h/pull/1\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Leaf Kit](https://github.com/vapor/leaf-kit)\n* Email us at [security@vapor.codes](mailto:security@vapor.codes)",
