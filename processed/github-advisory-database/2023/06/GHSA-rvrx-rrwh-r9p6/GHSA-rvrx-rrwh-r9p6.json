  "summary": "Notation's default `maxSignatureAttempts` in `notation verify` enables an endless data attack",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn attacker who controls or compromises a registry can make the registry serve an infinite number of signatures for the artifact, causing a denial of service to the host machine running `notation verify`.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed in the release [v1.0.0-rc.6](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6). Users should upgrade their notation packages to [v1.0.0-rc.6](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6) or above.\n\n### Workarounds\nUser should use secure and trusted container registries\n\n### Credits\nThe `notation` project would like to thank Adam Korczynski (@AdamKorcz) for responsibly disclosing the issue found during an security audit (facilitated by OSTIF and sponsored by CNCF) and Shiwei Zhang (@shizhMSFT) for root cause analysis.",
