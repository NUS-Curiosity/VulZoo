  "summary": "@udecode/plate-link does not sanitize URLs to prevent use of the `javascript:` scheme",
  "details": "### Impact\nAffected versions of the link plugin and link UI component do not sanitize URLs to prevent use of the `javascript:` scheme. As a result, links with JavaScript URLs can be inserted into the Plate editor through various means, including opening or pasting malicious content.\n\n### Patches\n`@udecode/plate-link` 20.0.0 resolves this issue by introducing an `allowedSchemes` option to the link plugin, defaulting to `['http', 'https', 'mailto', 'tel']`. URLs using a scheme that isn't in this list will not be rendered to the DOM.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are unable to update `@udecode/plate-link` to version 20.0.0, we recommend overriding the `LinkElement` and `PlateFloatingLink` components with implementations that explicitly check the URL scheme before rendering any anchor elements.\n",
