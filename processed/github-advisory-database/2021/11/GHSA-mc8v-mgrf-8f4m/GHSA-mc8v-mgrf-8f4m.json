  "summary": "Clarify Content-Type handling",
  "details": "### Impact\nIn the OCI Distribution Specification version 1.0.0 and prior, the Content-Type header alone was used to determine the type of document during push and pull operations. Documents that contain both “manifests” and “layers” fields could be interpreted as either a manifest or an index in the absence of an accompanying Content-Type header. If a Content-Type header changed between two pulls of the same digest, a client may interpret the resulting content differently.\n\n### Patches\nThe OCI Distribution Specification will be updated to require that a `mediaType` value present in a manifest or index match the Content-Type header used during the push and pull operations.\n\n### Workarounds\nClients pulling from a registry may distrust the Content-Type header and reject an ambiguous document that contains both “manifests” and “layers” fields or “manifests” and “config” fields.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/security/advisories/GHSA-77vh-xpmg-72qh\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/\n* Email us at security@opencontainers.org\n",
