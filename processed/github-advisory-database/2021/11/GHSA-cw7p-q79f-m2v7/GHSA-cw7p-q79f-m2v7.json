  "summary": "incomplete JupyterHub logout with simultaneous JupyterLab sessions",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUsers of JupyterLab with JupyterHub who have multiple JupyterLab tabs open in the same browser session, may see incomplete logout from the single-user server, as fresh credentials (for the single-user server only, not the Hub) reinstated after logout, if another active JupyterLab session is open while the logout takes place.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to JupyterHub 1.5. For distributed deployments, it is jupyterhub in the _user_ environment that needs patching. There are no patches necessary in the Hub environment.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only workaround is to make sure that only one JupyterLab tab is open when you log out.",
