  "summary": "RCE vulnerability affecting v1beta3 templates in @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend",
  "details": "The templating library used by the scaffolder backend assumes that templates are trusted which is an undesired property of the scaffolder-backend. This has now been mitigated by sandboxing the template code execution.\n\n### Impact\nA malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template yaml definition itself and not by user input data.\n\n### Patches\nThis is vulnerability is patched in version `0.15.14` of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.\n\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\n* Visit our chat, linked to in [Backstage README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)",
