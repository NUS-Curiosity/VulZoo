  "summary": "ReDos vulnerability on guest checkout email validation",
  "details": "### Impact\nDenial of service vulnerability that could be exploited during a guest checkout. The regular expression used to validate a guest order's email was subject to exponential backtracking through a fragment like `a.a.`.\n\nBefore the patch, it can be reproduced in the console like this:\n\n```ruby\nirb(main)> Spree::EmailValidator::EMAIL_REGEXP.match \"a@a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.a.@\"\nprocessing time: 54.293660s\n=> nil\n```\n\nTo reproduce in the browser, fill in the \"Customer Email\" field with that fake email address during a guest checkout. Before that, you should open the browser dev tools and change the `type` attribute for that field from `email` to `text`. After entering a fake address and pressing the \"Save & Continue\" button, the browser will take a long term to perform the request before showing an error message for the invalid address. Eventually, making the email string even longer could lead to the exhaustion of server resources.\n\n\n### Patches\nVersions 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have been patched to use a different regular expression.\n\nThere's an improbable chance that some orders in your system end up having associated an email address that is no longer valid. We've added a task to check precisely that:\n\n```bash\nbin/rails solidus:check_orders_with_invalid_email\n```\n\nThe above will print information for every affected order if any.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf a prompt upgrade is not an option, please, add the following to `config/application.rb`:\n\n```ruby\nconfig.after_initialize do\n  Spree::EmailValidator.send(:remove_const, :EMAIL_REGEXP)\n  Spree::EmailValidator::EMAIL_REGEXP = URI::MailTo::EMAIL_REGEXP\nend\n```\n\n### References\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS\n- https://snyk.io/blog/redos-and-catastrophic-backtracking/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an [issue](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/issues) or a [discussion](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/discussions) in Solidus.\n* Email us at [security@solidus.io](mailto:security@soliidus.io)\n* Contact the core team on [Slack](http://slack.solidus.io/)\n",
