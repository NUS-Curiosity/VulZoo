  "summary": "Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability in @joeattardi/emoji-button",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThere are two vectors for XSS attacks with versions of @joeattardi/emoji-button before 4.6.2:\n\n- A URL for a custom emoji\n- An i18n string\n\nIn both of these cases, a value can be crafted such that it can insert a `script` tag into the page and execute malicious code.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability is fixed starting in version 4.6.2. This is resolved by properly escaping strings that are inserted into the HTML document.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround other than upgrading to a non-vulnerable version.\n\n### Credit\n\nThis issue was discovered by GitHub team member [@erik-krogh (Erik Krogh Kristensen)](https://github.com/erik-krogh) and was reported by the GitHub Security Lab team.",
