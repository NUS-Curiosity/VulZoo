  "summary": "Lack of protection against cookie tossing attacks in fastify-csrf",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nUsers that used fastify-csrf with the \"double submit\" mechanism using cookies with an application deployed across multiple subdomains, e.g. \"heroku\"-style platform as a service. \n\n### Patches\n\nVersion 3.1.0 of the fastify-csrf fixes it. \nSee https://github.com/fastify/fastify-csrf/pull/51 and https://github.com/fastify/csrf/pull/2.\n\nThe user of the module would need to supply a `userInfo` when generating the CSRF token to fully implement the protection on their end. This is needed only for applications hosted on different subdomains.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone available.\n\n### References\n\n1. https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html\n2. https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/David_Johansson-Double_Defeat_of_Double-Submit_Cookie.pdf\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was found by Xhelal Likaj <xhelallikaj20@gmail.com>.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [fastify-csrf](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-csrf)\n* Email us at [hello@matteocollina.com](mailto:hello@matteocollina.com)\n",
