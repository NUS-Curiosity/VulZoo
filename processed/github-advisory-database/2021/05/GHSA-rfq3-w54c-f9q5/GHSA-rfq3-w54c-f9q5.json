  "summary": "OAuth2 Redirect URL validity does not respect query parameters and character casing for loopback addresses",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n[fosite#400](https://github.com/ory/fosite/pull/400) (released as v0.30.2) introduced a new feature for handling redirect URLs pointing to loopback interfaces ([rfc8252#section-7.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252#section-7.3)). As part of that change new behavior was introduced which failed to respect the redirect URL's (only for loopback interfaces!) query parameters\n\n1. Registering a client with allowed redirect URL `http://127.0.0.1/callback`\n2. Performing OAuth2 flow and requesting redirect URL `http://127.0.0.1/callback?bar=foo`\n3. Instead of an error, the browser is redirected to `http://127.0.0.1/callback?bar=foo` with a potentially successful OAuth2 response.\n\nas well as the host parameter (as long as the host is a loopback interface):\n\n1. Registering a client with allowed redirect URL `https://example.com/callback`\n2. Performing OAuth2 flow and requesting redirect URL `http://127.0.0.1/callback`\n3. Instead of an error, the browser is redirected to `http://127.0.0.1/callback` with a potentially successful OAuth2 response.\n\nThese bugs are only applicable in scenarios where the attacker has control over the loopback interface (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`) where the browser performing the OAuth2 flow is running.",
