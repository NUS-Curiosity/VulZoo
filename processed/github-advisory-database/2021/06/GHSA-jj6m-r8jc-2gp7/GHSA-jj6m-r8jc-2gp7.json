  "summary": "Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification) in Docker containers created by Wings ",
  "details": "### Impact\nAll versions of Pterodactyl Wings preior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to `1.4.4`.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pterodactyl)\n* Email us at `dane Ã¤t pterodactyl dot io`",
