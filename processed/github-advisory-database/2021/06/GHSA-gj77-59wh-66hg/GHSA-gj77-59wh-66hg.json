  "summary": "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Prism",
  "details": "Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).\n\n### Impact\n\nWhen Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. Do not use the following languages to highlight untrusted text.\n\n- ASCIIDoc\n- ERB\n\nOther languages are __not__ affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24.\n\n### References\n\n- PrismJS/prism#2774\n- PrismJS/prism#2688\n",
