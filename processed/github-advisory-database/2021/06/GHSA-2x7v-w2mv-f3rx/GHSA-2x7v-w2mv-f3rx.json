  "summary": "Improper Authentication in Atlassian Connect Spring Boot",
  "details": "Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Spring Boot (ACSB) in version 1.1.0 before 2.1.3 and from version 2.1.4 before 2.1.5: Atlassian Connect Spring Boot is a Java Spring Boot package for building Atlassian Connect apps. Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian Connect Spring Boot app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Spring Boot versions 1.1.0 before 2.1.3 and versions 2.1.4 before 2.1.5 erroneously accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints (such as installation) where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated re-installation events to an app.",
