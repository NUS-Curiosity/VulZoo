  "summary": "Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe `verifyWithMessage` method of `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` always returns `true` for any signature of a SHA-512 hash matching the SHA-512 hash of the message even if the signature is invalid.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to `v7.0.3` immediately to resolve this issue. Since the vulnerability lies within the verification method, the previous signatures are still valid. We highly recommend reverifying any signatures that were previously verified with the vulnerable `verifyWithMessage` method.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn `tenvoy.js` under the `verifyWithMessage` method definition within the `tEnvoyNaClSigningKey` class, ensure that the return statement call to `this.verify` ends in `.verified`. For example, the return statement should start with `return this.verify(signed, password).verified && ` instead of `return this.verify(signed, password) && `.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [github.com/TogaTech/tEnvoy](https://github.com/TogaTech/tEnvoy)\n",
