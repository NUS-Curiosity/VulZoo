  "summary": "Argo CD Insecure default administrative password",
  "details": "In Argo CD versions 1.8.0 and prior, the default admin password is set to the argocd-server pod name. For insiders with access to the cluster or logs, this issue could be abused for privilege escalation, as Argo has privileged roles. A malicious insider is the most realistic threat, but pod names are not meant to be kept secret and could wind up just about anywhere.\n\n#### Workaround:\n\nThe recommended mitigation as described in the user documentation is to use SSO integration. The default admin password should only be used for initial configuration and then [disabled](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/user-management/#disable-admin-user) or at least changed to a more secure password.",
