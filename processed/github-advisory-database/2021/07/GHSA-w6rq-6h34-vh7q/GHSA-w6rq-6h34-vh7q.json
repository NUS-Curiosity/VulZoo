  "summary": "Cached redirect poisoning via X-Forwarded-Host header",
  "details": "A user supplied `X-Forwarded-Host` header can be used to perform cache poisoning of a cache fronting a Ratpack server if the cache key does not include the `X-Forwarded-Host` header as a cache key.\n\nUsers are only vulnerable if they do not configure a custom `PublicAddress` instance. A custom `PublicAddress` can be specified by using [ServerConfigBuilder::publicAddress](https://ratpack.io/manual/current/api/ratpack/server/ServerConfigBuilder.html#publicAddress-java.net.URI-). For versions prior to 1.9.0, by default, Ratpack utilizes an inferring version of `PublicAddress` which is vulnerable.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis can be used to perform redirect cache poisoning where an attacker can force a cached redirect to redirect to their site instead of the intended redirect location.\n\n### Patches\n\nAs of Ratpack 1.9.0, two changes have been made that mitigate this vulnerability:\n\n1. The default PublicAddress implementation no longer infers the address from the request context, instead relying on the configured bind host/port\n2. Relative redirects issued by the application are no longer absolutized; they are passed through as-is\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn production, ensure that [ServerConfigBuilder::publicAddress](https://ratpack.io/manual/current/api/ratpack/server/ServerConfigBuilder.html#publicAddress-java.net.URI-) correctly configures the server.\n\n### References\n - https://portswigger.net/web-security/web-cache-poisoning",
