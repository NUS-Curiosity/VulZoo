  "summary": "Verification flaw in Solid identity-token-verifier",
  "details": "### Impact\n#### Severity\nAny Pod on a Solid server using a vulnerable version of the identity-token-verifier library is at risk of a spoofed Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession (DPoP) token binding. This vulnerability could give total and complete access to a targeted Pod.\n\n#### Summary\nA verification flaw in the implementation of the identity token verifier library (https://github.com/solid/identity-token-verifier) allows DPoP proofs to be spoofed. \n\nDPoP proofs are used to bind access tokens to a private key meant to be in sole possession of a specific user. Instead of verifying against the hash of an embedded public key, the library instead verifies against a field that an attacker can modify to spoof another userâ€™s DPoP. \n\nA stolen DPoP proof, when used in the right context, therefore allows the rebinding of a DPoP-bound access token. Any attacker in possession of a targeted access token could build an attack environment to replay it on any Pod service with this vulnerability.  \n\n\n### Patches\nA new version 0.5.2 of identity-token-verifier fixes the verification: https://github.com/solid/identity-token-verifier/blob/7e18d86d65ee681e8ae912b6a032a1bae3cae570/src/lib/DPoP.ts#L25-L35\n\n### Workarounds\nNone\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [identity-token-verifier](https://github.com/solid/identity-token-verifier/) repository.\n* Email: info@solidproject.org",
