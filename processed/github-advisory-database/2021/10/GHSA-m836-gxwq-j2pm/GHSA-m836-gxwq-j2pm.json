[low] A user allowed to list objects in a repository _or_ read repository meta-data may retrieve graveler information about the location on underlying storage of all objects stored in any commit that they can view.  If the user additionally has the capability to read underlying storage, they will be able to retrieve metadata associated with all objects in that commit.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please:\n* Email us at security@treeverse.io.\n* Open an issue on https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/issues/new.\n",
