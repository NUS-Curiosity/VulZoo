  "summary": "Data races in bunch",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in the bunch crate through 2020-11-12 for Rust. \nAffected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Send`/`Sync` for `Bunch<T>`.\nThis allows users to insert `T: !Sync` to `Bunch<T>`. It is possible to create a data race to a `T: !Sync` by invoking the `Bunch::get()` API (which returns `&T`) from multiple threads. It is also possible to send `T: !Send` to other threads by inserting `T` inside `Bunch<T>` and sending `Bunch<T>` to another thread, allowing to create a data race by inserting types like `T = Rc<_>`.\n\nSuch data races can lead to memory corruption.",
