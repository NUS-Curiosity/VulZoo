  "summary": "Data races on syncpool",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implements `Send` for `Bucket2`. This allows sending non-Send types to other threads.\n\nThis can lead to data races when non Send types like `Cell<T>` or `Rc<T>` are contained inside `Bucket2` and sent across thread boundaries. The data races can potentially lead to memory corruption (as demonstrated in the PoC from the original report issue).\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `15b2828` by adding a `T: Send` bound to the `Send` impl of `Bucket2<T>`.\n",
