  "summary": "OS Command Injection in OpenTSDB",
  "details": "A remote code execution vulnerability occurs in OpenTSDB through 2.4.0 via command injection in the yrange parameter. The yrange value is written to a gnuplot file in the /tmp directory. This file is then executed via the mygnuplot.sh shell script. (tsd/GraphHandler.java attempted to prevent command injections by blocking backticks but this is insufficient.)",
