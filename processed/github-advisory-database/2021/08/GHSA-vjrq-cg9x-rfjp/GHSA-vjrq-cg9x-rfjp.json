  ],
  "summary": "Improper Input Validation in cookie",
  "details": "Affected versions of this crate use the time crate and the method Duration::seconds to parse the Max-Age duration cookie setting. This method will panic if the value is greater than 2^64/1000 and less than or equal to 2^64, which can result in denial of service for a client or server.\n\nThis flaw was corrected by explicitly checking for the Max-Age being in this integer range and clamping the value to the maximum duration value.",
