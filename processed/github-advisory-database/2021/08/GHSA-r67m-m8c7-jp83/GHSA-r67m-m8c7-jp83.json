  "summary": "Cachet vulnerable to forced reinstall",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAuthenticated users, regardless of their privileges (_User_ or _Admin_), can trick Cachet and install the instance again, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue was addressed by improving the middleware `ReadyForUse`, which now performs a stricter validation of the instance name. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nOnly allow trusted source IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard.\n\n### References\n\n- https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, you can contact:\n- The original reporters, by sending an email to vulnerability.research [at] sonarsource.com;\n- The maintainers, by opening an issue on this repository.\n",
