  "summary": "Ethereum Contains Consensus Flaw During Block Processing",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA vulnerability in the Geth EVM could cause a node to reject the canonical chain. \n\n### Description \n\nA memory-corruption bug within the EVM can cause a consensus error, where vulnerable nodes obtain a different `stateRoot` when processing a maliciously crafted transaction. This, in turn, would lead to the chain being split in two forks.\n\nAll Geth versions supporting the London hard fork are vulnerable (which predates London), so all users should update.\n\nThis bug was exploited on Mainnet at block 13107518, leading to a minority chain split. \n\n### Patches\n\nA patch is included in the `v1.10.8` release.\nThe exact patch to fix the issue is contained within this [commit](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23381/commits/4d4879cafd1b3c906fc184a8c4a357137465128f)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds exist, save to update and/or apply the patch commit. \n\n### References. \n\nPost-mortem [write-up](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/docs/postmortems/2021-08-22-split-postmortem.md).\n\n### Credits\n\nThe bug was found by @guidovranken (working for [Sentnl](https://sentnl.io/) during an audit of the [Telos EVM](https://www.telos.net/evm)) and reported via bounty@ethereum.org.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/)\n* Email us at [security@ethereum.org](mailto:security@ethereum.org)\n",
