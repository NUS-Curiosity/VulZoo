  ],
  "summary": "Improperly Implemented path matching for in-toto-golang",
  "details": "### Impact\nAuthenticated attackers posing as functionaries (i.e., within a trusted set of users for a layout) are able to create attestations that may bypass DISALLOW rules in the same layout. An attacker with access to trusted private keys, may issue an attestation that contains a disallowed artifact by including path traversal semantics (e.g., foo vs dir/../foo).\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed in version 0.3.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nExploiting this vulnerability is dependent on the specific policy applied.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [in-toto-golang](http://github.com/in-toto/in-toto-golang)\n* Email us at [in-toto-public](mailto:in-toto-public@googlegroups.com)\n* If this is a sensitive security-relevant disclosure, please send a PGP encrypted email to santiagotorres@purdue.edu or jcappos@nyu.edu\n",
