  "summary": "Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime in detect-character-encoding",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIn detect-character-encoding v0.3.0 and earlier, allocated memory is not released.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in [detect-character-encoding v0.3.1](https://github.com/sonicdoe/detect-character-encoding/releases/tag/v0.3.1).\n\n### CVSS score\n\n[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/RL:O/RC:C)\n\nBase Score: 7.5 (High)\nTemporal Score: 7.2 (High)\n\nSince detect-character-encoding is a library, the scoring is based on the “[reasonable worst-case implementation scenario](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/user-guide#3-7-Scoring-Vulnerabilities-in-Software-Libraries-and-Similar)”, namely, using detect-character-encoding in a program accessible over the internet which becomes unavailable when running out of memory. Depending on your specific implementation, the vulnerability’s severity in your program may be different.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\n```js\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst detectCharacterEncoding = require(\"detect-character-encoding\");\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => {\n  detectCharacterEncoding(Buffer.from(\"foo\"));\n\n  res.end();\n});\n\napp.listen(3000);\n```\n\n`hey -n 1000000 http://localhost:3000` ([`hey`](https://github.com/rakyll/hey)) causes the Node.js process to consume more and more memory.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/sonicdoe/detect-character-encoding/commit/d44356927b92e3b13e178071bf6d7c671766f588\n- https://github.com/sonicdoe/detect-character-encoding/pull/6",
