  "summary": "Elvish vulnerable to remote code execution via the web UI backend",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nElvish's backend for the experimental web UI (started by `elvish -web`) hosts an endpoint that allows executing the code sent from the web UI.\n\nThe backend does not check the origin of requests correctly. As a result, if the user has the web UI backend open and visits a compromised or malicious website, the website can send arbitrary code to the endpoint in localhost.\n\n### Patches\n\nAll Elvish releases since 0.14.0 no longer include the experimental web UI, although it is still possible for the user to build a version from source that includes it.\n\nThe issue can be patched for previous versions by removing the web UI (found in web, pkg/web or pkg/prog/web, depending on the exact version).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not use the experimental web UI.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email xiaqqaix@gmail.com.",
