  "summary": "[thi.ng/egf] Potential arbitrary code execution of `#gpg`-tagged property values",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nPotential for arbitrary code execution in `#gpg`-tagged property values (only if `decrypt: true` option is enabled)\n\n### Patches\n\n[A fix](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/3e14765d6bfd8006742c9e7860bc7d58ae94dfa5) has already been released as v0.4.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nBy default, EGF parse functions do NOT attempt to decrypt values (since GPG is only available in non-browser env).\n\nHowever, if GPG encrypted values are used/required:\n\n1. Perform a regex search for `#gpg`-tagged values in the EGF source file/string and check for backtick (\\`) chars in the encrypted value string\n2. Replace/remove them or skip parsing if present...\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/security/advisories/GHSA-rj44-gpjc-29r7#advisory-comment-65261\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please open an issue in the [thi.ng/umbrella repo](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/issues), of which this package is part of.",
