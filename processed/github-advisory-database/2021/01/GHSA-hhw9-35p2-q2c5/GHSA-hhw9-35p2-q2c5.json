  "summary": "Steam Socialite Provider v1 does not correctly validate openid server",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe outdated version 1 of the Steam Socialite Provider doesn't check properly if the login comes from `steamcommunity.com`, allowing a malicious actor to substitute their own openID server.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability only affects the outdated v1.x versions of the package. These are no longer maintained, users should upgrade to v3 or v4, which use a hardcoded endpoint to verify the login.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [SocialiteProviders/Providers](https://github.com/SocialiteProviders/Providers)\n* Email us at [socialite@atymic.dev](mailto:socialite@atymic.dev)",
