  "summary": "PyCA Cryptography symmetrically encrypting large values can lead to integer overflow",
  "details": "cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. When certain sequences of `update()` calls with large values (multiple GBs) for symetric encryption or decryption occur, it's possible for an integer overflow to happen, leading to mishandling of buffers. This is patched in version 3.3.2 and newer.\n",
