  "summary": "October CMS Session ID not invalidated after logout",
  "details": "### Impact\nWhen logging out, the session ID was not invalidated. This is not a problem while the user is logged out, but as soon as the user logs back in the old session ID would be valid again; which means that anyone that gained access to the old session cookie would be able to act as the logged in user. This is not a major concern for the majority of cases, since it requires a malicious party gaining access to the session cookie in the first place, but nevertheless has been fixed.\n\n### Patches\nIssue has been patched in Build 472 (v1.0.472) and v1.1.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nApply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/642f597489e6f644d4bd9a0c267e864cabead024 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 472 or v1.1.2.\n\n### References\n- Reported by Anisio (Brazilian Information Security Analyst)\n- http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-3311\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)\n\n### Threat assessment:\n<img width=\"699\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-07 at 11 50 35 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7253840/107180881-51eaf000-699f-11eb-8828-333128faf2a6.png\">",
