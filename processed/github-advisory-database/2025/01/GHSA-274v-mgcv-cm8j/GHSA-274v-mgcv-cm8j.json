  "summary": "Argo CD GitOps Engine does not scrub secret values from patch errors",
  "details": "### Impact\nA vulnerability was discovered in Argo CD that exposed secret values in error messages and the diff view when an invalid Kubernetes Secret resource was synced from a repository. \n\nThe vulnerability assumes the user has write access to the repository and can exploit it, either intentionally or unintentionally, by committing an invalid Secret to repository and triggering a Sync. Once exploited, any user with read access to Argo CD can view the exposed secret data.\n\n### Patches\nA patch for this vulnerability is available in the following Argo CD versions:\n- v2.13.4\n- v2.12.10\n- v2.11.13\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround other than upgrading.\n\n### References\nFixed with commit https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/commit/6f5537bdf15ddbaa0f27a1a678632ff0743e4107 & https://github.com/argoproj/gitops-engine/commit/7e21b91e9d0f64104c8a661f3f390c5e6d73ddca",
