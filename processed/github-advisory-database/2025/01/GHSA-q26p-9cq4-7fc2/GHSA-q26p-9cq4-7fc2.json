  "summary": "Go Ethereum vulnerable to DoS via malicious p2p message",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nA vulnerable node can be forced to shutdown/crash using a specially crafted message.\n\nDuring the peer-to-peer connection handshake, a shared secret key is computed. The implementation\ndid not verify whether the EC public key provided by the remote party is a valid point on the secp256k1 curve.\nBy simply sending an all-zero public key, a crash could be induced due to unexpected results from the handshake.\n\nThe issue was fixed by adding a curve point validity check in https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/159fb1a1db551c544978dc16a5568a4730b4abf3\n\n### Patches\n\nA fix has been included in geth version 1.14.13 and onwards.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUnfortunately, no workaround is available.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis issue was originally reported to Polygon Security by David Matosse (@iam-ned).",
