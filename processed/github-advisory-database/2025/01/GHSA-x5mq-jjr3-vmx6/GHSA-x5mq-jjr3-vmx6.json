  "summary": "Missing validation of header name and value in codeigniter4/framework",
  "details": "### Impact\nLack of proper header validation for its name and value. The potential attacker can construct deliberately malformed headers with `Header` class. This could disrupt application functionality, potentially causing errors or generating invalid HTTP requests. In some cases, these malformed requests might lead to a DoS scenario if a remote serviceâ€™s web application firewall interprets them as malicious and blocks further communication with the application.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to v4.5.8 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nValidate HTTP header keys and/or values if using user-supplied values before passing them to `Header` class.\n\n### Differences from CVE-2023-29197\n\n1. **Affected Software**:\n    * CVE-2023-29197 specifically addresses a vulnerability in the `guzzlehttp/psr7` library.\n    * The reported issue in this Security Advisory is within the **CodeIgniter4** framework and does not depend on or use the `guzzlehttp/psr7` library.\n\n2. **Root Cause and Implementation**:\n    * The vulnerability reported arises from an issue in the **Header class** of CodeIgniter4, which is unrelated to the functionality or implementation of `guzzlehttp/psr7`.\n\n3. **Scope of Impact**:\n    * The vulnerability described in this Security Advisory affects applications built with the **CodeIgniter4** framework, which does not use or rely on the `guzzlehttp/psr7` library.\n\n### References\n* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.2\n* https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wxmh-65f7-jcvw",
