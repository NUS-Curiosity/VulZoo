  "summary": "Crayfish allows Remote Code Execution via Homarus Authorization header",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nRemote code execution may be possible in web-accessible installations of Homarus in certain configurations.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in `islandora/crayfish:4.1.0`\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe exploit requires making a request against the Homarus's `/convert` endpoint; therefore, the ability to exploit is much reduced if the microservice is not directly accessible from the Internet, so: Prevent general access from the Internet from hitting Homarus.\n\nConfigure auth in Crayfish to be more strongly required, such that requests with `Authorization` headers that do not validate are rejected before the problematic CLI interpolation occurs.\n\n### References\n\n- XBOW-024-071",
