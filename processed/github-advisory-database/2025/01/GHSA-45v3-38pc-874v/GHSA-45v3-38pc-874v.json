  "summary": "notation-go's timestamp signature generation lacks certificate revocation check",
  "details": "This issue was identified during Quarkslab's audit of the timestamp feature.\n\n### Summary\nDuring the timestamp signature generation, the revocation status of the certificate(s) used to generate the timestamp signature was not verified.\n\n### Details\nDuring timestamp signature generation, notation-go did not check the revocation status of the certificate chain used by the TSA. This oversight creates a vulnerability that could be exploited through a Man-in-The-Middle attack. An attacker could potentially use a compromised, intermediate, or revoked leaf certificate to generate a malicious countersignature, which would then be accepted and stored by `notation`.\n\n### Impact\nThis could lead to denial of service scenarios, particularly in CI/CD environments during signature verification processes because timestamp signature would fail due to the presence of a revoked certificate(s) potentially disrupting operations.\n",
