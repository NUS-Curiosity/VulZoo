  "summary": "Trix allows Cross-site Scripting via `javascript:` url in a link",
  "details": "The Trix editor, versions prior to 2.1.11, is vulnerable to XSS when pasting malicious code in the link field.\n\n### Impact\n\nAn attacker could trick the user to copy&paste a malicious `javascript:` URL as a link that would execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed.\n\nSee https://gist.github.com/th4s1s/3921fd9c3e324ad9a3e0d846166e3eb8\n\n### Patches\n\nUpdate Recommendation: Users should upgrade to Trix editor version 2.1.12 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThis is not really a workaround but something that should be considered in addition to upgrading to the patched version. If affected users can disallow browsers that don't support a Content Security Policy, then this would be an effective workaround for this and all XSS vulnerabilities. Set CSP policies such as script-src 'self' to ensure that only scripts hosted on the same origin are executed, and explicitly prohibit inline scripts using script-src-elem.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/th4s1s/3921fd9c3e324ad9a3e0d846166e3eb8\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was reported by Hackerone researcher https://hackerone.com/lio346?type=user",
