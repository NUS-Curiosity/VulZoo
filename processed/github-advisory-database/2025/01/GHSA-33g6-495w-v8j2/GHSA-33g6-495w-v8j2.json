  "summary": "Snowflake JDBC uses insecure temporary credential cache file permissions",
  "details": "### Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the Snowflake JDBC Driver. On Linux systems, when temporary credential caching is enabled, the Snowflake JDBC Driver will cache temporary credentials locally in a world-readable file.\n\nThis vulnerability affects versions 3.6.8 through 3.21.0. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.22.0.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nOn Linux, when either EXTERNALBROWSER or USERNAME_PASSWORD_MFA authentication methods are used with temporary credential caching enabled, the Snowflake JDBC Driver will cache temporary credentials in a local file. In the vulnerable versions of the Driver, this file is created with world-readable permissions.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake released version 3.22.0 of the Snowflake JDBC Driver, which fixes this issue. We recommend users upgrade to version 3.22.0.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne.
