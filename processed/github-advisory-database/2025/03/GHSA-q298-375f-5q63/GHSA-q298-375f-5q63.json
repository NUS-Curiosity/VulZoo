  "summary": "Snowflake JDBC Driver client-side encryption key in DEBUG logs",
  "details": "### Issue\nSnowflake discovered and remediated a vulnerability in the Snowflake JDBC driver (“Driver”). When the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver would log locally the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. This key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data without additional access authorizations,  and is not logged server-side by Snowflake.\n\nThis vulnerability affects Driver versions 3.0.13 through 3.23.0. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.23.1.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nWhen the logging level was set to DEBUG, the Driver would locally log the client-side encryption master key of the target stage during the execution of GET/PUT commands. The key was logged in a JSON object under the queryStageMasterKey key. The key by itself does not grant access to any sensitive data.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake released version 3.23.1 of the Snowflake JDBC driver, which fixes this issue. We highly recommend users upgrade to version 3.23.1.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to Snowflake through our Vulnerability Disclosure Program hosted at HackerOne.
