  "summary": " Formwork has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Site title",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nThe site title field at /panel/options/site/allows embedding JS tags, which can be used to attack all members of the system. This is a widespread attack and can cause significant damage if there is a considerable number of users.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe attack is widespread, leveraging what XSS can do. This will undoubtedly impact system availability.\n\n### Patches\n- [**Formwork 2.x** (aa3e9c6)](https://github.com/getformwork/formwork/commit/aa3e9c684035d9e8495169fde7c57d97faa3f9a2) escapes site title from panel header navigation.\n\n### Details\n\nBy embedding \"<!--\", the source code can be rendered non-functional, significantly impacting system availability. However, the attacker would need admin privileges, making the attack more difficult to execute.\n\n### PoC\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fc68f6f-8bc4-4b97-8b93-dee5b88a3fcf)\n\n1. The page where the vulnerability was found, and the attack surface is the Title field.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbf94354-7115-4d3b-81ba-6b6aff561b81)\n\n2. I tested accessing the Dashboard page using a regular user account with Firefox, a different browser, and found that it was also affected.\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e72129a-7f2d-4f0e-b85e-0b1cedfd377e)\n\n3. Additionally, the remaining code was commented out to disrupt the UX/UI, making it difficult to revert the settings.",
