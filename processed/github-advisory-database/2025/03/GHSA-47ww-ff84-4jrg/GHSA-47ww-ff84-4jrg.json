  "details": "Name: ISA-2025-002: x/group can halt when erroring in EndBlocker\nComponent: CosmosSDK\nCriticality: High (Considerable Impact; Likely Likelihood per [ACMv1.2](https://github.com/interchainio/security/blob/main/resources/CLASSIFICATION_MATRIX.md))\nAffected versions: <= v0.47.16, <= 0.50.12\nAffected users: Validators, Full nodes, Users on chains that utilize the groups module\nCosmos SDK chains in unpatched releases that use the `x/group` module are affected.\n\n### Description\n\nAn issue was discovered in the groups module where malicious proposals would result in an errors triggered in the module's end blocker that could result in a chain halt.  Any set of users that can interact with the groups module could introduce this state.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nThe new Cosmos SDK release [v0.50.13](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.50.13) and [v0.47.17](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.47.17) fix this issue.\n\n### Testing\n\nTesting we have done to gain more confidence in this release:\n\nIn addition to testing Cosmos SDK we also did the following:\n\n- Ran a patched node in a local `v0.50` testnet with the failing state and did not halt (an unpatched network confirmed to halt)\n- Ran a patched node on Xion Mainnet (uses `x/group`)\n- Ran a patched node on Zetachain Mainnet (uses `x/xgroup`)\n    \n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue. It is advised that chains apply the update.\n\nThis issue was reported to the Cosmos Bug Bounty Program by [dongsam](https://github.com/dongsam) on HackerOne on February 28, 2025.
