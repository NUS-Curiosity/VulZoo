  "details": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nA vulnerability in `OpenTelemetry.Api` package `1.10.0` to `1.11.1` could cause a Denial of Service (DoS) when a `tracestate` and `traceparent` header is received.\n\n* Even if an application does not explicitly use trace context propagation, receiving these headers can still trigger high CPU usage.\n* This issue impacts any application accessible over the web or backend services that process HTTP requests containing a `tracestate` header.\n* Application may experience excessive resource consumption, leading to increased latency, degraded performance, or downtime.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nThis issue has been <strong data-start=\"1143\" data-end=\"1184\">resolved in OpenTelemetry.Api 1.11.2</strong> by <strong data-start=\"1188\" data-end=\"1212\">reverting the change</strong> that introduced the problematic behavior in versions <strong data-start=\"1266\" data-end=\"1286\">1.10.0 to 1.11.1</strong>.</li><li data-start=\"1290\" data-end=\"1409\">The fix ensures that <strong data-start=\"1313\" data-end=\"1380\">valid tracing headers no longer cause excessive CPU consumption</strong> when received in requests.</li></ul><h4 data-start=\"1411\" data-end=\"1434\"><strong data-start=\"1416\" data-end=\"1434\">Fixed Version:</strong></h4>\nOpenTelemetry .NET Version | Status\n-- | --\n<= 1.9.x | ✅ Not affected\n1.10.0 - 1.11.1 | ❌ Vulnerable\n1.11.2 (Fixed) | ✅ Safe to use\n\n**Upgrade Command:**\n\n```\ndotnet add package OpenTelemetry --version 1.11.2\n```\n\n**Delisting of Affected Packages**\nTo prevent accidental usage, we have delisted the affected versions (1.10.0 to 1.11.1) from NuGet. Users should avoid these versions and upgrade to 1.11.2 immediately.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_",
