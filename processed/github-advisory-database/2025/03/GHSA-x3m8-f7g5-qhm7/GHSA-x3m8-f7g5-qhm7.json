  "summary": "vLLM Allows Remote Code Execution via Mooncake Integration",
  "details": "### Summary\nWhen vLLM is configured to use Mooncake, unsafe deserialization exposed directly over ZMQ/TCP on all network interfaces will allow attackers to execute remote code on distributed hosts.\n\n### Details\n1. Pickle deserialization vulnerabilities are [well documented](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).\n2. The [mooncake pipe](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/9bebc9512f9340e94579b9bd69cfdc452c4d5bb0/vllm/distributed/kv_transfer/kv_pipe/mooncake_pipe.py#L206) is exposed over the network (by design to enable disaggregated prefilling across distributed environments) using ZMQ over TCP, greatly increasing exploitability. Further, the mooncake integration opens these sockets listening on all interfaces on the host, meaning it can not be configured to only use a private, trusted network.\n4. The root problem is [`recv_tensor()`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/9bebc9512f9340e94579b9bd69cfdc452c4d5bb0/vllm/distributed/kv_transfer/kv_pipe/mooncake_pipe.py#L257) calls [`_recv_impl`](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/9bebc9512f9340e94579b9bd69cfdc452c4d5bb0/vllm/distributed/kv_transfer/kv_pipe/mooncake_pipe.py#L244) which passes the raw network bytes to `pickle.loads()`. Additionally, it does not appear that there are any controls (network, authentication, etc) to prevent arbitrary users from sending this payload to the affected service.\n\n### Impact\nThis is a remote code execution vulnerability impacting any deployments using Mooncake to distribute KV across distributed hosts.\n\n### Remediation\nThis issue is resolved by https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/14228",
