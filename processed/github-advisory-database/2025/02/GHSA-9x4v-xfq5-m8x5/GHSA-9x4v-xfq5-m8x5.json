  "details": "### Summary\nThe better-auth `/api/auth/error` page was vulnerable to HTML injection, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.\n\n### Details\nThe value of `error` URL parameter was reflected as HTML on the error page: https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/blob/05ada0b79dbcac93cc04ceb79b23ca598d07830c/packages/better-auth/src/api/routes/error.ts#L81\n\n### PoC\n\nhttps://demo.better-auth.com/api/auth/error?error=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35b1b95d-3dc9-45fd-89cd-20cd0361bb6c)\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker who exploited this vulnerability by coercing a user to visit a specially-crafted URL could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser.\n\nBecause better-auth is a dependency of web applications, the impact of such a vulnerability is unknowable; it depends on the functionality of the application/site using better-auth. I have calculated the CVSS score assuming the hypothetical victim is an administrator with elevated permissions and access.",
