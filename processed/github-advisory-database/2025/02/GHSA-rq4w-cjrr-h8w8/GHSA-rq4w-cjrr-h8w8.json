  "details": "# Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-gvgg-2r3r-53x7. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n# Original Description\nA flaw was found in the Keycloak organization feature, which allows the incorrect assignment of an organization to a user if their username or email matches the organizationâ€™s domain pattern. This issue occurs at the mapper level, leading to misrepresentation in tokens. If an application relies on these claims for authorization, it may incorrectly assume a user belongs to an organization they are not a member of, potentially granting unauthorized access or privileges.",
