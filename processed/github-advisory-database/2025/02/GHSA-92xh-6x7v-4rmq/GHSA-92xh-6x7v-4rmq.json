  "details": "**CSRF**\n### Summary\nA cross-site request forgery vulnerability allows a remote actor to create an account with Owner privileges. By luring an Owner or Administrator into clicking a button on an attacker-controlled website, a request will be issued, generating an account with the attacker's information and role of their choosing. \n\n### Impact\nWhile the likelihood of a successful exploit is low, the impact would be high as the attacker could then gain complete control over the victim's environment.",
