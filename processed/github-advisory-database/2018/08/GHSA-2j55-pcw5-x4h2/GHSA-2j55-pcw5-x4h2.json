  "summary": "active-support impersonates 'activesupport' gem",
  "details": "The `active-support` ruby gem gem is malware and duplicates the official `activesupport` (no hyphen) gem, but adds a compiled extension. The extension attempts to resolve a base64 encoded domain (29faea63.planfhntage.de), downloads a payload, and executes.\n \nThis trojan horse gem could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by containing a malicious backdoor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.  No version of this gem should be considered safe.",
