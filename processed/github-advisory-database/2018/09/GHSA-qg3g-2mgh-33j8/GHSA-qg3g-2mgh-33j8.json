  "summary": "Sensitive Data Exposure in msrcrypto",
  "details": "Versions of `msrcrypto` prior to 1.4.1 are vulnerable to Sensitive Data Exposure. The package's Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) implementation may leak information about a server's private ECC key. It can also allow attackers to craft invalid ECDSA signatures that pass as valid. There is no published proof-of-concept for this vulnerability.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.4.1 or later.",
