  "details": "## Generated code uses repository configuration that downloads over HTTP instead of HTTPS\n\n### Impact\nGradle users were using the http://repo.spring.io/plugins-release repositories in plain HTTP, and not HTTPS, so a man-in-the-middle attack was possible at build time.\n\n### Patches\n\nMaven users should at least upgrade to 6.3.0 while Gradle users should update to 6.3.1.\nIf you are not able to upgrade make sure not to use a Maven repository via `http` in your build file.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nReplace all custom repository definitions in `build.gradle` or `pom.xml` with their `https` version.\n\ne.g.\n\n```xml\n <repository>\n            <id>oss.sonatype.org-snapshot</id>\n            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url> // <-- must be httpS\n            <releases>\n                <enabled>false</enabled>\n            </releases>\n            <snapshots>\n                <enabled>true</enabled>\n            </snapshots>\n</repository>\n```\n\n```gradle\nmaven { url \"https://repo.spring.io/plugins-release\" } // <-- must be httpS\n```\n\n### References\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\n* https://max.computer/blog/how-to-take-over-the-computer-of-any-java-or-clojure-or-scala-developer/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues)\n\n",
