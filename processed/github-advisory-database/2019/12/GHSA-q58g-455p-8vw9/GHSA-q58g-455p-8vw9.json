  ],
  "summary": "In RubyGem excon, interrupted Persistent Connections May Leak Response Data",
  "details": "### Impact\nThere was a race condition around persistent connections, where a connection which is interrupted (such as by a timeout) would leave data on the socket. Subsequent requests would then read this data, returning content from the previous response. The race condition window appears to be short, and it would be difficult to purposefully exploit this.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched in 0.71.0, users should upgrade to this or a newer version (if one exists).\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can workaround the problem by disabling persistent connections, though this may cause performance implications.\n\n### References\nSee the [patch](https://github.com/excon/excon/commit/ccb57d7a422f020dc74f1de4e8fb505ab46d8a29) for further details.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [excon/issues](https://github.com/excon/excon/issues)\n* Email us at [geemus+github@gmail.com](mailto:geemus+github@gmail.com)",
