  "summary": "Possible Information Leak / Session Hijack Vulnerability in Rack",
  "details": "There's a possible information leak / session hijack vulnerability in Rack. Attackers may be able to find and hijack sessions by using timing attacks targeting the session id. Session ids are usually stored and indexed in a database that uses some kind of scheme for speeding up lookups of that session id. By carefully measuring the amount of time it takes to look up a session, an attacker may be able to find a valid session id and hijack the session.\n\nThe session id itself may be generated randomly, but the way the session is indexed by the backing store does not use a secure comparison.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe session id stored in a cookie is the same id that is used when querying the backing session storage engine.  Most storage mechanisms (for example a database) use some sort of indexing in order to speed up the lookup of that id.  By carefully timing requests and session lookup failures, an attacker may be able to perform a timing attack to determine an existing session id and hijack that session.\n\n## Releases\n\nThe 1.6.12 and 2.0.8 releases are available at the normal locations.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for\nthe two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a\nsingle changeset.\n\n* 1-6-session-timing-attack.patch - Patch for 1.6 series\n* 2-0-session-timing-attack.patch - Patch for 2.6 series\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks Will Leinweber for reporting this!",
