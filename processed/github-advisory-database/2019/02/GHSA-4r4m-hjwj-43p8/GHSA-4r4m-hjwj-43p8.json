  "summary": "Insecure Defaults Allow MITM Over TLS in engine.io-client",
  "details": "Affected versions of `engine.io-client` do not verify certificates by default, and as such may be vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks.\n\nThe vulnerability is related to the way that node.js handles the `rejectUnauthorized` setting. If the value is something that evaluates to false, such as undefined or null, certificate verification will be disabled. \n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.6.9 or later.\n\nIf you are unable to upgrade, ensure all calls to socket.io to have a `rejectedUnauthorized: true` flag.",
