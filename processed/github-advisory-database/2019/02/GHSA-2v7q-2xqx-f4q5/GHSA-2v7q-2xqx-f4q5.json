  "summary": "Potential SQL Injection in sequelize",
  "details": "Affected versions of `sequelize` are vulnerable to SQL Injection when user input is passed into `findOne` or into a statement such as `where: \"user input\"`.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 3.0.0 or later.\n\nVersion 3.0.0 will introduce a number of breaking changes.\nThankfully, the project authors have provided a 2.x -> 3.x [upgrade guide](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/wiki/Upgrade-from-2.0-to-3.0) to ease this transition.\n\nIf upgrading is not an option, it is also possible to mitigate this by ensuring that all uses of `where: \"input\"` and `findOne(\"input\")` are properly sanitized, such as by the use of a wrapper function.",
