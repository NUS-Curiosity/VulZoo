  "summary": "Downloads Resources over HTTP in healthcenter",
  "details": "Affected versions of `healthcenter` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `healthcenter`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis package has been deprecated, and moved to a new package on npm: [`appmetrics`](https://npmjs.com/package/appmetrics).\n\nIn order to mitigate this vulnerability, please install the `appmetrics` package in place of `healthcenter` via the following commands:\n```\nnpm uninstall healthcenter -s\nnpm install appmetrics -s\n```",
