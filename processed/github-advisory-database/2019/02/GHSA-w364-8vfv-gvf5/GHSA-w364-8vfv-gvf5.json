  "summary": "Downloads Resources over HTTP in phantomjs-cheniu",
  "details": "Affected versions of `phantomjs-cheniu` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `phantomjs-cheniu`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability.\n\nAs this package is just a fork of Medium's [`phantomjs-prebuilt`](https://github.com/Medium/phantomjs) package, the best mitigation is currently to install the `Medium` version of [`phantomjs-prebuilt`](https://github.com/Medium/phantomjs). This can be done via the following command:\n```\nnpm i phantomjs-prebuilt\n```",
