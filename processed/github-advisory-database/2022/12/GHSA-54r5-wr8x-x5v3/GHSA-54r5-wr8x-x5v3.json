  "summary": "Apiman has insufficient checks for read permissions",
  "details": "Apiman 1.5.7 through 2.2.3.Final has insufficient checks for read permissions within the Apiman Manager REST API. A malicious user may be able to find and subscribe to private APIs they do not have permission for, thus accessing API Management-protected resources they should not be allowed to access. The root cause of the issue is the Apiman project's accidental acceptance of a large contribution that was not fully compatible with the security model of Apiman versions before 3.0.0.Final. Because of this, 3.0.0.Final is not affected by the vulnerability.",
