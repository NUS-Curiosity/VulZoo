  "summary": "kube-httpcache is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n> A request forgery attack can be performed on Varnish Cache servers that have the HTTP/2 protocol turned on. An attacker may introduce characters through the HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that are invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the Varnish server to produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This may in turn be used to successfully exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind the Varnish server.\n> -- https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00011.html#vsv00011\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is fixed in Varnish 6.0.11; Varnish 6.0.11 is available in `kube-httpcache` versions v0.7.1 and later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSee [upstream mitigation hints](https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00011.html#mitigation).\n\n### References\n\n- https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00011.html#vsv00011\n\n",
