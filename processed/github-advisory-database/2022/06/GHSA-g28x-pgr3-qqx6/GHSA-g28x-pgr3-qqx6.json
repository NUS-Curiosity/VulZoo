  "summary": "Octokit gem published with world-writable files",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nVersions [4.23.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.23.0) and [4.24.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.24.0) of the octokit gem were published containing world-writeable files. \n\nSpecifically, the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644). This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem. \n\nMalicious code already present and running on your machine, separate from this package, could modify the gemâ€™s files and change its behavior during runtime.\n\n### Patches\n* [octokit 4.25.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.25.0)\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can use the previous version of the gem [v4.22.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.22.0). Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able to upgrade to the latest version.\n\n",
