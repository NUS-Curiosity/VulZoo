  "details": "### Description\n\ndjango-jsonform stores the raw JSON data of the db field in a hidden textarea on the admin page. However, that data was kept in the textarea after unescaping it using the `safe` template filter. This opens up possibilities for XSS attacks.\n\nThis only affects the admin pages where the django-jsonform is rendered.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to django-jsonform version 2.10.1 or later.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/bhch/django-jsonform/issues).\n* Email the maintainer at `Bharat Chauhan <tell.bhch@gmail.com>`.\n",
