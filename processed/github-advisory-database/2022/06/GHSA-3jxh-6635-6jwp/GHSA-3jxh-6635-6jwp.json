  "summary": "Path traversal in Concrete CMS",
  "details": "Concrete 8.5.7 and below as well as Concrete 9.0 through 9.0.2 allow traversal in /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload which could result in an Arbitrary File Delete exploit. This was remediated by sanitizing /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload to ensure Concrete doesnâ€™t allow traversal and by changing isFullChunkFilePresent to have an early false return when input doesn't match expectations.Concrete CMS Security team ranked this 5.8 with CVSS v3.1 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H.
