  "details": "Jenkins sets the Content-Security-Policy header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.\n\nNeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 1.20 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins whenever the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' build step is executed. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.\n\nJenkins instances with [Resource Root URL](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/user-content/#resource-root-url) configured are unaffected.",
