  "summary": "Incorrect default cookie name and recommendation",
  "details": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nThe default cookie name (and documentation recommendation) was prefixed with `Host__` instead of `__Host-`. The point of this prefix is for additional security, to ensure that, when no domain option is provided in the cookie options, we can guarantee the cookie came from the correct domain.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nYes, the problem is patched from version 2.2.1, this will not be back ported, but you can use the workaround described below.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nYou can work around this by providing a custom `cookieName` as part of the options, which is correctly prefixed with `__Host-`.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nhttps://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#cookie-with-__host-prefix\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Reach out on the [Psifi Solutions Discord](https://psifisolutions.com/discord) in the `#psifi-support` channel\n",
