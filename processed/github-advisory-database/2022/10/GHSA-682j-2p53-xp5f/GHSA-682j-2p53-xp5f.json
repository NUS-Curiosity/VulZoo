  "details": "BMC Compuware Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and ISPW Plugin 2.0.12 and earlier implements an agent/controller message that does not limit where it can be executed.\n\nIt allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain the values of Java system properties from the Jenkins controller process.\n\nThis vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier. See the [LTS upgrade guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/upgrade-guide/2.303/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-303-3).\n\nBMC Compuware Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and ISPW Plugin 2.0.13 restricts execution of the agent/controller message to agents.",
