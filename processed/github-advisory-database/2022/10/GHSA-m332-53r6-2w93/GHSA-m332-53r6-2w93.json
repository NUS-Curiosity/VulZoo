  "summary": "etcd's WAL `ReadAll`  method vulnerable to an entry with large index causing panic",
  "details": "### Vulnerability type\nData Validation\n\n### Detail\nIn the ReadAll method in wal/wal.go, it is possible to have an entry index greater then the number of entries. This could cause issues when WAL entries are being read during consensus as an arbitrary etcd consensus participant could go down from a runtime panic when reading the entry.\n\n### References\nFind out more on this vulnerability in the [security audit report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Contact the [etcd security committee](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/security-release-process.md)",
