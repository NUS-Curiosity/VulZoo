  "summary": "Reflected XSS in querystring parameters",
  "details": "An attacker could inject a XSS payload in a Silverstripe CMS response by carefully crafting a return URL on a /dev/build or /Security/login request.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a user to follow a link with a malicious payload.\n\nThis will only affect projects configured to output PHP warnings to the browser. By default, Silverstripe CMS will only output PHP warnings if your SS_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE environment variable is set to dev. Production sites should always set SS_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE to live.",
