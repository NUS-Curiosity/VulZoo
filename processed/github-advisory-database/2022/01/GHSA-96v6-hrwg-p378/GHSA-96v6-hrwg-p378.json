  "summary": "Weak Password Requirements in Daybyday CRM",
  "details": "In Daybyday CRM, versions 1.1 through 2.2.0 enforce weak password requirements in the user update functionality. A user with privileges to update his password could change it to a weak password, such as those with a length of a single character. This may allow an attacker to brute-force usersâ€™ passwords with minimal to no computational effort.",
