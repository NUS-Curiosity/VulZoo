  "summary": "Uncapped length of skin data fields submitted by players",
  "details": "### Impact\nSome skin data fields (e.g. skinID, geometryName) are not capped in length. These fields are typically saved in the NBT data of a player when the player quits the server, or during an autosave.\n\nThis is problematic due to the 32767 byte limit on `TAG_String`s. If any of these fields exceeds 32767 bytes, an exception will be thrown during data saving, which will cause the server to crash.\n\nOther fields (such as skinGeometryData) are also uncapped, but those have a much larger 2 GB length limit, so this is not a concern for those, particularly considering the decompressed packet size limit of 2 MB.\n\n### Patches\nPM3: 958a9dbf0fe3131ab60319c5a939f5dfbfe5dfbb\nPM4: 6492cac5c10f9fa8443ceddd2191a7b65b73f601\n\n### Workarounds\nA plugin may check player skins during `PlayerLoginEvent` and `PlayerSkinChangeEvent` and ensure that the offending fields are not larger than 32767 bytes.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [team@pmmp.io](mailto:team@pmmp.io)\n",
