  "details": "We found the patch for CVE-2021-43838 in jsx-slack v4.5.1 is insufficient to save from Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attack.\n\nThis vulnerability affects to jsx-slack v4.5.1 and earlier versions.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf attacker can put a lot of JSX elements into `<blockquote>` tag _with including multibyte characters_, an internal regular expression for escaping characters may consume an excessive amount of computing resources.\n\n```javascript\n/** @jsxImportSource jsx-slack */\nimport { Section } from 'jsx-slack'\n\nconsole.log(\n  <Section>\n    <blockquote>\n      {[...Array(40)].map(() => (\n        <p>äºœ</p>\n      ))}\n    </blockquote>\n  </Section>\n)\n```\n\nv4.5.1 has released by passing the test against ASCII characters but missed the case of multibyte characters.\nhttps://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/security/advisories/GHSA-55xv-f85c-248q\n\n### Patches\n\njsx-slack v4.5.2 has updated regular expressions for escaping blockquote characters to prevent catastrophic backtracking. It is also including an updated test case to confirm rendering multiple tags in `<blockquote>` with multibyte characters.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/yhatt/jsx-slack/commit/46bc88391d89d5fda4ce689e18ca080bcdd29ecc\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to @hieki for finding out this vulnerability.",
