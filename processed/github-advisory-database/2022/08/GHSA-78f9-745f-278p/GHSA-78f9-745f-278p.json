  "summary": "Neo4j Graph apoc plugins Partial Path Traversal Vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\nA partial Directory Traversal Vulnerability found in `apoc.log.stream` function of apoc plugins in Neo4j Graph database. \nThis issue allows a malicious actor to potentially break out of the expected directory. The impact is limited to sibling directories. For example, `userControlled.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(\"/usr/out\")` will allow an attacker to access a directory with a name like `/usr/outnot`.\n\n### Patches\nThe users should aim to use the latest released version compatible with their Neo4j version. The minimum versions containing patch for this vulnerability are 4.4.0.8 and 4.3.0.7\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade the library, you can control the [allowlist of the functions](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.security.procedures.allowlist) that can be used in your system\n\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- Open an issue in [neo4j-apoc-procedures](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures)\n- Email us at [security@neo4j.com](mailto:security@neo4j.com)\n\n### Credits\nWe want to publicly recognise the contribution of [Jonathan Leitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh) for reporting this issue.\n ",
