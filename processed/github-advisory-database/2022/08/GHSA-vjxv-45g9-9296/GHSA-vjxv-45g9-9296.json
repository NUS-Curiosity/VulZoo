  "details": "`cosign verify-attestation` used with the `--type` flag will report a false positive verification when:\n\n- There is at least one attestation with a valid signature\n- There are NO attestations of the type being verified (--type defaults to \"custom\")\n\nThis can happen when signing with a standard keypair and with \"keyless\" signing with Fulcio. Users should upgrade to cosign version 1.10.1 or greater for a patch. Currently the only workaround is to upgrade.",
