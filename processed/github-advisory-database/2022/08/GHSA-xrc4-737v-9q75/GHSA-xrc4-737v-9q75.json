  "summary": "OpenZeppelin Contracts's GovernorVotesQuorumFraction updates to quorum may affect past defeated proposals",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis issue concerns instances of Governor that use the module `GovernorVotesQuorumFraction`, a mechanism that determines quorum requirements as a percentage of the voting token's total supply. In affected instances, when a proposal is passed to lower the quorum requirement, past proposals may become executable if they had been defeated only due to lack of quorum, and the number of votes it received meets the new quorum requirement.\n\nAnalysis of instances on chain found only one proposal that met this condition, and we are actively monitoring for new occurrences of this particular issue.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in v4.7.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAvoid lowering quorum requirements if a past proposal was defeated for lack of quorum.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3561\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or need assistance deploying the fix, email us at [security@openzeppelin.com](mailto:security@openzeppelin.com).",
