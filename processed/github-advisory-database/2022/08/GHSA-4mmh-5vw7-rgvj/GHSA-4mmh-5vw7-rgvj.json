  "summary": "Venice vulnerable to Partial Path Traversal issue within the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`",
  "details": "### Impact\nA partial path traversal issue exists within the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be limited to load files from a list of load paths.\n\nAssuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ \"/Users/foo/resources\" ]` \n\nWhen passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine:\n`(load-resource \"test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\n`(load-resource \"../resources-alt/test.png\")`   => rejected, outside the load path\n\nWhen passing **absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load paths:\n`(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\n`(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\" !!!\nThe latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_ vulnerability.\n\nThis issueâ€™s scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path `\"/Users/foo/resources\"`, the actor can cause loading a resource also from `\"/Users/foo/resources-alt\"`, but not from `\"/Users/foo/images\"`.\n\nVersions of Venice before and including v1.10.16 are affected by this issue.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Venice >= 1.10.17, if you are on a version < 1.10.17\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade the library, you can control the functions that can be used in Venice with a sandbox. If it is appropriate, the functions `load-file` and `load-resource` can be blacklisted in the sandbox.\n\n### References\n  * [PR](https://github.com/jlangch/venice/pull/4/commits/c942c73136333bc493050910f171a48e6f575b23)\n \n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [GitHub Venice](https://github.com/jlangch/venice)\n* Email us at [juerg.ch](mailto:juerg.ch@ggaweb.ch)\n\n### Credits\n\nI want to publicly recognize the contribution of [Jonathan Leitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh) for reporting this issue.",
