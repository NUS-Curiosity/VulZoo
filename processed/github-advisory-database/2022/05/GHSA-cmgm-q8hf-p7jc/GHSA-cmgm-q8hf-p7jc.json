  "summary": "XXE vulnerability in Jenkins Code Coverage API Plugin",
  "details": "Code Coverage API Plugin 1.1.4 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user able to control the input files for the \\\"Publish Coverage Report\\\" post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.\n\nCode Coverage API Plugin 1.1.5 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.",
