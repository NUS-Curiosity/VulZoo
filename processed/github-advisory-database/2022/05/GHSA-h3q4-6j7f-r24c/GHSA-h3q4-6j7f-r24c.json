  ],
  "summary": "priority vulnerable to denial of service",
  "details": "A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python priority library prior to version 1.2.0 could be targeted by a malicious peer by having that peer assign priority information for every possible HTTP/2 stream ID. The priority tree would happily continue to store the priority information for each stream, and would therefore allocate unbounded amounts of memory. Attempting to actually use a tree like this would also cause extremely high CPU usage to maintain the tree.",
