  "summary": "Jenkins Splunk Plugin Sandbox Bypass",
  "details": "Jenkins Splunk Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection. This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.\n\nThe affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.",
