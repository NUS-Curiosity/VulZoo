  "details": "## Withdrawn\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the CVE has been disputed and the underlying vulnerability is likely invalid. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n[According to maintainers of Fat Free CRM](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/pull/3599), the CRM comment feature allows certain HTML markup, but santizes the output when rendered to page. This allows safe tags (such as `<h1>` which the author tested and reported as a vulnerability) but correctly disallows `<script>` tags and other dangerous entities.\n\n## Original Description\nHTML Injection has been discovered in the v0.19.0 version of the Fat Free CRM product via an authenticated request to the /comments URI.",
