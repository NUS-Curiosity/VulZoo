  "summary": "Withdrawn Advisory: Node.js Inspector RCE via DNS Rebinding",
  "details": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because this vulnerability affects inspector code in https://github.com/nodejs/node, not the [legacy debugger](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector#legacy-debugger) at https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector. https://github.com/nodejs/node is not in a [supported ecosystem](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/README.md#supported-ecosystems).\n\n## Original Description\nThe Node.js inspector, in 6.x and later is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack which could be exploited to perform remote code execution. An attack is possible from malicious websites open in a web browser on the same computer, or another computer with network access to the computer running the Node.js process. A malicious website could use a DNS rebinding attack to trick the web browser to bypass same-origin-policy checks and to allow HTTP connections to localhost or to hosts on the local network. If a Node.js process with the debug port active is running on localhost or on a host on the local network, the malicious website could connect to it as a debugger, and get full code execution access.",
