The vulnerability in node-irc allows an attacker to manipulate a Matrix user into executing IRC commands by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message. The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.33.2. In terms of a workaround, users should refrain from replying to messages from untrusted participants in IRC-bridged Matrix rooms.
