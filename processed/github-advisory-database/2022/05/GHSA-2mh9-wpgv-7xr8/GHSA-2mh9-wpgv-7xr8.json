  "summary": "Jenkins Cloud Foundry Plugin vulnerable to exposure of sensitive information",
  "details": "\\Jenkins Cloud Foundry Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.\n\nThis form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer (for global configuration) or Item/Configure permissions (for job configuration).",
