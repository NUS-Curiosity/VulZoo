  "summary": "CSRF vulnerabilities in Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin",
  "details": "Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.12 and earlier does not require POST requests to request and apply changes, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.\n\nThese vulnerabilities allow attackers to create requests and/or have administrators apply pending requests, like renaming or deleting jobs, deleting builds, etc.\n\nJenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.13 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints. This was partially fixed in requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.8 to require POST requests for some of the affected HTTP endpoints, but the endpoint allowing administrators to apply pending requests remained unprotected until 2.2.13.",
