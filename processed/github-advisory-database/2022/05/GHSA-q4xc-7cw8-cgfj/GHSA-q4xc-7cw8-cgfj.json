  "summary": "dset vulnerable to prototype pollution",
  "details": "### Overview\nPrototype pollution vulnerability in 'dset' versions 1.0.0 through 2.0.1 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.\n\n### Details\nThe NPM module 'dset' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function â€˜export ()' did not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.\n\n### PoC\nThe export function accepts three arguments `obj, keys, val`. Due to the absence of validation, at values passed into `keys, val` arguments, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the `keys` value to include the `__proto__` property. Since there is no validation before assigning property to check whether the assigned `keys` is the Object's own property or not, the property `isAdmin` will be directly be assigned to the empty obj({}) thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `isAdmin` the valued would be substituted as \"true\" as it had been polluted.\n\n```js\nconst dset = require('dset');\nvar obj = {}\nconsole.log(\"Before : \" + obj.isAdmin);\ndset(obj, '__proto__.polluted', true);\nconsole.log(\"After : \" + obj.polluted);\n```\n",
