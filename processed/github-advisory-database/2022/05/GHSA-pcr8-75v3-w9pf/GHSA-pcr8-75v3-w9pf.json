This was fixed by adding support for walking those nodes.\n\nThis CVE ID is unique from CVE-2017-11836, CVE-2017-11837, CVE-2017-11838, CVE-2017-11839, CVE-2017-11840, CVE-2017-11841, CVE-2017-11843, CVE-2017-11846, CVE-2017-11858, CVE-2017-11859, CVE-2017-11861, CVE-2017-11866, CVE-2017-11869, CVE-2017-11870, CVE-2017-11871, and CVE-2017-11873.",
