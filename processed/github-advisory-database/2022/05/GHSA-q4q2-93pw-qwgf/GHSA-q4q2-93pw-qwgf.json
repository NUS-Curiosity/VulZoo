  "summary": "Issuer validation regression in Spring Cloud SSO Connector",
  "details": "Spring Cloud SSO Connector, version 2.1.2, contains a regression which disables issuer validation in resource servers that are not bound to the SSO service. In PCF deployments with multiple SSO service plans, a remote attacker can authenticate to unbound resource servers which use this version of the SSO Connector with tokens generated from another service plan.\n\n### Mitigation\nUsers of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:\n* Releases that have fixed this issue include:</p><ul><li>Spring Cloud SSO Connector: 2.1.3</li></ul>\n* Alternatively, you can perform <u>one</u> of the following workarounds:</p><ul><li>Bind your resource server to the SSO service plan via a service instance binding</li><li>Set “sso.connector.cloud.available=true” within your Spring application properties</li></ul>\n\n",
