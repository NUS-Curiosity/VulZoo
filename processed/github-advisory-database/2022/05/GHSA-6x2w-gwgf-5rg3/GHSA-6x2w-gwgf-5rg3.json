  "summary": "Jenkins Deploy WebLogic Plugin cross-site request forgery vulnerability",

This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to send an HTTP HEAD request to a user-specified URL, or confirm the existence of any file or directory on the Jenkins controller.\n\nAdditionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.",
