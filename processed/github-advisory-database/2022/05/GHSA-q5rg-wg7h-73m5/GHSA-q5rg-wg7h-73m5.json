  "summary": "LibreNMS Information Disclosure",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in LibreNMS through 1.47. The scripts that handle the graphing options (`html/includes/graphs/common.inc.php` and `html/includes/graphs/graphs.inc.php`) do not sufficiently validate or encode several fields of user supplied input. Some parameters are filtered with `mysqli_real_escape_string`, which is only useful for preventing SQL injection attacks; other parameters are unfiltered. This allows an attacker to inject RRDtool syntax with newline characters via the `html/graph.php` script. RRDtool syntax is quite versatile and an attacker could leverage this to perform a number of attacks, including disclosing directory structure and filenames, file content, denial of service, or writing arbitrary files.",
