  "summary": "Jenkins Static Analysis Utilities Plugin is vulnerable to Cross-site request forgery vulnerability",
  "details": "Jenkins analysis-core Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to display trend graphs for their static analysis results. analysis-core Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of each graph.\n\nThe configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.\n\nAdditionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.\n\nanalysis-core Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.",
