  "summary": "Malware in ctx",
  "details": "The `ctx` hosted project on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ctx/) was taken over via user account compromise and replaced with a malicious project which contained runtime code that collected the content of `os.environ.items()` when instantiating `Ctx` objects. The captured environment variables were sent as a base64 encoded query parameter to a heroku application running at `https://anti-theft-web.herokuapp.com`.\n\nIf you installed the package between May 14, 2022 and May 24, 2022, and your environment variables contain sensitive data like passwords and API keys (like `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`), we advise you to rotate your passwords and keys, then perform an audit to determine if they were exploited.",
