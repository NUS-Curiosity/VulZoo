  "summary": "deep-defaults vulnerable to prototype pollution",
  "details": "### Overview\nPrototype pollution vulnerability in 'deep-defaults' versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.5 allows attacker to cause a denial of service and may lead to remote code execution.\n\n### Details\nThe NPM module `deep-defaults` can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function `_deepDefaults()` does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.\n\n### PoC\nThe `_deepDefaults ()` function accepts `dest`, `src` as arguments. Due to the absence of validation on the values passed into the `src` argument, an attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the value to include the `__proto__` property. Since there is no validation before assigning the property to check whether the assigned argument is the Object's own property or not, the property `polluted` will be directly be assigned to the new object thereby polluting the Object prototype. Later in the code, if there is a check to validate `polluted` the valued would be substituted as \"Yes! Its Polluted\" as it had been polluted.\n\n```js\nvar deepDefaults = require(\"deep-defaults\")\nvar malicious_payload = '{\"__proto__\":{\"polluted\":\"Yes! Its Polluted\"}}';\nvar obj ={};\nconsole.log(\"Before : \" + {}.polluted);\ndeepDefaults(obj, JSON.parse(malicious_payload));\nconsole.log(\"After : \" + {}.polluted);\n```",
