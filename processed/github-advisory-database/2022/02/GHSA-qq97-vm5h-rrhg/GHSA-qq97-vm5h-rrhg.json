  "summary": "OCI Manifest Type Confusion Issue",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nSystems that rely on digest equivalence for image attestations may be vulnerable to type confusion.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to at least `v2.8.0-beta.1`  if you are running `v2.x` release. If you use the code from the `main` branch, update at least to the commit after [b59a6f827947f9e0e67df0cfb571046de4733586](https://github.com/distribution/distribution/commit/b59a6f827947f9e0e67df0cfb571046de4733586).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no way to work around this issue without patching.\n\n### References\n\nDue to [an oversight in the OCI Image Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/pull/411) that removed the embedded `mediaType` field from manifests, a maliciously crafted OCI Container Image can cause registry clients to parse the same image in two different ways without modifying the imageâ€™s digest by modifying the `Content-Type` header returned by a registry. This can invalidate a common pattern of relying on container image digests for equivalence.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [distribution](https://github.com/distribution/distribution) \n* Open an issue in [distribution-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec) \n* Email us at [cncf-distribution-security@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-distribution-security@lists.cncf.io)\n",
