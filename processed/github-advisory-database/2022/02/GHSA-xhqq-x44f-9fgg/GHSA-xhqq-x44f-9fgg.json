  "summary": "Authentication Bypass in github.com/russellhaering/gosaml2",
  "details": "### Impact\nGiven a valid SAML Response, it may be possible for an attacker to mutate the XML document in such a way that gosaml2 will trust a different portion of the document than was signed.\n\nDepending on the implementation of the Service Provider this enables a variety of attacks, including users accessing accounts other than the one to which they authenticated in the Identity Provider, or full authentication bypass.\n\n### Patches\nService Providers utilizing gosaml2 should upgrade to v0.6.0 or greater.",
