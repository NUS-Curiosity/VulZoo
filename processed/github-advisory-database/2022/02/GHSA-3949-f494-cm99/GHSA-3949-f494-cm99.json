  "summary": "Cross-site Scripting in Prism",
  "details": "### Impact\nPrism's [Command line plugin](https://prismjs.com/plugins/command-line/) can be used by attackers to achieve an XSS attack. The Command line plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text being inserted into the DOM as HTML code.\n\nServer-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the Command Line plugin are also not impacted.\n\n### Patches\nThis bug has been fixed in v1.27.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not use the Command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitized all code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use the Command line plugin.\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/3341",
