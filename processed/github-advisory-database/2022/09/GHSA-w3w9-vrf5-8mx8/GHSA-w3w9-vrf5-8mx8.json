  "summary": "ReactPHP's HTTP server parses encoded cookie names so malicious `__Host-` and `__Secure-` cookies can be sent",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIn ReactPHP's HTTP server component versions below v1.7.0, when ReactPHP is processing incoming HTTP cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead to cookies with prefixes like `__Host-` and `__Secure-` confused with cookies that decode to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being able to forge cookie which is supposed to be secure. See also CVE-2020-7070 and CVE-2020-8184 for more information. \n\n### Patches\n\n* https://github.com/reactphp/http/commit/663c9a3b77b71463fa7fcb76a6676ffd16979dd6 - Fixed in [reactphp/http `v1.7.0`](https://github.com/reactphp/http/releases/tag/v1.7.0)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nInfrastructure or DevOps can place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server to filter out any unexpected `Cookie` request headers.\n\n### References\n\n* CVE-2020-7070, https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=79699 and https://github.com/php/php-src/commit/6559fe912661ca5ce5f0eeeb591d928451428ed0\n* CVE-2020-8184, https://hackerone.com/reports/895727 and https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/1f5763de6a9fe515ff84992b343d63c88104654c\n* Originally introduced via https://github.com/reactphp/http/pull/175\n\n### Credits\n\n* Thanks to Marco Squarcina (TU Wien) for reporting this and working with us to coordinate this security advisory\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Join the discussion](https://github.com/orgs/reactphp/discussions/465)\n* Email us at support@reactphp.org\n",
