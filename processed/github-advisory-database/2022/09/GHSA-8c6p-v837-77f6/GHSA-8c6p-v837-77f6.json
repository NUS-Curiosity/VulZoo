  "summary": "Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating tag immutability policies",
  "details": "### Impact\nHarbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating tag immutability policies - API call:\n\n  PUT /projects/{project_name_or_id}/immutabletagrules/{immutable_rule_id}\n\nBy sending a request to update a tag immutability policy with an id that belongs to a\nproject that the currently authenticated user doesnâ€™t have access to, the attacker could\nmodify tag immutability policies configured in other projects.\n\n### Patches\nThis and similar issues are fixed in Harbor v2.5.2 and later. Please upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds available.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Harbor GitHub repository](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor)\n\n### Credits\nThanks to [Gal Goldstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gal-goldshtein/) and [Daniel Abeles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-abeles/) from [Oxeye Security](https://www.oxeye.io/) for reporting this issue.\n",
