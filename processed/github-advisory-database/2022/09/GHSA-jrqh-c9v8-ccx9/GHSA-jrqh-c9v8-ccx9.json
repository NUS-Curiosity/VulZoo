  "summary": "Path traversal in Jenkins build-publisher Plugin",
  "details": "Jenkins Build-Publisher Plugin 1.22 and earlier allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to create or replace any `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller file system by providing a crafted file name to an API endpoint. Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows attackers to replace any `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller file system with an empty file.\n\nThere is currently no known workaround or fix, and this plugin has been suspended.",
