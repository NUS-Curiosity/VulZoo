  "summary": "arr-pm vulnerable to arbitrary shell execution when extracting or listing files contained in a malicious rpm.",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nArbitrary shell execution is possible when using RPM::File#files and RPM::File#extract if the RPM contains a malicious \"payload compressor\" field.\n\nThis vulnerability impacts the `extract` and `files` methods of the `RPM::File` class in the affected versions of this library.\n\n### Patches\n\nVersion 0.0.12 is available with a fix for these issues.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhen using an affected version of this library (arr-pm), ensure any RPMs being processed contain valid/known payload compressor values. Such values include: gzip, bzip2, xz, zstd, and lzma.\n\nYou can check the payload compressor field in an rpm by using the rpm command line tool. For example:\n\n```\n% rpm -qp example-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm --qf \"%{PAYLOADCOMPRESSOR}\\n\"\ngzip\n```\n\n### Impact on known dependent projects\n\nThis library is used by [fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm). The vulnerability may impact fpm only when using the flag `-s rpm` or `--input-type rpm` to convert a malicious rpm to another format. It does not impact creating rpms.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/pull/14\n* https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/pull/15\n\n### Credit\n\nThanks to @joernchen for reporting this problem and contributing to the resolution :)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the arr-pm issue tracker](https://github.com/jordansissel/ruby-arr-pm/)\n\n",
