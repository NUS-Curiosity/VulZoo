  ],
  "summary": "SQL Injection in elide-datastore-aggregation",
  "details": "### Impact\nWhen leveraging the following together:\n\n- Elide Aggregation Data Store for Analytic Queries\n- Parameterized Columns (A column that requires a client provided parameter)\n- A parameterized column of type TEXT\n\nThere is the potential for a hacker to provide a carefully crafted query that would bypass server side authorization filters through SQL injection.  A recent patch to Elide 6.1.2 allowed the '-' character to be included in parameterized TEXT columns.  This character can be interpreted as SQL comments ('--') and allow the attacker to remove the WHERE clause from the generated query and bypass authorization filters.\n\n### Patches\nA [fix](https://github.com/yahoo/elide/pull/2581) is provided in [Elide 6.1.4](https://github.com/yahoo/elide/releases/tag/6.1.4).\n\n### Workarounds\nThe vulnerability only exists for parameterized columns of type TEXT and only for analytic queries (CRUD is not impacted).   Workarounds include leveraging a different type of parameterized column (TIME, MONEY, etc) or not leveraging parameterized columns.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [elide](https://github.com/yahoo/elide)\n* Contact us in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3vh8ac57cc)\n",
