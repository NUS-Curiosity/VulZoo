  "summary": "Out-of-bounds Write in zlib affects Nokogiri",
  "details": "## Summary\n\nNokogiri v1.13.4 updates the vendored zlib from 1.2.11 to 1.2.12, which addresses [CVE-2018-25032](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-25032). That CVE is scored as CVSS 7.4 \"High\" on the NVD record as of 2022-04-05.\n\nPlease note that this advisory only applies to the CRuby implementation of Nokogiri `< 1.13.4`, and only if the packaged version of `zlib` is being used. Please see [this document](https://nokogiri.org/LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.html#default-platform-release-ruby) for a complete description of which platform gems vendor `zlib`. If you've overridden defaults at installation time to use system libraries instead of packaged libraries, you should instead pay attention to your distro's `zlib` release announcements. \n\n## Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to Nokogiri `>= v1.13.4`.\n\n## Impact\n\n### [CVE-2018-25032](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-25032) in zlib\n\n- **Severity**: High\n- **Type**: [CWE-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html) Out of bounds write\n- **Description**: zlib before 1.2.12 allows memory corruption when deflating (i.e., when compressing) if the input has many distant matches.\n\n",
