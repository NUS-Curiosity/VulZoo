  "summary": "Improperly checked metadata on tools/armour itemstacks received from the client",
  "details": "### Impact\nDue to a workaround applied in 1.13, an attacker may send a negative damage/meta value in a tool or armour item's NBT, which `TypeConverter` then blindly uses as if it was valid without being checked.\n\nWhen this invalid metadata value reaches `Durable->setDamage()`, an exception is thrown because the metadata is not within the expected range for damage values.\n\nThis can be reproduced with either a too-large damage value, or a negative one.\n\n### Patches\nc8e1cfcbee4945fd4b63d2a7e96025c59744d4f1\n\n### Workarounds\nIn theory this can be checked by plugins using a custom `TypeConverter`, but this is likely to be very cumbersome.\n\n### For more information\n* Email us at [team@pmmp.io](mailto:team@pmmp.io)\n",
