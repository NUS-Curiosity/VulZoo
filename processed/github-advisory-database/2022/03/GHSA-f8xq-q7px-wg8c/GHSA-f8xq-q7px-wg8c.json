  "summary": "Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File in Gradio Flagging",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe `gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the user's computer.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which escapes the data saved to the csv with single quotes.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are using an older version of `gradio`, don't open csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar spreadsheet programs.\n\n",
