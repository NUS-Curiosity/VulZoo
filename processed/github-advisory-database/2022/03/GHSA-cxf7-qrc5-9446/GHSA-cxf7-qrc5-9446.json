  "summary": "Remote shell execution vulnerability in image_processing",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using the `#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations that are coming from unsanitized user input, this allows the attacker to execute shell commands:\n\n```rb\nImageProcessing::Vips.apply({ system: \"echo EXECUTED\" })\n#>> EXECUTED\n```\n\nThis method is called internally by Active Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you're processing based on user input, it's highly recommended that you always sanitize the user input, by allowing only a constrained set of operations. For example:\n\n```rb\noperations = params[:operations]\n  .map { |operation| [operation[:name], *operation[:value]] }\n  .select { |name, *| name.to_s.include? %w[resize_to_limit strip ...] } # sanitization\n\nImageProcessing::Vips.apply(operations)\n```",
