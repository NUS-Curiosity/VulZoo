  "details": "### Impact\nUsers of MySQL, MariaDB, PgSQL and SQLite are affected. XSS is in most cases prevented by strict CSP in all modern browsers. The only exception is when Adminer is using a `pdo_` extension to communicate with the database (it is used if the native extensions are not enabled). In browsers without CSP, Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 are affected.\n\n### Patches\nPatched by 4043092, included in version [4.8.1](https://github.com/vrana/adminer/releases/tag/v4.8.1).\n\n### Workarounds\nDo both:\n* Use browser supporting strict CSP.\n* Enable the native PHP extensions (e.g. `mysqli`) or disable displaying PHP errors (`display_errors`).\n\n### References\nhttps://sourceforge.net/p/adminer/bugs-and-features/797/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Comment at 4043092.\n",
