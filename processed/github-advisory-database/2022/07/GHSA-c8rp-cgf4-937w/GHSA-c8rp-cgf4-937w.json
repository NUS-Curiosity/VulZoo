  "summary": "mezzio-swoole Applications Using Diactoros Vulnerable to HTTP Host Header Attack",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nmezzio-swoole applications using Diactoros for their PSR-7 implementation, and which are either not behind a proxy, or can be accessed via untrusted proxies, can potentially have the host, protocol, and/or port of a `Laminas\\Diactoros\\Uri` instance associated with the incoming server request modified to reflect values from `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Such changes can potentially lead to XSS attacks (if a fully-qualified URL is used in links) and/or URL poisoning.\n\n### Patches\n\n3.7.0, and 4.3.0 and later.\n\nThe patches present in these versions update the `SwooleServerRequestFactory` to filter out `X-Forwarded-*` headers when creating the initial request. They then by default pass that instance through a `Laminas\\Diactoros\\ServerRequestFilter\\FilterUsingXForwardedHeaders` instance created from the `trustReservedSubnet()` constructor, ensuring that the request only honors the `X-Forwarded-*` headers for private reserved subnets.\n\nUsers can define the `Laminas\\Diactoros\\ServerRequestFilter\\FilterServerRequestInterface` service if they wish to provide a different implementation, or configure the `FilterUsingXForwardedHeaders` instance differently. When defined, that instance will be used to filter the generated request instance.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nInfrastructure or DevOps can place a trusted reverse proxy in front of the mezzio-swoole server.\n\n### References\n\n- [HTTP Host Header Attacks](https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open an issue in [mezzio/mezzio-swoole](https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio-swoole/)\n- [Email us](mailto:security@getlaminas.org)",
