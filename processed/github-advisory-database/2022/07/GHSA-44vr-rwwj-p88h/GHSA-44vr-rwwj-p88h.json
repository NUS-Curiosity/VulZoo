  ],
  "summary": "Shescape vulnerable to insufficient escaping of whitespace",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThis only impacts users that use the `escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`. Example:\n\n```javascript\nimport cp from \"node:child_process\";\nimport * as shescape from \"shescape\";\n\n// 1. Prerequisites\nconst options = {\n  shell: \"bash\",\n  // Or\n  shell: \"dash\",\n  // Or\n  shell: \"powershell.exe\",\n  // Or\n  shell: \"zsh\",\n  // Or\n  shell: undefined, // Only if the default shell is one of the affected shells.\n};\n\n// 2. Attack (one of multiple)\nconst payload = \"foo #bar\";\n\n// 3. Usage\nlet escapedPayload;\nshescape.escape(payload, { interpolation: true });\n// Or\nshescape.escapeAll(payload, { interpolation: true });\n\ncp.execSync(`echo Hello ${escapedPayload}!`, options);\n// _Output depends on the shell being used_\n```\n\nThe result is that if an attacker is able to include whitespace in their input they can:\n\n1. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted directly after whitespace.\n   - Affected shells: _Bash_, _Dash_, _Zsh_, _PowerShell_\n2. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific special characters inserted or appearing after line terminating characters. \n   - Affected shells: _Bash_\n3. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a line feed character.\n   - Affected Shells: _Bash_, _Dash_, _Zsh_, _PowerShell_\n3. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a carriage return character.\n   - Affected Shells: _PowerShell_\n\n### Patches\n\nBehaviour number 1 has been patched in [v1.5.7] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.\n\nBehaviour number 2, 3, and 4 have been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe best workaround is to avoid having to use the `interpolation: true` option - in most cases using an alternative is possible, see [the recipes](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape#recipes) for recommendations.\n\nAlternatively, you can strip all whitespace from user input. Note that this is error prone, for example: for PowerShell this requires stripping `'\\u0085'` which is not included in JavaScript's definition of `\\s` for Regular Expressions.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/322\n- https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/324\n- https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/332\n- https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.7\n- https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.8\n\n### For more information\n\n- Comment on:\n  - For behaviour 1 (PowerShell): https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/322\n  - For behaviour 1 (Bash, Dash, Zsh): https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/324\n  - For behaviour 2, 3, 4 (_any shell_): https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/332\n- Open an issue at https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/issues (_New issue_ > _Question_ > _Get started_)\n- If you're missing CMD from this advisory, see https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/security/advisories/GHSA-jjc5-fp7p-6f8w\n\n[v1.5.7]: https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.7\n[v1.5.8]: https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.5.8\n\n",
