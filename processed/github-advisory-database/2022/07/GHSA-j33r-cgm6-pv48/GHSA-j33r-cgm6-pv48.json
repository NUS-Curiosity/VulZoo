  "summary": "Missing Authorization in Jenkins Recipe Plugin",
  "details": "Missing permission checks in Jenkins Recipe Plugin 1.2 and earlier allow attackers with Overall/Read permission to send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.\n\nAdditionally, the plugin allows users to export the full configuration of jobs as part of a recipe, granting access to job configuration XML data to every user with Item/Read permission. The encrypted values of secrets stored in the job configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the config.xml API for users without Item/Configure permission.",
