  "summary": "undici before v5.8.0 vulnerable to uncleared cookies on cross-host / cross-origin redirect",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAuthorization headers are already cleared on cross-origin redirect in\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/main/lib/handler/redirect.js#L189, based on https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/872.\n\nHowever, cookie headers which are sensitive headers and are official headers found in the spec, remain uncleared. There also has been active discussion of implementing a cookie store https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/1441, which suggests that there are active users using cookie headers in undici.\nAs such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a 3rd-party site or a malicious attacker who can control the redirection target (ie. an open redirector) to leak the cookie to the 3rd party site.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis was patched in v5.8.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nBy default, this vulnerability is not exploitable.\nDo not enable redirections, i.e. `maxRedirections: 0` (the default). \n\n### References\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/1635514\nhttps://curl.se/docs/CVE-2018-1000007.html\nhttps://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [undici repository](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues)\n* To make a report, follow the [SECURITY](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/SECURITY.md) document\n",
