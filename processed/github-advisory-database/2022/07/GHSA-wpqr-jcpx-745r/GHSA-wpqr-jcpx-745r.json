  "summary": "Incorrect handling of invalid surrogate pair characters",
  "details": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nAnyone parsing JSON from an untrusted source is vulnerable.\n\nJSON strings that contain escaped surrogate characters not part of a proper surrogate pair were decoded incorrectly. Besides corrupting strings, this allowed for potential key confusion and value overwriting in dictionaries.\n\nExamples:\n\n```python\n# An unpaired high surrogate character is ignored.\n>>> ujson.loads(r'\"\\uD800\"')\n''\n>>> ujson.loads(r'\"\\uD800hello\"')\n'hello'\n\n# An unpaired low surrogate character is preserved.\n>>> ujson.loads(r'\"\\uDC00\"')\n'\\udc00'\n\n# A pair of surrogates with additional non surrogate characters pair up in spite of being invalid.\n>>> ujson.loads(r'\"\\uD800foo bar\\uDC00\"')\n'foo bar𐀀'\n```\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nUsers should upgrade to UltraJSON 5.4.0.\n\nFrom version 5.4.0, UltraJSON decodes lone surrogates in the same way as the standard library's `json` module does, preserving them in the parsed output:\n\n```python3\n>>> ujson.loads(r'\"\\uD800\"')\n'\\ud800'\n>>> ujson.loads(r'\"\\uD800hello\"')\n'\\ud800hello'\n>>> ujson.loads(r'\"\\uDC00\"')\n'\\udc00'\n>>> ujson.loads(r'\"\\uD800foo bar\\uDC00\"')\n'\\ud800foo bar\\udc00'\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nShort of switching to an entirely different JSON library, there are no safe alternatives to upgrading.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [UltraJSON](http://github.com/ultrajson/ultrajson/issues)\n",
