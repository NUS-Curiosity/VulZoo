  "summary": "Sensitive query parameters logged by default in OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation http and AspNetCore",
  "details": "## Impact\n\n`OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` writes the `url.full` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for outgoing http requests and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` writes the `url.query` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for incoming http requests.\n\nThese attributes are defined by the [Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-spans.md).\n\nUp until the `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This may lead to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information, credentials, etc.) being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s) being instrumented) which could cause privacy and/or security incidents.\n\nNote: Older versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` may use different tag names but have the same vulnerability.\n\n## Resolution\n\nThe `1.8.1` versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will now redact by default all values detected on transmitted or received query strings.\n\nExample transmitted or received query sting:\n\n`?key1=value1&key2=value2`\n\nExample of redacted value written on telemetry:\n\n`?key1=Redacted&key2=Redacted`",
