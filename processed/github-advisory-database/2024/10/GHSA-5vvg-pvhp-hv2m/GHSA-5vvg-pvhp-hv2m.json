  "summary": "The Snowflake Connector for Python stores sensitive data in logs",
  "details": "### Issue\nSnowflake recently learned about and remediated a set of vulnerabilities in the Snowflake Connector for Python. Under specific conditions, certain users credentials (or portions of those credentials) were logged locally by the Connector to the users own systems. The credentials were not logged by Snowflake.\n\nThese vulnerabilities affect versions up to and including 3.12.2. Snowflake fixed the issue in version 3.12.3.\n\n### Vulnerability Details\nWhen the logging level was set by the user to DEBUG, the Connector could have logged Duo passcodes (when specified via the “passcode” parameter) and Azure SAS tokens. Additionally, the [SecretDetector](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-example#logging) logging formatter, if enabled, contained bugs which caused it to not fully redact JWT tokens and certain private key formats.\n\n### Solution\nSnowflake released version 3.12.3 of the Snowflake Connector for Python, which fixes these issues. We recommend users upgrade to version 3.12.3 and review their logs for any potentially sensitive information that may have been captured.\n\n### Additional Information\nIf you discover a security vulnerability in one of our products or websites, please report the issue to HackerOne.
