  "summary": "cookie accepts cookie name, path, and domain with out of bounds characters",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe cookie name could be used to set other fields of the cookie, resulting in an unexpected cookie value. For example, `serialize(\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a\", value)` would result in `\"userName=<script>alert('XSS3')</script>; Max-Age=2592000; a=test\"`, setting `userName` cookie to `<script>` and ignoring `value`.\n\nA similar escape can be used for `path` and `domain`, which could be abused to alter other fields of the cookie.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to 0.7.0, which updates the validation for `name`, `path`, and `domain`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAvoid passing untrusted or arbitrary values for these fields, ensure they are set by the application instead of user input.\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/jshttp/cookie/pull/167",
