  "summary": "Gradio's dropdown component pre-process step does not limit the values to those in the dropdown list",
  "details": "### Impact\n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability is a **data validation issue** in the Gradio `Dropdown` component's pre-processing step. Even if the `allow_custom_value` parameter is set to `False`, attackers can bypass this restriction by sending custom requests with arbitrary values, effectively breaking the developerâ€™s intended input constraints. While this alone is not a severe vulnerability, it can lead to more critical security issues, particularly when paired with other vulnerabilities like file downloads from the user's machine.\n\n### Patches\nYes, this issue is addressed in `gradio>=5.0`. Please upgrade to the latest version to resolve the problem.\n\n### Workarounds  \n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nTo mitigate the issue without upgrading, developers can add manual validation in their prediction function to check the received values against the allowed dropdown values before processing them.",
