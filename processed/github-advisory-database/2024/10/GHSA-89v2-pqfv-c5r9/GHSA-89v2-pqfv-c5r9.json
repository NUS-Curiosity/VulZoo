  "summary": "Gradio's CORS origin validation accepts the null origin",
  "details": "### Impact\n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability relates to **CORS origin validation accepting a null origin**. When a Gradio server is deployed locally, the `localhost_aliases` variable includes \"null\" as a valid origin. This allows attackers to make unauthorized requests from sandboxed iframes or other sources with a null origin, potentially leading to data theft, such as user authentication tokens or uploaded files. This impacts users running Gradio locally, especially those using basic authentication.\n\n### Patches\nYes, please upgrade to `gradio>=5.0` to address this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nAs a workaround, users can manually modify the `localhost_aliases` list in their local Gradio deployment to exclude \"null\" as a valid origin. By removing this value, the Gradio server will no longer accept requests from sandboxed iframes or sources with a null origin, mitigating the potential for exploitation.",
