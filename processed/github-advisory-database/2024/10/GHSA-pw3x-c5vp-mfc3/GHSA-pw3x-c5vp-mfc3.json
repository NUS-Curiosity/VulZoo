  "summary": "OpenRefine has a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) in GData extension (authorized.vt)",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nThe `/extension/gdata/authorized` endpoint includes the `state` GET parameter verbatim in a `<script>` tag in the output, so without escaping.\n\nAn attacker could lead or redirect a user to a crafted URL containing JavaScript code, which would then cause that code to be executed in the victim's browser as if it was part of OpenRefine.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `state` GET parameter is read from:\n\n* extensions/gdata/module/MOD-INF/controller.js:105\n\nIt is used (as `$state`) in:\n\n* extensions/gdata/module/authorized.vt:43\n\nThere is no check that the state has the expected format (base64-encoded JSON with values like \"openrefine123...\" and \"cb123...\"), or that the page was indeed opened as part of the authorization flow.\n\n### PoC\n\nNavigate to:\n\n    http://localhost:3333/extension/gdata/authorized?state=%22,alert(1),%22&error=\n\nAn alert box pops up.\n\nThe gdata extension needs to be present. No other configuration is needed; specifically, it is not required to have a client ID or client secret set.\n\n### Impact\n\nExecution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser. The attacker-provided code can do anything the user can do, including deleting projects, retrieving database passwords, or executing arbitrary Jython or Closure expressions, if those extensions are also present.",
