  "summary": "Incorrect delegation lookups can make go-tuf download the wrong artifact",
  "details": "During the ongoing work on the TUF conformance test suite, we have come across a test that reveals what we believe is a bug in go-tuf with security implications. The bug exists in go-tuf delegation tracing and could result in downloading the wrong artifact. \n\nWe have come across this issue in the test in this PR: https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf-conformance/pull/115.\n\nThe test - `test_graph_traversal` - sets up a repository with a series of delegations, invokes the clients `refresh()` and then checks the order in which the client traced the delegations. The test shows that the go-tuf client inconsistently traces the delegations in a wrong way. For example, [during one CI run](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf-conformance/pull/115#issuecomment-2275625542), the `two-level-delegations` test case triggered a wrong order. The delegations in this look as such:\n\n```python\n\"two-level-delegations\": DelegationsTestCase(\n        delegations=[\n            DelegationTester(\"targets\", \"A\"),\n            DelegationTester(\"targets\", \"B\"),\n            DelegationTester(\"B\", \"C\"),\n        ],\n        visited_order=[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"],\n    ),\n```\n\nHere, `targets` delegate to `\"A\"`, and to `\"B\"`, and `\"B\"` delegates to `\"C\"`. The client should trace the delegations in the order `\"A\"` then `\"B\"` then `\"C\"` but in this particular CI run, go-tuf traced the delegations `\"B\"->\"C\"->\"A\"`.\n\nIn a subsequent CI run, this test case did not fail, but [another one did](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf-conformance/pull/115#issuecomment-2275640487).\n\n@jku has done a bit of debugging and believes that the returned map of `GetRolesForTarget` returns a map that causes this behavior:\n\nhttps://github.com/theupdateframework/go-tuf/blob/f95222bdd22d2ac4e5b8ed6fe912b645e213c3b5/metadata/metadata.go#L565-L580\n\nWe believe that this map should be an ordered list instead of a map.",
