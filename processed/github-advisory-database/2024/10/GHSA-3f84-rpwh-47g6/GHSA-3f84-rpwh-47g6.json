  "summary": "Waitress vulnerable to DoS leading to high CPU usage/resource exhaustion",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen a remote client closes the connection before waitress has had the opportunity to call `getpeername()` waitress won't correctly clean up the connection leading to the main thread attempting to write to a socket that no longer exists, but not removing it from the list of sockets to attempt to process. This leads to a busy-loop calling the write function.\n\nA remote attacker could run waitress out of available sockets with very little resources required.\n\n### Patches\n\nWaitress 3.0.1 contains fixes that remove the race condition.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo work-around.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/issues/418\n- https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/pull/435\n",
