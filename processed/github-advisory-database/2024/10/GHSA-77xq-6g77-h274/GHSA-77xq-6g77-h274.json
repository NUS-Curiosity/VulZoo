  "summary": "Gradio's `is_in_or_equal` function may be bypassed",
  "details": "### Impact\n**What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?**\n\nThis vulnerability relates to the **bypass of directory traversal checks** within the `is_in_or_equal` function. This function, intended to check if a file resides within a given directory, can be bypassed with certain payloads that manipulate file paths using `..` (parent directory) sequences. Attackers could potentially access restricted files if they are able to exploit this flaw, although the difficulty is high. This primarily impacts users relying on Gradioâ€™s blocklist or directory access validation, particularly when handling file uploads.\n\n### Patches\nYes, please upgrade to `gradio>=5.0` to address this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n**Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?**\n\nAs a workaround, users can manually sanitize and normalize file paths in their Gradio deployment before passing them to the `is_in_or_equal` function. Ensuring that all file paths are properly resolved and absolute can help mitigate the bypass vulnerabilities caused by the improper handling of `..` sequences or malformed paths.",
