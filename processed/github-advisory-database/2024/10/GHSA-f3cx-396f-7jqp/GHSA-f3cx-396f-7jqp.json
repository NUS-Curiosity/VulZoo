  "summary": "Livewire Remote Code Execution on File Uploads",
  "details": "In livewire/livewire prior to `v2.12.7` and `v3.5.2`, the file extension of an uploaded file is guessed based on the MIME type. As a result, the actual file extension from the file name is not validated. An attacker can therefore bypass the validation by uploading a file with a valid MIME type (e.g., `image/png`) and a “.php” file extension.\nIf the following criteria are met, the attacker can carry out an RCE attack:\n\n- Filename is composed of the original file name using `$file->getClientOriginalName()`\n- Files stored directly on your server in a public storage disk\n- Webserver is configured to execute “.php” files\n\n### PoC\nIn the following scenario, an attacker could upload a file called `shell.php` with an `image/png` MIME type and execute it on the remote server.\n```php\nclass SomeComponent extends Component\n{\n    use WithFileUploads;\n\n    #[Validate('image|extensions:png')]\n    public $file;\n\n    public function save()\n    {\n        $this->validate();\n\n        $this->file->storeAs(\n            path: 'images',\n            name: $this->file->getClientOriginalName(),\n            options: ['disk' => 'public'],\n        );\n    }\n}\n```\n\n",
