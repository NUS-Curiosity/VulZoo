  "summary": "async-graphql Directive Overload",
  "details": "### Impact\n\n- Service Disruption: The server may become unresponsive or extremely slow, potentially leading to downtime.\n- Resource Exhaustion: Excessive use of server resources, such as CPU and memory, could negatively impact other services running on the same infrastructure.\n- User Experience Degradation: Users may experience delays or failures when accessing the service, which could lead to frustration and loss of trust in the service.\n\n### Patches\n\n1. Upgrade to v7.0.10\n2. Use [SchemaBuilder.limit_directives](https://docs.rs/async-graphql/latest/async_graphql/struct.SchemaBuilder.html#method.limit_directives) to limit the maximum number of directives for a single field.\n",
