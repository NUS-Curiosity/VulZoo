This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nNVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.16.1 or earlier contains a Time-of-check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability when used with default configuration where a specifically crafted container image may gain access to the host file system. This does not impact use cases where CDI is used. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering.",
