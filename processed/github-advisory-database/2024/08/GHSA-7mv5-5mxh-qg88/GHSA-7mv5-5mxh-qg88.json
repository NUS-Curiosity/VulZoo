  "summary": "nanopb vulnerable to invalid free() call with oneofs and PB_ENABLE_MALLOC",
  "details": "### Impact\nDecoding a specifically formed message can cause invalid `free()` or `realloc()` calls if the message type contains an `oneof` field, and the `oneof` directly contains both a pointer field and a non-pointer field. If the message data first contains the non-pointer field and then the pointer field, the data of the non-pointer field is incorrectly treated as if it was a pointer value. Such message data rarely occurs in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed.\n\n### Patches\nPreliminary patch is available on git for [0.4.x](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/commit/e2f0ccf939d9f82931d085acb6df8e9a182a4261) and [0.3.x](https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/commit/4a375a560651a86726e5283be85a9231fd0efe9c) branches. The fix will be released in versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5 once testing has been completed.\n\n### Workarounds\nFollowing workarounds are available:\n* Set the option `no_unions` for the oneof field. This will generate fields as separate instead of C union, and avoids triggering the problematic code.\n* Set the type of all fields inside the oneof to `FT_POINTER`. This ensures that the data contained inside the `union` is always a valid pointer.\n* Heap implementations that guard against invalid `free()` provide a partial mitigation. Depending on the message type, the pointer value may be attacker controlled and can be used to bypass heap protections.\n\n### References\nBug report: https://github.com/nanopb/nanopb/issues/647\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, comment on the bug report linked above.",
