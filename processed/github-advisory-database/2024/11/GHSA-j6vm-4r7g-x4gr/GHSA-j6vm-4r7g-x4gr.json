  "summary": "Devolutions.XTS.NET Vulnerable to Timing Attack on GF Multiplications",
  "details": "### Impact\nTiming attacks on Galois Field multiplications in this package. Successful exploitation would effectively allow a downgrade of the security guarantees of the XTS mode to the security guarantees of ECB mode, allowing block swapping, enabling identification of identical blocks, and rendering half of the XTS key obsolete. Timing attacks require specific conditions to be exploitable.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in 2024.11.26\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade the package\n\n### References\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack\n",
