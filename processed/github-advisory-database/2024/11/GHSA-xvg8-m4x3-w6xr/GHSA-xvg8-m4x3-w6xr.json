  "summary": "matrix-js-sdk has insufficient MXC URI validation which allows client-side path traversal",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nmatrix-js-sdk before 34.11.0 is vulnerable to client-side path traversal via crafted MXC URIs. A malicious room member can trigger clients based on the matrix-js-sdk to issue arbitrary authenticated GET requests to the client's homeserver.\n\n### Details\n\nThe Matrix specification demands homeservers to [perform validation](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.12/client-server-api/#security-considerations-5) of the `server-name` and `media-id` components of MXC URIs with the intent to prevent path traversal. However, it is not mentioned that a similar check must also be performed on the client to prevent *client-side* path traversal. matrix-js-sdk fails to perform this validation.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in matrix-js-sdk 34.11.1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone.\n\n### References\n\n- https://spec.matrix.org/v1.12/client-server-api/#security-considerations-5\n- https://blog.doyensec.com/2024/07/02/cspt2csrf.html\n",
