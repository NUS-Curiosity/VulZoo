  "summary": "XStream is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack due to stack overflow from a manipulated binary input stream",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream when XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver.\n\n### Patches\nXStream 1.4.21 detects the manipulation in the binary input stream causing the the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream if XStream is configured to use the BinaryStreamDriver.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2024-47072](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2024-47072.html).\n\n### Credits\nAlexis Challande of Trail Of Bits found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.",
