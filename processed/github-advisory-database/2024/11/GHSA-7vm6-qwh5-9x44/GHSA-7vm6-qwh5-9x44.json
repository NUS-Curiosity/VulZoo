  "summary": "loona-hpack Panic Vulnerability",
  "details": "### Summary\n`loona-hpack` suffers from the same vulnerability as the original `hpack` as documented in https://github.com/mlalic/hpack-rs/issues/11 \n\n### Details\nThe original includes a very nice description of the problem, as well as an easy-enough fix for it.\n\n### PoC\nThe original example pretty much still applies:\n```rust\nuse loona_hpack::Decoder;\n\npub fn main() {\n    let input = &[0x3f];\n    let mut decoder = Decoder::new();\n    let _ = decoder.decode(input);\n}\n```\n\n### Impact\nFrom the original:\n`All users who try to decode untrusted input using the Decoder are vulnerable to this exploit. A patched version of the crate is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/hpack-patched) under the name hpack-patched. See [Cargo's documentation on overriding dependencies](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html) for more information.`\n",
