  "summary": "OctoPrint has API key access in settings without reauthentication",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nOctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.2 contain a vulnerability that allows an attacker that has gained temporary control over an authenticated victim's OctoPrint browser session to retrieve/recreate/delete the user's or - if the victim has admin permissions - the global API key without having to reauthenticate by re-entering the user account's password. \n\nAn attacker could use a stolen API key to access OctoPrint through its API, or disrupt workflows depending on the API key they deleted.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability will be patched in version 1.10.3.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to OctoPrint by Jacopo Tediosi.",
