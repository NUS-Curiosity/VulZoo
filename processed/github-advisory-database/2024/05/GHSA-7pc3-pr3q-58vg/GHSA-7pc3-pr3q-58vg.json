  "summary": "sagemaker-python-sdk Command Injection vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils` module before version 2.214.3 allows for potentially unsafe Operating System (OS) Command Injection if inappropriate command is passed as the “requirements_path” parameter. This consequently may allow an unprivileged third party to cause remote code execution, denial of service, affecting both confidentiality and integrity.\n\nImpacted versions: <2.214.3\n\n### Credit\n\nWe would like to thank HiddenLayer for collaborating on this issue through the coordinated vulnerability disclosure process.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDo not override the “requirements_path” parameter of capture_dependencies function in `sagemaker.serve.save_retrive.version_1_0_0.save.utils`, instead use the default value.\n\n### References\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory we ask that you contact AWS/Amazon Security via our vulnerability reporting page [1] or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.\n[1] Vulnerability reporting page: https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting\n\nFixed by: https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/pull/4556",
