  "summary": "silverstripe/framework code execution vulnerability",
  "details": "There is a vulnerability whereby arbitrary global functions may be executed if malicious user input is passed through to in the second argument of `ViewableData::renderWith`. This argument resolves associative arrays as template placeholders. This exploit requires that user code has been written which makes use of the second argument in `renderWith` and where user input is passed directly as a value in an associative array without sanitisation such as `Convert::raw2xml()`.\n\n`ViewableData::customise` is not vulnerable.",
