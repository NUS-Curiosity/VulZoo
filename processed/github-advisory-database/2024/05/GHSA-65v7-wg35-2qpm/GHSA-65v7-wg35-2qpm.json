  "details": "Sylius 1.0.0 to 1.0.16, 1.1.0 to 1.1.8, 1.2.0 to 1.2.1 versions of AdminBundle and ResourceBundle are affected by this security issue.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in Sylius 1.0.17, 1.1.9 and 1.2.2. Development branch for 1.3 release has also been fixed.\n\n### Description\n\nThe following actions in the admin panel did not require a CSRF token:\n\n- marking order’s payment as completed\n- marking order’s payment as refunded\n- marking product review as accepted\n- marking product review as rejected\n\n### Resolution\n\nThe issue is fixed by adding a required CSRF token to those actions.\n\nWe also fixed `ResourceController`‘s  `applyStateMachineTransitionAction` method by adding a CSRF token check. If you use that action in the API context, you can disable it by adding `csrf_protection:` false to its routing configuration",
