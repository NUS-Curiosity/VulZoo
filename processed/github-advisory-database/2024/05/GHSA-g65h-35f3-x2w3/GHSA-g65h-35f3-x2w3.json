  "summary": "Directus Lacks Session Tokens Invalidation",
  "details": "### Summary\nCurrently session tokens function like the other JWT tokens where they are not actually invalidated when logging out. The `directus_session` gets destroyed and the cookie gets deleted but if you captured the cookie value it will still work for the entire expiry time which is set to 1 day by default. Making it effectively a long lived unrevokable stateless token instead of the stateful session token it was meant to be.\nWhen authenticating a session token JWT, Directus should also check whether the associated `directus_session` both still exists and has not expired (although the token should expire at the same time or before the session) to ensure leaked tokens are not valid indefinitely.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n- Copy the current session token from the cookie\n- Refresh and or log out\n- Use the saved session token to check if it is still valid\n\n### Impact\nThe lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Incorrect token invalidation could allow an attacker to use the browser's history to access a Directus instance session previously accessed by the victim.",
