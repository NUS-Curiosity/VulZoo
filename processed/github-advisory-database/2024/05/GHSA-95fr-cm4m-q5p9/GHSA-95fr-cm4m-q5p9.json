It still simply discloses that an\n    object by a specific name exists or not without even having\n    enough permissions.\n```\n\nUsers must upgrade to RELEASE.2024-05-27T19-17-46Z for the fix\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds.\n\n### References\nRefer to the pull request #19810 for more information on the fix.",
