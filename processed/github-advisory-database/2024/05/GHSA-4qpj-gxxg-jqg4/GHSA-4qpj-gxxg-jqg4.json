  "summary": "Swiftmailer Sendmail transport arbitrary shell execution",
  "details": "Prior to 5.2.1, the sendmail transport (`Swift_Transport_SendmailTransport`) was vulnerable to an arbitrary shell execution if the \"From\" header came from a non-trusted source and no \"Return-Path\" is configured. This has been fixed in 5.2.1. If you are using sendmail as a transport, you are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.",
