  "summary": "static-web-server vulnerable to stored Cross-site Scripting in directory listings via file names",
  "details": "### Summary\nIf directory listings are enabled for a directory that an untrusted user has upload privileges for, a malicious file name like `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.txt` will allow JavaScript code execution in the context of the web serverâ€™s domain.\n\n### Details\nSWS generally does not perform escaping of HTML entities on any values inserted in the directory listing. At the very least `file_name` and `current_path` could contain malicious data however. `file_uri` could also be malicious but the relevant scenarios seem to be all caught by hyper.\n\n### Impact\nFor any web server that allow users to upload files or create directories under a name of their choosing this becomes a stored XSS vulnerability.",
