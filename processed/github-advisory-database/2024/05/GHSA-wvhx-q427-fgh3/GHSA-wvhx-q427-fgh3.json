  "summary": "Arbitrary HTML present after sanitization because of unicode normalization",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIf using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSet `keep_typographic_whitespace=True` explicitly, or normalize to NFKC yourself earlier.\n",
