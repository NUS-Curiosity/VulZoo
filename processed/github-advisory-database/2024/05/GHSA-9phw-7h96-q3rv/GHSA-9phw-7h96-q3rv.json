  "details": "In versions prior to 3.26.0 and prior to 4.11.0 of the \"scheb/two-factor-bundle\" project, a security vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) using the remember_me cookie. When the remember_me checkbox was used during login, a \"REMEMBERME\" cookie was created. Upon redirection to the 2FA page, attackers could manipulate the SESSIONID key, granting access to the homepage \"/\" and gaining authentication without completing 2FA.",
