  "summary": "Apache StreamPark: maven build params could trigger remote command execution",
  "details": "In streampark, the project module integrates Maven's compilation capabilities. The input parameter validation is not strict, allowing attackers to insert commands for remote command execution, The prerequisite for a successful attack is that the user needs to log in to the streampark system and have system-level permissions. Generally, only users of that system have the authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this vulnerability is very low.\n\nMitigation:\n\nall users should upgrade to 2.1.4\n\nBackground info:\n\nLog in to Streampark using the default username (e.g. test1, test2, test3) and the default password (streampark). Navigate to the Project module, then add a new project. Enter the git repository address of the project and input `touch /tmp/success_2.1.2` as the \"Build Argument\". Note that there is no verification and interception of the special character \"`\". As a result, you will find that this injection command will be successfully executed after executing the build.\n\nIn the latest version, the special symbol ` is intercepted.",
