  ],
  "summary": "Ibexa Admin UI vulnerable to DOM-based Cross-site Scripting in file upload widget",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe file upload widget is vulnerable to XSS payloads in filenames. Access permission to upload files is required. As such, in most cases only authenticated editors and administrators will have the required permission. It is not persistent, i.e. the payload is only executed during the upload. In effect, an attacker will have to trick an editor/administrator into uploading a strangely named file. The fix ensures XSS is escaped.\n\n### Patches\nSee \"Patched versions\". Commit: https://github.com/ibexa/admin-ui/commit/8dc413fad1045fcfbe65dbcb0bea8516accc4c3e\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n- https://developers.ibexa.co/security-advisories/ibexa-sa-2024-004-dom-based-xss-in-file-upload\n- https://github.com/ibexa/admin-ui/commit/8dc413fad1045fcfbe65dbcb0bea8516accc4c3e\n- https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-admin-ui/security/advisories/GHSA-gc5h-6jx9-q2qh\n\n### Credit\nThis vulnerability was discovered and reported to Ibexa by Alec Romano: https://github.com/4rdr\nWe thank them for reporting it responsibly to us.\n\nHow to report security issues:\nhttps://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/infrastructure_and_maintenance/security/reporting_issues/",
