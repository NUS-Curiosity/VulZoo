  "summary": "Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Privacy Center of SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL",
  "details": "`SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is a server-side configuration environment variable used by the Fides Privacy Center to communicate with the Fides webserver backend. The value of this variable is a URL which typically includes a private IP address, private domain name, and/or port.\n\nThis vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to make a HTTP GET request from the Privacy Center that discloses the value of this server-side URL.\n\n### Impact\n\nDisclosure of server-side configuration giving an attacker information on server-side ports, private IP addresses, and/or private domain names.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.39.2`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds.\n\n### Proof of Concept\n\n1. Set the value of the environment variable `FIDES_PRIVACY_CENTER__SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` of your Fides Privacy Center container before start-up to a private value such as `https://some.private.domain.name/api/v1` and start the Privacy Center application.\n\n2. Once the application is up, perform a HTTP GET request of the Privacy Center's main page e.g. `https://privacy.example.com` . The value of `SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL` is returned in the response's body.\n\n\n```\n~ ‚ùØ curl -s https://privacy.example.com/ | \\\ngrep '__NEXT_DATA__' | \\\nsed 's/.*<script id=\"__NEXT_DATA__\" type=\"application\\/json\">//;s/<\\/script>.*//' | \\\njq '.props.serverEnvironment.settings.SERVER_SIDE_FIDES_API_URL'\n\"https://some.private.domain.name/api/v1\"\n```",
