  "summary": "TorchServe vulnerable to bypass of allowed_urls configuration",
  "details": "### Impact\nTorchServe's check on allowed_urls configuration can be by-passed if the URL contains characters such as \"..\" but it does not prevent the model from being downloaded into the model store. Once a file is downloaded, it can be referenced without providing a URL the second time, which effectively bypasses the allowed_urls security check. Customers using PyTorch inference Deep Learning Containers (DLC) through Amazon SageMaker and EKS are not affected.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue in TorchServe has been fixed by validating the URL without characters such as \"..\" before downloading: [#3082](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3082).\n\nTorchServe release 0.11.0 includes the fix to address this vulnerability.\n\n### References\n* [#3082](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/pull/3082)\n* [TorchServe release v0.11.0](https://github.com/pytorch/serve/releases/tag/v0.11.0)\n\nThank Kroll Cyber Risk for for responsibly disclosing this issue.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, we ask that you contact AWS Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting) or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).
