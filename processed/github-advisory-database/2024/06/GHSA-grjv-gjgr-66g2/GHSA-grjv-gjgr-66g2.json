  "summary": "SpiceDB exclusions can result in no permission returned when permission expected",
  "details": "### Background\n\nUse of an exclusion under an arrow that has multiple resources may resolve to `NO_PERMISSION` when permission is expected.\n\nFor example, given this schema:\n\n```zed\ndefinition user {}\n\ndefinition folder {\n  relation member: user\n  relation banned: user\n  permission view = member - banned\n}\n\ndefinition resource {\n  relation folder: folder\n  permission view = folder->view\n}\n```\n\nIf the resource exists under *multiple* folders and the user has access to view more than a single folder, SpiceDB may report the user does not have access due to a failure in the exclusion dispatcher to request that *all* the folders in which the user is a member be returned\n\n### Impact\n\nPermission is returned as `NO_PERMISSION` when `PERMISSION` is expected on the `CheckPermission` API.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n",
