  "summary": "Pimcore Customer Data Framework Improper Access Control allows unprivileged user to access customers duplicates list",
  "details": "### Summary\nAn authenticated and unauthorized user can access the list of potential duplicate users and see their data.\n\n### Details\nPermissions do not seem to be enforced when reaching the `/admin/customermanagementframework/duplicates/list` endpoint allowing an authenticated user without the permissions to access the endpoint and query the data available there. It seems that the access control is not enforced in this place :\n<https://github.com/pimcore/customer-data-framework/blob/b4af625ef327c58d05ef7cdf145fa749d2d4195e/src/Controller/Admin/DuplicatesController.php#L43>\n\n### PoC\nIn order to reproduce the issue, the following steps can be followed :\n\n1. As an administrator :\n  a. Create a role without any permission through Settings → User & Roles → Roles in the administration panel\n  b. Create an user through Settings → User & Roles → Users and assign it the unprivileged role previously created\n2. Log out the current administrator and log in with this new user\n3. Access to the following endpoint `https://pimcore_instance/admin/customermanagementframework/duplicates/list` and the results will be returned to this unauthorized user\n\n### Impact\nAn unauthorized user can access PII data from customers without being authorized to.\n",
