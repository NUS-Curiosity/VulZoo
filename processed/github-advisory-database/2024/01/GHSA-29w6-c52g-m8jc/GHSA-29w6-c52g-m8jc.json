  "summary": "C5 Firefly III CSV Injection.",
  "details": "### Summary\nCSV injection is a vulnerability where untrusted user input in CSV files can lead to unauthorized access or data manipulation. \nIn my subsequent testing of the application.\n\n### Details\nI discovered that there is an option to \"Export Data\" from the web app to your personal computer, which exports a \"csv\" file that can be opened with Excel software that supports macros.\n\nP.S \nI discovered that the web application's is offering a demo-site that anyone may access to play with the web application. So, there's a chance that someone will export the data (CVS) from the demo site and execute it on their PC, giving the malicious actor a complete control over their machine. (if a user enters a malicious payload to the website).\n\n### PoC\nYou can check out my vulnerability report if you need more details/PoC with screenshots: (removed by JC5)\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker can exploit this by entering a specially crafted payload to one of the fields, and when a user export the csv file using the \"Export Data\" function, the attacker can potentiality can RCE.\n\n### Addendum by JC5, the developer of Firefly III\nThere is zero impact on normal users, even on vulnerable versions.",
