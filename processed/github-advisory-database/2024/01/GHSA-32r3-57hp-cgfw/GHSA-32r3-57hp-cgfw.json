  "summary": "EverShop at risk to unauthorized access via weak HMAC secret",
  "details": "An issue was discovered in NPM's package @evershop/evershop before version 1.0.0-rc.9. The HMAC secret used for generating tokens is hardcoded as \"secret\". A weak HMAC secret poses a risk because attackers can use the predictable secret to create valid JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), allowing them access to important information and actions within the application.",
