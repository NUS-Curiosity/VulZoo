  "summary": "No permission checks for editing/deleting records with CSV import form",
  "details": "### Impact\nUsers who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions.\n\nThe likelyhood of a user having create permissions but _not_ having edit or delete permissions is low, but it _is_ possible.\n\nNote that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the [`showImportForm` public property](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Admin/ModelAdmin.html#property_showImportForm), nor does it impact the `SecurityAdmin` section.\n\n#### Action may be required\n\nIf you have a custom implementation of [`BulkLoader`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html), you should update your implementation to respect permissions when the return value of [`getCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_getCheckPermissions) is true.\n\nIf you are using any `BulkLoader` in your own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, you should consider passing `true` to [`setCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_setCheckPermissions) if the data is provided by users.\n\n**Base CVSS:** [4.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)\n**Reported by:** Guy Sartorelli from Silverstripe\n\n### References\n- https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2023-49783\n",
