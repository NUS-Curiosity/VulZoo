  "summary": "Laravel Pulse Allows Remote Code Execution via Unprotected Query Method",
  "details": "A vulnerability has been discovered in Laravel Pulse that could allow remote code execution through the public `remember()` method in the `Laravel\\Pulse\\Livewire\\Concerns\\RemembersQueries` trait. This method is accessible via Livewire components and can be exploited to call arbitrary callables within the application. \n\n### Impact\n\nAn authenticated user with access to Laravel Pulse dashboard can execute arbitrary code by calling any function or static method that meets the following criteria:\n\n- The callable is a function or static method\n- The callable has no parameters or no strict parameter types\n\n### Vulnerable Components\n\n- The `remember(callable $query, string $key = '')` method in `Laravel\\Pulse\\Livewire\\Concerns\\RemembersQueries`\n- Affects all Pulse card components that use this trait\n\n### Attack Vectors\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited through Livewire component interactions, for example:\n\n```php\nwire:click=\"remember('\\\\Illuminate\\\\Support\\\\Facades\\\\Config::all', 'config')\"\n```\n\n### Credit\n\nThank you to Jeremy Angele for reporting this vulnerability.\n",
