  ],
  "summary": "Angular Expressions - Remote Code Execution when using locals",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAn attacker can write a malicious expression that escapes the sandbox to execute arbitrary code on the system.\n\nExample of vulnerable code:\n\n```js\nconst expressions = require(\"angular-expressions\");\nconst result = expressions.compile(\"__proto__.constructor\")({}, {});\n// result should be undefined, however for versions <=1.4.2, it returns an object.\n```\n\nWith a more complex (undisclosed) payload, one can get full access to Arbitrary code execution on the system.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in version 1.4.3 of angular-expressions.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is one workaround if it not possible for you to update : \n\n* Make sure that you use the compiled function with just one argument : ie this is not vulnerable : \n    `const result = expressions.compile(\"__proto__.constructor\")({});` : in this case you lose the feature of locals if you need it.\n\n### Credits\n\nCredits go to [JorianWoltjer](https://github.com/JorianWoltjer) who has found the issue and reported it to use. https://jorianwoltjer.com/",
