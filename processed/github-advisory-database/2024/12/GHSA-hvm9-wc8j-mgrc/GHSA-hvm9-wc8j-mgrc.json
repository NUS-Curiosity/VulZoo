  "details": "### Impact\nAn issue with the way OTAPI manages client connections results in stale UUIDs remaining on `RemoteClient` instances after a player disconnects.\n\nBecause of this, if the following conditions are met a player may assume the login state of a previously connected player:\n1. The server has UUID login enabled\n2. An authenticated player disconnects\n3. A subsequent player connects with a modified client that does not send the `ClientUUID#68` packet during connection\n4. The server assigns the same `RemoteClient` object that belonged to the originally authenticated player to the newly connected player\n\n\n### Patches\nTShock 5.2.1 hotfixes this issue. A more robust fix will be made to OTAPI itself.\n\n### Workarounds\nImplement a RemoteClient reset event handler in a plugin like so:\n```csharp\npublic override void Initialize()\n{\n        On.Terraria.RemoteClient.Reset += RemoteClient_Reset;\n}\n\nprivate static void RemoteClient_Reset(On.Terraria.RemoteClient.orig_Reset orig, RemoteClient client)\n{\n\tclient.ClientUUID = null;\n        orig(client);\n}\n```\n\n",
