  "summary": "lgsl Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in lgsl. The issue arises from improper sanitation of user input. Everyone who accesses this page will be affected by this attack.\n\n### Details\n\nThe function `lgsl_query_40` in `lgsl_protocol.php` has implemented an HTTP crawler. This function makes a request to the registered game server, and upon crawling the malicious `/info` endpoint with our payload, will render our javascript on the info page. This information is being displayed via `lgsl_details.php`\n\n#### Affected Code:\n```php\n      foreach ($server['e'] as $field => $value) {\n        $value = preg_replace('/((https*:\\/\\/|https*:\\/\\/www\\.|www\\.)[\\w\\d\\.\\-\\/=$?â€‹]*)/i', \"<a href='$1' target='_blank'>$1</a>\", html_entity_decode($value));\n        $output .= \"\n        <tr><td> {$field} </td><td> {$value} </td></tr>\";\n      }\n```\n### PoC\n\n1. Create a game server with type `eco` and set the target host and port accordingly to your ttack server. I have crafted this json payload that is being parsed according to the schema and being served on `/info` \n\n2. Serve the following JSON payload at `/info` on your handler\n```json\n{\n  \"Animals\": \"1\",\n  \"EconomyDesc\": \"<img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>\"\n}\n```\n3. Access the corresponding server info page at `/s?=`. Upon refreshing & crawling our server, it should execute our javascript.\n\n",
