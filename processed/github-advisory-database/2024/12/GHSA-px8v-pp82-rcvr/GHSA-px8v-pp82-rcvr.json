  "summary": "quic-go affected by an ICMP Packet Too Large Injection Attack on Linux",
  "details": "### Impact\nAn off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used `IP_PMTUDISC_DO`, the kernel would then return a \"message too large\" error on `sendmsg`, i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet.\n\nBy setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection).\n\nAs far as I understand, the kernel tracks the MTU per 4-tuple, so the attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack (assuming that it knows the server's IP and port).\n\n### Patches\n\nThe fix is easy: Use `IP_PMTUDISC_PROBE` instead of `IP_PMTUDISC_DO`. This socket option only sets the DF bit, but disables the kernel's MTU tracking.\n\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nFixed in https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/4729\nReleased in https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/releases/tag/v0.48.2\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nUse iptables to drop ICMP Unreachable packets.\n\n### References\n\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\nThis bug was discovered while doing research for my new IETF draft on IP fragmentation: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-seemann-tsvwg-udp-fragmentation/\n",
