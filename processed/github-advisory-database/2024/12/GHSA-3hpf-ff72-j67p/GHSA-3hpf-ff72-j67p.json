  "summary": "shared_preferences_android vulnerability",
  "details": "### Impact\nDue to some data types not being natively representable for the available storage options, shared_preferences_android serializes and deserializes special string prefixes to store these unrepresentable data types. This allows arbitrary classes to be deserialized leading to arbitrary code execution.\n\nAs a result, Files containing the preferences can be overwritten with a malicious one with a deserialization payload that triggers as soon as the data is loaded from the disk.\n\n### Patches\n2.3.4\n\n### Workarounds\nUpdate to the latest version of shared_preferences_android that contains the changes to address this vulnerability.\n\n### References\nTBD\n\n### For more information\nSee [our community page](https://dart.dev/community) to find ways to contact the team.\n\n### Thanks\nThank you so much to Oskar Zeino-Mahmalat from sonarsource for finding and reporting this issue!",
