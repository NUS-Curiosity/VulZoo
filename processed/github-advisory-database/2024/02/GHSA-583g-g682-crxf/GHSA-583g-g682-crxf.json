  "summary": "Micronaut management endpoints vulnerable to drive-by localhost attack",
  "details": "### Summary\nEnabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought.\n\n### Details\nA malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests are [\"simple\"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests) and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured, are vulnerable to being triggered.\n\n### Impact\nProduction environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host, who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development.\n",
