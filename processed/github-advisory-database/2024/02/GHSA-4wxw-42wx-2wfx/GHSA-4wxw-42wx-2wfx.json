  "summary": "Apache Solr Schema Designer blindly \"trusts\" all configsets",
  "details": "Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache Solr.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Solr from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0.\n\nThe Schema Designer was introduced to allow users to more easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets.\nHowever, when the feature was created, the \"trust\" (authentication) of these configSets was not considered.\nExternal library loading is only available to configSets that are \"trusted\" (created by authenticated users), thus non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code Execution.\nSince the Schema Designer loaded configSets without taking their \"trust\" into account, configSets that were created by unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when used in the Schema Designer.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or 8.11.3, both of which fix the issue.\n\n",
