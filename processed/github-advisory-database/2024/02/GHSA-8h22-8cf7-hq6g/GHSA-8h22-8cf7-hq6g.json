  "summary": "Rails has possible Sensitive Session Information Leak in Active Storage",
  "details": "# Possible Sensitive Session Information Leak in Active Storage\n\nThere is a possible sensitive session information leak in Active Storage.  By\ndefault, Active Storage sends a `Set-Cookie` header along with the user's\nsession cookie when serving blobs.  It also sets `Cache-Control` to public.\nCertain proxies may cache the Set-Cookie, leading to an information leak.\n\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-26144.\n\nVersions Affected:  >= 5.2.0, < 7.1.0\nNot affected:       < 5.2.0, > 7.1.0\nFixed Versions:     7.0.8.1, 6.1.7.7\n\nImpact\n------\nA proxy which chooses to caches this request can cause users to share\nsessions. This may include a user receiving an attacker's session or vice\nversa.\n\nThis was patched in 7.1.0 but not previously identified as a security\nvulnerability.\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the\nworkarounds immediately.\n\nReleases\n--------\nThe fixed releases are available at the normal locations.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\nUpgrade to Rails 7.1.X, or configure caching proxies not to cache the\nSet-Cookie headers.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThanks to [tyage](https://hackerone.com/tyage) for reporting this!\n",
