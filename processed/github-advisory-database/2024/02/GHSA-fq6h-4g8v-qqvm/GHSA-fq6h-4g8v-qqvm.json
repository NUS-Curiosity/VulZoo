  "summary": "CKEditor4 Cross-site Scripting vulnerability caused by incorrect CDATA detection",
  "details": "### Affected packages\nThe vulnerability has been discovered in the core HTML parsing module and may affect all editor instances that:\n* Enabled [full-page editing](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/fullpage.html) mode,\n* or enabled [CDATA](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_dtd.html#property-S-cdata) elements in [Advanced Content Filtering](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html) configuration (defaults to `script` and `style` elements).\n\n### Impact\n\nA potential vulnerability has been discovered in CKEditor 4 HTML processing core module.
