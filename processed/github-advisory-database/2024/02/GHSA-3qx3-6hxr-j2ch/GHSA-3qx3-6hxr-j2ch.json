  "summary": "eza Potential Heap Overflow Vulnerability for AArch64",
  "details": "### Summary\nIn `eza`, there exists a potential heap overflow vulnerability, first seen when using Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi series system, on `ubuntu-raspi` kernel, relating to the `.git` directory.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability seems to be triggered by the `.git` directory in some projects. This issue may be related to specific files, and the directory structure also plays a role in triggering the vulnerability. Files/folders that may be involved in triggering the vulnerability include `.git/HEAD`, `.git/refs`, and `.git/objects`.\n\nAs @polly pointed out to me, this is likely caused by [GHSA-j2v7-4f6v-gpg8](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/security/advisories/GHSA-j2v7-4f6v-gpg8), which we do seem to use currently.\n\n### PoC\nFor more information check @CuB3y0nd's blogpost [blog](https://www.cubeyond.net/blog/eza-cve-report).\n\n### Impact\nArbitrary code execution.",
