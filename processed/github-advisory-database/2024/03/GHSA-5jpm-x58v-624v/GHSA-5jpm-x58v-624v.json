  "summary": "Netty's HttpPostRequestDecoder can OOM",
  "details": "### Summary\nThe `HttpPostRequestDecoder` can be tricked to accumulate data. I have spotted currently two attack vectors \n\n### Details\n1. While the decoder can store items on the disk if configured so, there are no limits to the number of fields the form can have, an attacher can send a chunked post consisting of many small fields that will be accumulated in the `bodyListHttpData` list.\n2. The decoder cumulates bytes in the `undecodedChunk` buffer until it can decode a field, this field can cumulate data without limits\n\n### PoC\n\nHere is a Netty branch that provides a fix + tests : https://github.com/vietj/netty/tree/post-request-decoder\n\n\nHere is a reproducer with Vert.x (which uses this decoder) https://gist.github.com/vietj/f558b8ea81ec6505f1e9a6ca283c9ae3\n\n### Impact\nAny Netty based HTTP server that uses the `HttpPostRequestDecoder` to decode a form.",
