Subject: Re: Is third party javascript on a login page
 considered dangerous?

It depends.

You can prevent some classes of JS running such as inline JS so only trusted JS is executed. If you design your site to expect to pull from a specific CDN all the time, disabling inline JS (third party or otherwise) would prevent any attacker-controlled JS (say from XSS) from executing on the login page while letting you use any “safe” or trusted js.

If you perform SHA sum checking on resources with resource integrity from third party sites, you can be sure you won’t load a backdoor or otherwise-modified version after deployment.

If you are loading third party JS from a trusted source, but not performing resource integrity checks over plaintext HTTP, you obviously still can’t trust the final JS delivered.

Using third-party JS on a login page isn’t inherently dangerous. Having no control or ability to know when that JS changes is the dangerous part.
