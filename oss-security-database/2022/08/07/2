As a reader, I would much rather have a self-contained list post with a huge
snippet of code, than a link to an external source. But in this case it isn't
huge at all; the entire contents of https://github.com/ivd38/exim_overflow
(README.md, exim.conf, asan.log) are certainly short enough for a list post.
