It would have been helpful to notify the developers and maintainers of
this code that there is an issue.  They will not see a random email on
the oss-security mailing list as they are not subscribed here.

To find who is responsible for this code, use the get_maintainers.pl
script in the kernel tree.  The output for it for this problem is:

$ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl arch/x86/kernel/time.c
Thomas Gleixner <tglx@...utronix.de> (maintainer:X86 ARCHITECTURE (32-BIT AND 64-BIT))
Ingo Molnar <mingo@...hat.com> (maintainer:X86 ARCHITECTURE (32-BIT AND 64-BIT))
Borislav Petkov <bp@...en8.de> (maintainer:X86 ARCHITECTURE (32-BIT AND 64-BIT))
Dave Hansen <dave.hansen@...ux.intel.com> (maintainer:X86 ARCHITECTURE (32-BIT AND 64-BIT))
x86@...nel.org (maintainer:X86 ARCHITECTURE (32-BIT AND 64-BIT))
"H. Peter Anvin" <hpa@...or.com> (reviewer:X86 ARCHITECTURE (32-BIT AND 64-BIT))
linux-kernel@...r.kernel.org (open list:X86 ARCHITECTURE (32-BIT AND 64-BIT))

Also, this issue seems to require root permissions (i.e. write
permissions on the kernel profiler) in order to be triggered.

Hope this helps,
