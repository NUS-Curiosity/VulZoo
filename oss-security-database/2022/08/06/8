Hi,


Here is another bug which has been silently fixed in Exim.

It has not been recognized as a security issue, many distros still don't 
have this patch.

Original report + patch  is here - 
https://github.com/Exim/exim/commit/d4bc023436e4cce7c23c5f8bb5199e178b4cc743

Analysis of the bug  - https://github.com/ivd38/exim_overflow

I don't post here because it is huge snippet of code.


regards,

-e
