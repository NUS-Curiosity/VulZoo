Subject: CVE-2022-20359 is not mentioned in linked bulletin

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-20359

URL: https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2022-08-01

CVE-2022-20359 is not mentioned in that particular bulletin. Lots of
others, either side, but not that one.

Does anyone know of the correct URL for more information?
