Subject: CVE-2022-34158: Apache JSPWiki: User Group Privilege Escalation 

Severity: critical

Description:

A carefully crafted invocation on the Image plugin could trigger an CSRF vulnerability on Apache JSPWiki, which could allow a group privilege escalation of the attacker's account. Further examination of this issue established that it could also be used to modify the email associated with the attacked account, and then a reset password request from the login page. 

Mitigation:

Apache JSPWiki users should upgrade to 2.11.3 or later.
