Subject: CVE-2022-28731: Apache JSPWiki CSRF in UserPreferences.jsp 

Severity: critical

Description:

A carefully crafted request on UserPreferences.jsp could trigger an CSRF vulnerability on Apache JSPWiki, which could allow the attacker to modify the email associated with the attacked account, and then a reset password request from the login page. 

Mitigation:

Apache JSPWiki users should upgrade to 2.11.3 or later. Installations >= 2.7.0 can also enable user management workflows' manual approval to mitigate the issue.
