Hi,

I have tried requesting CVE IDs for those three times (first request was 
done in 2021-06-12) and failed so far.

All three attempts were rejected for the following reasons:

 > The Jenkins CNA is responsible for assigning CVE IDs to

However, as a far as I understand this not the case. Here is the scope 
of the Jenkins CNA [1]:

 > The Jenkins project is a CVE Numbers Authority (CNA) for Jenkins

A Selenium plugin [2,3] in indeed included in the list of Jenkins
plugins. This plugin includes [4] selenium-standalone-server but is
different from selenium-standalone-server [5] itself.

I asked the Jenkins CNA:

Here is the answer from the Jenkins CNA:

 > You are correct: Selenium is not in the scope of the Jenkins CNA.
 > That said, we assigned CVE IDs in the past for Jenkins plugins
 > integrating Jenkins and Selenium in some way (CVE-2021-21672,
 > CVE-2020-2196). Those are in our scope. Perhaps this is the source

In my third CVE request attempt, I explicitly stated:

 > [Additional Information]
 > This was previously reported and denied with the following reason:
 >
 > > The Jenkins CNA is responsible for assigning CVE IDs to

However, the request is still rejected for the same reason.

Any idea how to proceed from there?
