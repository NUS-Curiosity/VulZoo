Further in the linux-distros thread, this got assigned CVE-2022-1263,
however is this really a security issue - in other words, is a security
boundary crossed in triggering the bug?  I think it is not, and if so
the CVE ID should probably be rejected.  From the PoC:

> 		res = syscall(__NR_openat, 0xffffffffffffff9cul, "/dev/kvm", 0ul, 0ul);

In fact, also in the linux-distros thread it was promptly agreed that
this doesn't need an embargo - perhaps precisely because of no security
relevance?  If so, that should have been said explicitly, so a CVE ID
wouldn't be assigned (it was by another person).
