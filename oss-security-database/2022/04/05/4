Subject: CVE-2022-23974: Apache Pinot: Pinot segment push endpoint has a

Description:

In 0.9.3 or older versions of Apache Pinot segment upload path allowed segment directories to be imported into pinot tables. In pinot installations that allow open access to the controller a specially crafted request can potentially be exploited to cause disruption in pinot service.
