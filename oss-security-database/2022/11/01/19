My understanding was that libcurl gets updated whenever BoringSSL needs
a change, and that libcurlâ€™s API does not depend on what TLS backend it
uses.  Applications would not be impacted, since they would only use the
libcurl API and ABI.

That said, this would require constantly updating to new versions of
libcurl + BoringSSL, so it might not make sense in general.  LibreSSL or
rustls could well be a better choice.
