Any code should be treated as potentially dangerous.
The less you have overall, the better.
I do not see why a login page of all things needs code.

Input form, fields for username / password / other authentication 
tokens, a submit button. Boom, done. If there is a REST interface or 
somesuch, authentication tokens are also provided at once when a client 
makes a request (i.e. with no code execution apriori) - so why would 
your login page need any.
