We see this over at https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/ :

  ``Although BoringSSL is an open source project, it is not intended
    for general use, as OpenSSL is. We don't recommend that third parties
    depend upon it. Doing so is likely to be frustrating because there
    are no guarantees of API or ABI stability.''
