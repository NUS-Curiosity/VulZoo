alpine linux successfully manages to build rust with itself for x86_64,
i586 (currently, might be pentium4 x86 in the future), armhf (v6+hf),
armv7, aarch64, ppc64le, s390x, and riscv64. s390x/riscv64 were the
hardest to get to work here, and the ecosystem has a few issues on those
architectures (old libc/nix crate versions, rustls crate not having asm
for s390x/riscv64 (+ ppc64le), to name two), but the same really goes
for a lot of software even in c/++ in general on those architectures
lacking support.

so yes, this seems like a bug that should be reported.
