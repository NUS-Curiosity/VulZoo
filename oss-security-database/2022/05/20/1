As a distribution, our preference is to see sources/patches and binaries
released simultaneously by both upstream and distributions. This way,
the window of exploitation for attackers combing through git history
and/or changelogs is as small as possible. If the patch first appears in
git or on a public mailing list before distros have had a chance to
prepare, build, and test a new release then attackers who closely
monitor these have an advantage over our users.

However, barring that option, our preference would be to adjust the
linux-distros list policy as proposed (option 1/Greg KH's proposal).

Absolutely agree on this -- we just have slightly different ideas of
what the best way to keep users safe is.

Absolutely, there is no doubt that our users are more secure with the
advance notice that the linux-distros list has provided us with so far.

In any case, I really think we should take this opportunity to iron out
a process that both upstream and distros are happy with and that is also
less confusing for people who want to report security issues, as that
itself has been a problem for a long time (3 mailing lists, different
embargo periods, ...).

I'll respond a bit later with a slightly more detailed option that also
includes potential modifications to the in-kernel documentation as
displayed on kernel.org.
