Subject: Re: linux-distros list policy and Linux kernel

Hi,

Thank you all for the helpful replies in this thread.  Here's my summary
of what was said so far:

As seen from replies by Jason and Greg, I didn't make the distinction
between my suggested options 0 and 2 clear enough.  They were:

> 0. Do nothing specific - let things work or fail on their own.

> 2. Strictly enforce the policy as it is - and be in conflict with Linux
> kernel security team, and handle fewer issues via linux-distros.

Let me clarify.  As I wrote, after the disagreement in February, "the
handling was hectic - indeed, people felt discouraged from enforcing the
policy."  So by option 0 I referred to the loose (non-)enforcement we've
had since February until now, and by option 2 to enforcement at least as
strict as we had before February.

Although I wouldn't necessarily have the list's future decided by a
majority vote, I counted something like 4.5 votes for relaxing the list
policy to accommodate (at least) Linux kernel community's workflow:

and 1 vote for preserving the current policy:

A few of you also said the linux-distros list is still valuable, and no
one said otherwise.

I think now we need to come up with a specific edit to the policy, and I
think the exception should ideally be limited to Linux kernel issues
currently/recently handled with the kernel's security team involved.
Ideally, we'd also manage to simplify rather than further complicate the
policy - a goal inconsistent with granting only a limited exception?

A number of other related issues were brought up as well, including by
Jason A. Donenfeld, Seth Arnold, Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo, and
Vegard Nossum.  From a practical perspective, it looks like Vegard
Nossum and maybe Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo intend to propose changes
to the kernel's Documentation/admin-guide/security-bugs.rst:
