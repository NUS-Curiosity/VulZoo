Isn't this what the "GSD" process is supposed to accomplish:
	https://globalsecuritydatabase.org/

The stable kernel team (i.e. Sasha) asks for identifiers for kernel
issues all the time from this group now that MITRE refuses to assign
CVEs for kernel fixes made in stable kernel releases.

If you look in their database at github, there are lots of kernel
commits being tracked there, is that sufficient for your needs?

I think this an independent issue that doesn't have much to do with
linux-distros other than currently linux-distros is one of the simplest
ways that people can get CVEs for kernel issues at the moment.
