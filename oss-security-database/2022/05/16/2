Though I want to add a little more to this discussion, I think this needs
clarification and is really one of the main pain points here, in my opinion.

"Although our preference is to release fixes for publicly undisclosed bugs
as soon as they become available, this may be postponed at the request of
the reporter or an affected party for up to 7 calendar days from the start
of the release process"

This is about the fixes, not the security report. As I read it, once a fix is
developed/reviewed/accepted, kernel maintainers/developers may hold the *fix*
release up to 7 days.

Right in the next paragraph, though:

"While embargoed information may be shared with trusted individuals in
order to develop a fix, such information will not be published alongside
the fix or on any other disclosure channel without the permission of the
reporter.  This includes but is not limited to the original bug report
and followup discussions (if any), exploits, CVE information or the
identity of the reporter."

This means that it's now up to the reporter to disclose any information if they
want to. They may never disclose it. They may wait for someone else to disclose
it. Or decide to disclose it immediately.

Now, as you said earlier in your message (which is why I kept that excerpt),
linux-distros ends up having such a role where reports sent to it should be
made public in no more than 14 days. But there is no such mechanism on
security@...nel.org rules as documented at
Documentation/admin-guide/security-bugs.rst, as I understand it.
