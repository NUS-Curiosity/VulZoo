Subject: OPEN SOURCE NTFS-3G SECURITY ADVISORY NTFS3G-SA-2022-0002

Security vulnerabilities were identified in the open source NTFS-3G 
built with internal libfuse (known as libfuse-lite) or libfuse2. These 
vulnerabilities were confirmed and resolved. A proof-of-concept exploit 
against a specific NTFS-3G build exists.

These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute arbitrary privileged 
code, if the attacker has local access and the ntfs-3g binary is setuid 
root.

We recommend installing and applying the update with the security fixes, 
and advise to follow security guidance and frameworks such as NIST for 
assessing and improving an organization’s abilities to prevent, detect, 
and respond to security threats and cyber attacks.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS: All previous versions of open source NTFS-3G compiled 
with internal libfuse (known as libfuse-lite) or libfuse2.

WORKAROUND: None

SOLUTION: Upgrade to 2022.5.17

PROJECT URL: https://github.com/tuxera/ntfs-3g
