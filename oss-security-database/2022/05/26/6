I think it's important to remember that closed mailing lists filled
with private/embargoed exploits become valuable targets. They have
been compromised ever since Zardoz in the 1980s, vendor-sec was
discontinued for the same reason. By keeping zerodays in linux-distros
you paint a target on every recipient of the list. You should assume
that any working exploit code you share to a mailing list will
eventually fall into the hands of bad actors. Therefore, I don't think
selective full-disclosure works.

Regards,
Philip
