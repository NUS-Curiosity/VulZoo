Yes, indeed / in know (since then) but it wasn't clear if all participants in this thread are aware of this fact.

But i just have noticed that my posting was only partly relevant for the quoted message and the question of the OP "Why is this being allowed…" because i have missed that Oracle (if they as the assigning CNA are aware that Java 15 and 16 are affected) AFAICT indeed haven't provided any reference so far about all known affected versions / products.
