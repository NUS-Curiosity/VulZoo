That is pretty much impossible and goes against the whole goal of "get
this fixed and in a public tree and only tell the world that it was an
issue after-the-fact" way that the kernel team works.  If we put all of
that in the commit to start with, the whole world knows this info.  We
can't go back in time and change git commits for obvious reasons.
