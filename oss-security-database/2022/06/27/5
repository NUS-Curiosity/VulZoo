Subject: CVE-2022-33879: Apache Tika: Incomplete fix and new regex DoS in
 StandardsExtractingContentHandler 

Severity: low

Description:

The initial fixes in CVE-2022-30126 and CVE-2022-30973 for regexes in the StandardsExtractingContentHandler were insufficient, and we found a separate, new regex DoS in a different regex in the StandardsExtractingContentHandler. These are now fixed in 1.28.4 and 2.4.1.

This incomplete fix was discovered and reported by the CodeQL team member [@atorralba (Tony Torralba)](https://github.com/atorralba) and [@jarlob (Jaroslav Lobaƒçevski)](https://github.com/jarlob) from Github Security Lab.  The new ReDos was discovered by the Apache Tika team.
