on ubuntu 20 a lot of stuff depends on libgmp:

$ apt-cache rdepends libgmp10 | wc -l
2442
$ apt-cache rdepends libgmp10 | grep -i crypt | wc -l
28

some examples:
  gcc-9
  gawk
  g++-9
  dnsmasq-base
  cpp-9-s390x-linux-gnu

will the infidels who argue that crash in python is nothing
still will claim that gmp crash in any of the 2442 packages
is still nothing?
