Apple's released new security advisories yesterday, with 4 WebKit
security fixes, two of which are code execution issues, but all 4 of
which have public bugzilla bugs and public patches, since as early as
late June (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213442):

https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=242278
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=241969
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=242762
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243236

Is Apple fixing WebKit security issues in public while obfuscating the
impact? This pattern seems to be potentially putting downstream WebKit
users at a lot of risk, now that 2 code execution bugs (with patches!)
are public (and have been for *months*, albeit without knowledge of
security impact), and users need to wait weeks for remediation.
