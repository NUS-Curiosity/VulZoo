This is correct, and IMO it is just a bug in Python.  Python should
either provide better algorithms itself, or use an external library that
does so.  Using GMP would be a good choice where available, but would
require using GMPâ€™s non-allocating functions, as the allocating ones
abort in out-of-memory situations.
