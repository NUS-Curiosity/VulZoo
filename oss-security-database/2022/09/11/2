Subject: Re: CVE-2019-18960: Firecracker v0.18.0 and v0.19.0 vsock buffer overflow

Hi,

FWIW, Valentina Palmiotti @chompie1337 and her colleagues at Grapl have
recently looked into exploiting the below vulnerability, and blogged
about it here:

https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/attacking-firecracker

The attempts so far have bumped into guard pages, some of unidentified
origin.  Maybe someone else will want to continue this research.

The blog post above includes a lot of other observations, not limited to
this one vulnerability and its exploitation, but also covering VMMs,
Firecracker vs. QEMU, Rust "unsafe" blocks, guard pages, hardening.

I guess further research could be to identify the source of all guard
pages observed, see if they're created consistently and reliably across
all platforms, harden that if not.  This could help mitigate some other
vulnerabilities, maybe in other Rust programs.
