I didn't say it wasn't a denial of service, but you can trivially
create all manner of "denials of service" (and far, far worse things
too) of the CPython interpreter and anything running in it by asking
it to execute arbitrary Python code. It's more a question of whether
that's something that can or even should be "fixed." If a program's
author chooses to intentionally pass user-supplied code to CPython,
hopefully they do so knowing all the risks and informing their users
of the same.
