Subject: Grant Opportunities to Protect Open Source

Hello All,

I'm a fellow at Plaintextgroup.com by Schmidt Futures, we've launched an
RFP to fund new ideas and experiments to improve OSS sustainability -- see
https://github.com/PlaintextGroup/oss-virtual-incubator and our WSJ piece
https://wsj-articles-legacy.sc.onservo.com/articles/protect-open-source-software-prevention-oss-public-use-cybersecurity-innovation-cyberattack-apache-log4j-11643316125.
If you know people who might be a good fit, or if any projects you're
working on might intersect with this, do let me know!

Best,

*Deepesh Chaudhari*
