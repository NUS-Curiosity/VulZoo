Subject: zlib memory corruption on deflate (i.e. compress)

Greetings list, I was recently trying to track down a reproducible crash
in a compressor. Believe it or not, it really was a bug in
zlib-1.2.11 when compressing (not decompressing!) certain inputs.

I reported it upstream, but it turns out the issue has been public since
2018, but the patch never made it into a release. As far as I know,
nobody ever assigned it a CVE.

https://github.com/madler/zlib/commit/5c44459c3b28a9bd3283aaceab7c615f8020c531

As far as I can tell, no distros have picked this up.

Tavis.
