Subject: CVE-2022-22721: Apache HTTP Server: core: Possible buffer overflow
 with very large or unlimited LimitXMLRequestBody 

Severity: low

Description:

If LimitXMLRequestBody is set to allow request bodies larger than 350MB (defaults to 1M) on 32 bit systems an integer overflow happens which later causes out of bounds writes.

This issue affects Apache HTTP Server 2.4.52 and earlier.
