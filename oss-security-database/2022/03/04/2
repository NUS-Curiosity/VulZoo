Subject: CVE-2022-25312: An XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability
 exists in the Apache Any23 RDFa XSLTStylesheet extractor

Description:

An XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability was discovered in
the Any23 RDFa XSLTStylesheet extractor and is known to affect Any23
versions < 2.7. XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a
web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with
an application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker
to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact
with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can
access.

Resolution:

This issue is fixed in Apache Any23 2.7 which can be downloaded from
https://any23.apache.org/download.html. We strongly encourage all
Any23 users to upgrade to Apache Any23 2.7.

The Apache Any23 Project Management Committee would like to thank Lion
Tree a.k.a liontree0110 for reporting this issue.
