Subject: Memory leak in Linux HID-elo driver

Hi oss-security,

There is one memory leak in Linux HID driver, introduced in v5.13.0.
When hid_parse in elo_probe fails, it forgets to call usb_put_dev to
decrease the refcount, leading to memory leak in the Linux kernel.

This is fixed by 817b8b9c5396 [1] and already backported to Linux
stable 5.15 and 5.16.

I am not sure how to request one CVE on the CVE request webpage. Any
help would be appreciated.
