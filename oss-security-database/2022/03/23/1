Subject: Lack of TLS certification chain validation in ZAP Proxy

ZAP proxy does not verify the certificate chain of the HTTPS servers it 
connects to. For example, it connects without warning to servers 
presenting a self-signed certificate, an expired certificate, etc.

This opens up a browser configured to use ZAP as an intercepting proxy to:

1. man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks;
2. DNS rebinding attacks (to HTTPS servers configured as default virtual 
server).
