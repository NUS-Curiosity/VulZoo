Subject: Browser-mediated attacks on WebDriver servers

Several browser-mediated attacks on WebDriver servers:

* GeckoDriver CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2020-15660);
* GeckoDriver DNS-rebinding vulnerability (CVE-2021-4138);
* Chromedriver localhost-bound same-site/cross-origin request forgery 
vulnerability;
* Selenium server/Grid CSRF vulnerability;
* Selenium server/Grid DNS-rebinding vulnerability.

In all cases this could be used to trigger arbitrary code execution.
