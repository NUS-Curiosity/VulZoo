Subject: CVE-2021-36774: Apache Kylin: Mysql JDBC Connector Deserialize RCE

Severity: moderate

Description:

Apache Kylin allows users to read data from other database systems using JDBC. The MySQL JDBC driver supports certain properties, which, if left unmitigated, can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code from a hacker-controlled malicious MySQL server within Kylin server processes. 
This issue affects Apache Kylin Apache Kylin 2 version 2.6.6 and prior versions; Apache Kylin 3 version 3.1.2 and prior versions.

Mitigation:

Users of Kylin 2.x & Kylin 3.x should upgrade to 3.1.3 or apply patch https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1694.
