Subject: CVE-2021-27738: Apache Kylin: Improper Access Control to Streaming
 Coordinator & SSRF

Severity: moderate

Description:

All request mappings in `StreamingCoordinatorController.java` handling `/kylin/api/streaming_coordinator/*` REST API endpoints did not include any security checks, which allowed an unauthenticated user to issue arbitrary requests, such as assigning/unassigning of streaming cubes, creation/modification and deletion of replica sets, to the Kylin Coordinator.

For endpoints accepting node details in HTTP message body, unauthenticated (but limited) server-side request forgery (SSRF) can be achieved.

This issue affects Apache Kylin Apache Kylin 3 versions prior to 3.1.2.

Mitigation:

Users of Kylin 3.x should upgrade to 3.1.3 or apply patch https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1646.
