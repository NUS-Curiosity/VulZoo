Subject: Null pointer deref in unzip 6.0

Hello,

I discovered a null pointer dereference in unzip 6.0. All details, 
including the input required for reproduction can be found here: 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unzip/+bug/1957077. If you 
need further details, please do not hesitate to ask.

Regards,
Nils
