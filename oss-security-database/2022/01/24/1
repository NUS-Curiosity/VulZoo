Since (almost?) every WebKitGTK update includes fixes for bugs that
allow remote execution of arbitrary code, I'd expect that distributors
are well aware that every update is critical.

And given the complexity of a fully-featured browser engine, it probably
cannot be any other way: it's the same story for Firefox and Chrome.
