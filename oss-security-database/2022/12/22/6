I remember performing local privesc's against poorly-written cronjobs
that ran as root and parsed things in procfs. One bug was in a C
application that had a format string bug when parsing data from
procfs data.

Something akin to this (in C-like pseudo code):

```
fp = fopen("/some/logfile/here", "w+");
procfs_fp = fopen("/proc/pid/something")
fprintf(fp, something_read_from_procfs_fp);
```

Name your application "%n" or a shared object "%n" and you'll have a
fun time. (Of course, replace with actual format string exploit).

Process hollowing by abusing /proc/pid/maps and /proc/pid/mem was a
fun tactic back in the early 2000's.

We knew way back then the dangers of VFS-based wizardry. Did we lose
that knowledge somehow?
