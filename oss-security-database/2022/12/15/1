Subject: CVE-2022-32531: Apache BookKeeper: Java Client Uses Connection to
 Host that Failed Hostname Verification

Severity: Moderate

Description:

The Apache Bookkeeper Java Client (up to 4.14.5 and also 4.15.0) does
not close the connection to the
bookkeeper server when TLS hostname verification fails. This leaves
the bookkeeper client vulnerable to a man in the middle attack.

Solution:

Upgrade to 4.14.6 or to 4.15.1
