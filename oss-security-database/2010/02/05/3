i think this should get a CVE.  "wide links = no" is not really a
hardening feature.  it is a solution for a certain subset of samba
users [0].  many will need to set "wide links = yes" (in order to
use symlinks to local files) and will remain vulnerable.

besides, the Confidentiality Impact and Integrity Impact are rather
high since pretty much any file on the victim's system can be read 
(confidentiality) and /tmp and other locations are writeable
(integrity).
