Gentoo and Fedora distribution maintainers have also tested this patch
and verified that it works. The patch against 4.4.0 can easily be
obtained from here: http://websvn.kde.org/?view=revision&revision=1089241

As this is now backported to the 4.4 branch, it is expected that 4.4.0
will be the only release affected by this vulnerability.

Thanks,
Jeff
