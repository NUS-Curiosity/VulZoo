Subject: vulnerability in netpbm (CVE-2009-4274)

Marc Schoenefeld discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the way
that netpbm processed the contents of header files in xpm image files.
This could lead to a crash of the application processing a
specially-crafted xpm file (and linked to netpbm), or possibly to the
execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user processing
the xpm file.  This issue is assigned CVE-2009-4274.

The issue was corrected upstream in version 10.47.07 on Dec 29, 2009:

http://netpbm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/netpbm/stable/converter/ppm/xpmtoppm.c?view=patch&r1=995&r2=1076&pathrev=1076
