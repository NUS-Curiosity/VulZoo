Subject: CVE Request -- Squid -- SQUID-2010_1.txt

Hi Josh, Steve, vendors,

   Squid upstream has released updated versions fixing DoS
when processing specially crafted DNS packets [1].

 From the upstream advisory:

"This problem allows any trusted client or external server who can
  determine the squid receiving port to perform a short-term denial
  of service attack on the Squid service."

Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (can't find one in SQUID-2010_1.txt).

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
