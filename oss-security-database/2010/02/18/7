- What about users that already have such a device pluged in?
- Just because someone has access to your hardware does not mean
  they should have total control. Computer cases can be locked,
  even put in other rooms with only monitor and usb ports (and
  keyboard and mouse in usb) available to people that should only
  have user rights and not root rights.
  You can have employees/cameras to look users are not using drilling
  machines on the cases or open the keyboards to add chips.
  But you can hardly stop people from plugging in devices. (And I think
  studies show that if you add any device on the street, people finding
  them will plug them into their computer as the first thing they do).

It might be a minor issue or something not worth issuing a id, but a
security issue it is.
