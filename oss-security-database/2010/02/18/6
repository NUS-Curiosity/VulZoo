from a CVE purist perspective, if the security model is that "users with 
physical access should not be able to read portions of kernel memory" then 
a violation of that is technically a vulnerability, even if the attack 
complexity is high - assuming that there isn't already some easier way 
that the attacker can get the same results through legitimate means. 
Being able to crash the system by plugging in a USB device (for example) 
is about as easy as the defenestration exploit - i.e. throwing the 
computer out the window - so in that case I wouldn't view it as a 
vulnerability.  If someone with physical access can read the kernel memory 
that's being leaked, if don't already own the box, that seems a little 
more like a vulnerability to me.
