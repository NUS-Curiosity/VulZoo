Subject: CVE request: kernel: ALSA: hda-intel: Avoid divide by zero crash

hda-intel crashes the kernel due to a divide by zero in azx_position_ok.

Using mp3blaster-3.2.5 (latest version) to play MP3 audio, the reporter 
was able to crash the kernel by stopping and restarting playback using 
the "5" key repeatedly. This happens as a normal user, not only as root. 
Kernel backtrace points to azx_position_ok() dividing by zero.
