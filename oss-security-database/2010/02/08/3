Subject: gnome-screensaver vulnerability (CVE-2010-0414)

This is a heads up on a gnome-screensaver issue that was fixed upstream
today.

In version 2.28, it is possible to circumvent the security of screen
locking functionality by changing the physical monitor configuration.

Details are available in our bugzilla, along with the patch being used
by upstream to correct the issue:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=562217

We have assigned CVE-2010-0414 to this issue.

The code that caused this issue went into gnome-screensaver during the
2.24 development cycle, but auto-configuration of hotplugged monitors
didn't show up until 2.28, and that is a pre-requisite for triggering
the bug, so only 2.28 is vulnerable.
