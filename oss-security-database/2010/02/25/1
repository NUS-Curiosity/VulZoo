Subject: incorrect description for CVE-2010-0412 systemtap flaw

Hi Steve and other vendors.  There is a bit of confusion around the
description of CVE-2010-0412.  This was due to some miscommunication as
to whether or not the full extent of the flaw was public, which is why
I didn't send a message sooner to explain why it was assigned.

The original fix for CVE-2009-4273 was incomplete, as noted in the
upstream bug report for the original flaw:

http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11105#c8

This is still the same root flaw as CVE-2009-4273, not a different
vulnerability, so we had assigned CVE-2010-0412 as a "fix for the
incomplete fix of CVE-2009-4273", due to the fact CVE-2009-4273 has this
description:

"stap-server in SystemTap before 1.1 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in stap command-line
arguments in a request."

The original fix secured only the first link (stap server -> stap), but
the second link (stap -> make) was not fixed.  The -B option is not the
problem so much as an example of the problem.

I think Frank will agree that this is not a new flaw, so the CVE
description should be changed to reflect that.

The -B option is not
the problem so much as an example of the problem.

Upstream's bug report has links to the two patches that solve the
remaining unfixed bits of CVE-2009-4273 (#c10).

Thanks, and my apologies for the confusion on this.
