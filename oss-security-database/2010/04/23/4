Subject: CVE Request: cacti SQL injection in template_export

Hi,

On Wednesday an SQL injection issue was announced on Full Disclosure by
"Bonsai Information Security":
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Apr/272, quoting:
> A Vulnerability has been discovered in Cacti, which can be exploited by
> any user to conduct SQL Injection attacks. Input passed via the
> export_item_id parameter to templates_export.php script is not
> properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

Upstream has issued a patch for this issue:
http://www.cacti.net/downloads/patches/0.8.7e/sql_injection_template_export.patch
(but no new release yet)


thanks,
Thijs
