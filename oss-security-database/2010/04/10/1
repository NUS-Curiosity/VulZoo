Subject: CVE request: typo3 remote command execution

http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-sa-2010-008/

 The TYPO3 autoloader does not validate passed arguments.

You are not vulnerable if at least one of following conditions is met:

   1. You are using any other TYPO3 version than 4.3.0, 4.3.1 or 4.3.2 (+ 
development releases of 4.4 branch).
   2. You have at least one of following PHP configuration variables set to 
"off": register_globals ("off" by default, advised to be "off" in TYPO3 
Security Cookbook), allow_url_include ("off" by default) and allow_url_fopen 
("on" by default)
   3. You are using Suhosin and haven't put URL schemes in configuration 
variable "suhosin.executor.include.whitelist".

Possible Impact: A crafted request to a vulnerable TYPO3 installation will 
allow an attacker to load PHP code from an external server and to execute it 
on the TYPO3 installation.
