Steve,

I'm going to defer this one to MITRE.

On that note though, does someone have a Moodle contact, perhaps we could
get them to request CVE ids in private before a release, to avoid the
backlog that results.

The same holds for things like typo3, that seem to often have lots of flaws
all at once.

Thanks.
