This is a bit more than what it appears.

The SSL commit is here:

It fixes the old "does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain
name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field" flaw, plus also verifies that
the server being connected to is the one listed in the certificate.

Let's assign these as such:
CVE-2010-1154 irssi 0.8.15 /0 in CN field
CVE-2010-1155 irssi 0.8.15 certificate host validation

The crash bits mentioned in the changelog are very ambiguous. The git tree
isn't any more clear than that. There appear to be two crashes, both sound
like NULL pointer dereferences that cannot be triggered by an attacker. If
I'm wrong, please speak up.
