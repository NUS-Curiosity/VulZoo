Hi Hui,

Just FYI, oss-security is a public mailing list. I noticed you have 
already cc'ed the KGDB maintainer. If you are trying to report a kernel 
security issue that is neither fixed not disclosed previously AFAIK, you 
might want to try CC'ing security@...nel.org and LKML. Drop LKML if you 
want to keep it private for a short period of time.

Thanks, Eugene
