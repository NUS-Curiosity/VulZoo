Subject: CVE request - Linux Kernel KGDB/ppc issue

Hi All,

The problem is that if KGDB is enabled on a powerpc board, a
test that checks if a page is user or kernel is bypassed.
This means that a user can write to arbitrary kernel address space.

Upon further investigation, we found that kernels older than
the v2.6.30-rc1 release have the same problem for non-booke
ppc chips (74xx, 8641D), so we need two patches for kernels
up to that date, and then one patch for ones after that date.

Thanks,
Hui
