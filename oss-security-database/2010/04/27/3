FYI. We use v2.6.25.20 in one of our products. As far as I see from
include/linux/tty.h in 2.6.25 archive that pgrp member in tty_struct is already converted
to "struct pid". I haven't checked the older kernel releases but this
issue exists in 2.6.25. It would be very helpful if someone checked
older kernel releases to correctly determine which releases are vulnerable.
