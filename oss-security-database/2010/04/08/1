Subject: Re: ClamAV small issues

These are certainly worth of CVE ids, but it's going to be tricky, as the
first issue is a couple of things as seen in the bug:
https://wwws.clamav.net/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1826

I'm going to defer this assignment to MITRE (added Steve Christey to the CC).

Thanks.
