Subject: [PATCH 3/3] execve: make responsive to SIGKILL with large arguments

An execve with a very large total of argument/environment strings
can take a really long time in the execve system call.  It runs
uninterruptibly to count and copy all the strings.  This change
makes it abort the exec quickly if sent a SIGKILL.

Note that this is the conservative change, to interrupt only for
SIGKILL, by using fatal_signal_pending().  It would be perfectly
correct semantics to let any signal interrupt the string-copying in
execve, i.e. use signal_pending() instead of fatal_signal_pending().
We'll save that change for later, since it could have user-visible
consequences, such as having a timer set too quickly make it so that
an execve can never complete, though it always happened to work before.
