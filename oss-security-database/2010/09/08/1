Subject: [PATCH 0/3] execve argument-copying fixes

This is my take on parts of the execve large arguments copying issues
that Kees posted about, and Brad and others have been discussing.
I've only looked at the narrow area of the argument copying code
itself.  I think these are good and necessary fixes.  But I'm not
addressing the whole OOM killer/mm accounting issue, which also needs
to be fixed (and I have the impression others are already looking into that).

The following changes since commit d56557af19867edb8c0e96f8e26399698a08857f:

  Merge branch 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jbarnes/pci-2.6 (2010-09-07 16:00:17 -0700)

are available in the git repository at:

  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/frob/linux-2.6-roland.git topic/exec-fixes

Roland McGrath (3):
      setup_arg_pages: diagnose excessive argument size
      execve: improve interactivity with large arguments
      execve: make responsive to SIGKILL with large arguments
