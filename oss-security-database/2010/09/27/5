Oh, hang on.  Re-read some older messages again trying to grok this and
it looks like these checks were introduced in 1.1.2, so they would _not_
affect earlier versions if I'm understanding correctly.

So only 3316 and the second issue without a CVE name affect pre-1.1.2.

So what about previous versions that _don't_ have privilege switching in
pam_env and pam_mail?  Would that require yet another CVE or would the
addition of privilege switching be considered an enhancement, not a
security fix?
