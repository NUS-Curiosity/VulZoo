No, they are not fully fixed at all.  We're working on a patch (so you
don't need to).  The commit has the mentioned partial fixes only.

This is the same question asked different ways.  We have a patch that
we're reviewing internally.  To be made available soon.

The original pam_env and pam_mail issues, yes.  The partial fixes, no,
because there were no fixes at all before 1.1.2.

They're relatively minor because these modules are normally not used.
However, if the modules are used in a PAM stack on a given install, then
the original issues reported against pam_env and pam_mail by Sebastian
become major ones.

Additionally, as mentioned by Sebastian, pam_env's intended behavior is
a security risk (user-provided env vars may affect some services in ways
not expected by the sysadmin).  I am not sure how to deal with that.
Maybe improve the documentation.
