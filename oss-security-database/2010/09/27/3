If we look back to CVE-2009-2408, similar bug was fixed at that time
without being handled as security flaw.  NSS used to allow '*' wildcard
to match more than one host name label, or even the whole name.  As
noted elsewhere in this thread, such wildcard handling can be found
elsewhere too, with fixes handled as security enhancements, rather than
security flaw fixes.
