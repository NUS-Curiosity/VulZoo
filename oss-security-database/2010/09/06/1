Jan,

Yes, the patch referenced in [F],  specifically changes to SSL_Cipher.cpp, were made in response to issues (1) & (2).  These are not backward compatible, and so only apply to new filesystems.

Issue (3) is not directly addressed.  A workaround is to enable per-block MAC headers, or per-block random bytes.  A patch going into 1.7.2 allows per-block random bytes to be configured independently of MAC headers.  It would be possible to change the default settings such that per-block random bytes are always used.

Adding new encryption modes is not planned for encfs 1.x.

regards,
Valient
