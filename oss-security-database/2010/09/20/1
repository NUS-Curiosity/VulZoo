Subject: CVE request: egroupware remote code and xss

http://www.egroupware.org/news?item=93

Nahuel Grisolia from CYBSEC S.A. Security Systems found two security
problems in EGroupware:

    one is a serious remote command execution (allowing to run arbitrary 
command on the web server by simply issuing a HTTP request!).
    the other a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

Here's the original advisory for both issues:
