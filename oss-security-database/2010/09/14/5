I was referring to the ways available to userland heretofore.  Certainly,
the kernel could add new ways and then userland could do different things
(with new kernels).  

auxv in particular is not a mechanism that could fit for this.  The actual
limit depends on rlimits of the calling process, and rlimits can change
during the life of the program.  auxv is only appropriate for things that
are known at the time of the exec and won't change thereafter.


Thanks,
Roland
