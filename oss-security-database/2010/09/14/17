I don't see how it could fail except for OOM cases where get_user_pages()
failed rather than blocking.  Is that what you mean?

I understand the motivation for an explicit mechanism for the kernel to
tell userland its limit.  Since the kernel policy today depends on
something that can change between execs, AT_ARGMAX is inadequate for
that purpose for today's policy, let alone any future different policy.

You mean documentation?  I'm not really sure if there is any for that.
But it's the inherent definition of auxv that all its information can
only be about the conditions at program startup.


Thanks,
