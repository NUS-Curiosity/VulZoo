Subject: CVE request: xss in pecl-apc before 3.1.4

http://pecl.php.net/package-changelog.php?package=APC&release=3.1.4

- Fixed potential XSS in apc.php (Pierre, Matt Chapman)

This is a minor issue as this usually doesn't get installed and should only be 
used for debugging-purposes, but still, deserves a CVE.
