Subject: [PATCH 2/4] Revert "oom: deprecate oom_adj tunable"

oom_adj is not only used for kernel knob, but also used for
application interface.
Then, adding new knob is no good reason to deprecate it.

Also, after former patch, oom_score_adj can't be used for setting
OOM_DISABLE. We need "echo -17 > /proc/<pid>/oom_adj" thing.

This reverts commit 51b1bd2ace1595b72956224deda349efa880b693.

-What:	/proc/<pid>/oom_adj
-When:	August 2012
-Why:	/proc/<pid>/oom_adj allows userspace to influence the oom killer's
-	badness heuristic used to determine which task to kill when the kernel
-	is out of memory.
-
-	The badness heuristic has since been rewritten since the introduction of
-	this tunable such that its meaning is deprecated.  The value was
-	implemented as a bitshift on a score generated by the badness()
-	function that did not have any precise units of measure.  With the
-	rewrite, the score is given as a proportion of available memory to the
-	task allocating pages, so using a bitshift which grows the score
-	exponentially is, thus, impossible to tune with fine granularity.
-
-	A much more powerful interface, /proc/<pid>/oom_score_adj, was
-	introduced with the oom killer rewrite that allows users to increase or
-	decrease the badness() score linearly.  This interface will replace
-	/proc/<pid>/oom_adj.
-
-	A warning will be emitted to the kernel log if an application uses this
-	deprecated interface.  After it is printed once, future warnings will be
-	suppressed until the kernel is rebooted.

 Caveat: when a parent task is selected, the oom killer will sacrifice any first
 generation children with seperate address spaces instead, if possible.  This
 avoids servers and important system daemons from being killed and loses the
