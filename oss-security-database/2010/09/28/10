Subject: Re: CVE Request -- MySQL v5.1.49 -- multiple DoS
 flaws


Sorry for the delay...

There are several issues of the same bug type, but based solely on the 
"Version" field in the associated MySQL bug IDs, it appears that each 
issue has a different set of affected (fixed?) versions.  So these all 
wind up being SPLIT from each other.
