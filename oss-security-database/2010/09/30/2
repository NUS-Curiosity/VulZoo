Subject: Small exposure in ocfs2 fast symlinks.

Hey Everyone,
	We just discovered that ocfs2 could walk off the end of fast
symlinks -- that is, symlinks that are stored directly in the inode
block.  ocfs2 terminates these with NUL characters, but a disk
corruption or an attacker with direct access to the ocfs2 disk could
overwrite the NUL.  Following the symlink via the filesystem would walk
off the end of the in-memory block buffer.  We're not sure how
exploitable this is, but I figured I'd provide a heads-up.  The fix is
in ocfs2's git tree and will be sent upstream tonight.  Erratas with the
fix are being built.
	If someone thinks we should have a CVE, please provide me with
the number.  Otherwise, just FYI.

Joel
