Additionally, CVE-2010-0463 (DNS prefetching) was resolved in IMP 4.3.8
and DIMP 1.1.5.

Finally, there is the Gollem XSS which just got CVE-2010-3447 from Josh.

This should now be the complete list of fixes in the latest Horde
updates (I hope). Josh, can you also assign CVEs to the rest of the
issues?

Thanks,
Alex
