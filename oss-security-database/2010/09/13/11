Personally, I don't see why slabinfo could represent a threat.
I'm regularly using it as a normal user just to check where all
my RAM is going from time to time. The more we restrict access to
harmless information, the more we'll have sudoers in the wild for
special users who need special accesses. And sudoers are generally
not as well managed as permissions, believe me ;-)
