Subject: Re: CVE request: epiphany not checking ssl certs


If an application does not advertise a security feature, then in general 
we will not give a CVE because of its absence of the feature (I don't want 
to give out 50,000 CVEs for every protocol that does cleartext 
transmission... or uses DES... etc.)  Similarly, we generally avoid 
assigning CVEs to "defense in depth" fixes, although the line between 
"vulnerability" and "defense in depth" can get fuzzy.

The http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=564690#5 title says 
"Does not longer check certificates" which could be interpreted to mean 
that it used to check certs, and now it doesn't.  If that's the case, then 
it makes sense to assign a CVE.
