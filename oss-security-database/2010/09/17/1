Subject: CVE request: pixelpost

Hi everyone,

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported against pixelpost:

1) A CSRF vulnerability allows changes to some settings (PoC allows changing 
the administrator's password.) [1]
2) SQL injection [2]
3) XSS [2]

2) and 3) are from 2009, so I guess we are going to need some help from 
Steven for those ones. The only information about those is [3] which has 
some other changes.

It also appears to be using PHP_SELF in some places, so that's another XSS 
vector. Will confirm it later.
