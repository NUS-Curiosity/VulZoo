That being said, it *might* be acceptable to obfuscate the kernel-side
addresses.  Still print them, but they're all zeroes.  I doubt if many
tools at all are actually using those.  Perhaps a runtime knob which
obfuscates those addresses for unprivileged users, something like that.

That also being said, I'm not seeing any kernel-side addresses in
slabinfo or zoneinfo anyway and I believe some distros already hide
kallsyms.  More specificity is needed.
