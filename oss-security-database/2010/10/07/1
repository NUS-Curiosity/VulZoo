Subject: Re: CVE request: multiple kernel stack memory disclosures

While these are pending, a few more of the same problem (uninitialized
structure members being copied back to userspace, leaking kernel stack
memory) have come up.  These are similar or related to the previous
ipc/sem.c leak.

ipc/shm.c (shmctl), reported and fixed by Kees Cook
Affects >= 2.6.0, >= 2.4.0

Reference:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/6/454


ipc/compat.c (compat versions of semctl, shmctl, and msgctl)
Affects >= 2.6.8

ipc/compat_mq (compat versions of mq_open and mq_getsetattr)
Affects >= 2.6.8

Reference:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/10/6/492
