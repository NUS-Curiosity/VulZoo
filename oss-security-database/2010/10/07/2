Did you use any specific way to identify all these?  From a quick look
at a few randomly chosen patches, there seem to be cases where one call
was fixed, other left unchanged.  That's only for the code visible in
the context diff.

There are few incorrect fixes too:

-  g_snprintf (gev.data.b, sizeof (gev.data.b), message);
+  g_snprintf (gev.data.b, sizeof (gev.data.b), message, "%s");
