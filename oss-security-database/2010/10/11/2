Can I get 2009 CVE-identifier for this issue: 

http://secunia.com/advisories/37557

Description: "Some vulnerabilities have been discovered in Simple
Machines Forum, which can be exploited by malicious users and malicious
people to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks.

The application allows users to perform certain actions via HTTP
requests without performing any validity checks to verify the request.
This can be exploited to e.g. perform certain administrative actions
when a logged-in user visits a malicious site.

Successful exploitation allows e.g. to delete package servers, conduct
script insertion attacks via censor lists and package manager, and
execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading arbitrary modules, but requires
a valid user account."

Versions affected: "The vulnerabilities are confirmed in version 1.1.10.
Other versions may also be affected."

Solution: "Update to version 1.1.11", which is the newest at the moment.
