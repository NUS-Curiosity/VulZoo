I'm going to give this four. We can split the XSS and remote file
disclosure later if it's found they affect different versions.

CVE-2010-3714 typo3-sa-2010-20 Multiple Remote File Disclosure
CVE-2010-3715 typo3-sa-2010-20 Multiple XSS
CVE-2010-3716 typo3-sa-2010-20 Privilege Escalation
CVE-2010-3717 typo3-sa-2010-20 DoS

Thanks.
