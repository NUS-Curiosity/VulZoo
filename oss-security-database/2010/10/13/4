Subject: Re: CVE Request -- cURL / mingw32-cURL -- Did not
 strip directory parts separated by backslashes, when downloading files

Hi Steve,

   just small correction. As stated in:
   [1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=642642#c4

the mingw32-curl package is not affected by this issue, as the
error is only present in curl command line tool and that tool
is not bundled in the final compiled form of mingw32-curl rpm.

So the CVE request applies really only to native systems, using
backslash as directory entries delimiter / separator.

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
