While we're at it...

"A buffer in the code which handles user authorization is copied without
sufficient length checks, causing a buffer overflow.
This bug happens BEFORE the user is online. In other words: even if you
have a password protected server, or only allow certain ip/hosts in,
and you use allow::options::noident, then this bug can still be
triggered."

The issue affects versions <3.2.8.1

I think this issue doesn't have a CVE yet either. (CVE-2009-*)

Thanks,
Alex
