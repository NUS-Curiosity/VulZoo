Subject: prewikka permission bug

Hi,

I couldn't find a CVE for this:

"The permissions on the prewikka.conf file are world readable and
contain the sql database password used by prewikka. This update makes it
readable just by the apache group."

Redhat and Gentoo were affected, I'm not sure about others.
