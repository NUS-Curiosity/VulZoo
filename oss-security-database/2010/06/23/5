Subject: CVE Request -- mlmmj -- Directory traversal flaw by editing and saving
 list entries via php-admin web interface

Hi Steve, vendors,

   Florian Streibelt (yet in 2009) reported:
   [1] http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=259968#c0

   a directory traversal flaw in the way mlmmj (Mailing List Managing Made
   Joyful), mailing list manager, processed users requests to edit and save
   list entries, originating from php-admin web interface. A remote,
   authenticated attacker could use these flaws to alter integrity of the system
   (write and / or delete arbitrary files) by providing a specially-crafted list
   variable content to the edit or save request.

   Florian, please correct me, if I mangled the attack scenario, and it's slightly
   different.

   Martin, Morten, are these two issues known upstream yet? Is there a patch for them already?

   Steve, could you please allocate two CVE-2009-XXXX CVE ids?
   (One for 1, 'edit' case, second for 2, 'save' case.) [Searching "Master Copy of CVE" for "mlmmj"
    keyword returned nothing for me.]
