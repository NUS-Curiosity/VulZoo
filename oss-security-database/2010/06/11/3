Subject: CVE request - kernel: btrfs: prevent users from setting ACLs on files 
	they do not own

Shi Weihua discovered that btrfs did not check ownership of files
before setting ACLs, allowing any user to set ACLs for any file,
completely bypassing all file permissions.  This wasn't reported as a
security issue, but it seems pretty serious to me (for those who use
btrfs).  See http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/5/17/544 for his original post.
