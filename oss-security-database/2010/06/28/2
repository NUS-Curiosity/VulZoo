Subject: CVE Request -- libpng v1.4.3 and v1.2.44 -- memory leak while processing
 PNG image with malformed sCAL chunks

Hi Steve, vendors,

   libpng upstream has released latest v1.4.3 and v1.2.44 versions, addressing two
security issues:
[a], out-of-bounds write to memory -- this already got a CVE id of "CVE-2010-1205",
[b], memory-leak bug, involving images with malformed sCAL chunks, which could
    lead to an application crash.

References:

Steve, could you allocate a CVE id for the [b] issue?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
