At a low level of granularity, it can be overkill to distinguish between 
closely-related flaw types.

The factor of concern here is that Red Hat bug 598775 suggests that the 
first variant was committed to a changeset, but not the second.  I can't 
(quickly) assess whether upstream committed changes for both variants, but 
if there's only a commit for the first one (and a public release), then 
maybe we consider these bugs as "almost-but-not-quite the same version" 
and assign a separate CVE.

We also use time lag between disclosures as a splitter, but these were 
more-or-less within a 24-hour period, which we typically treat as "same 
day."

This is fuzzy on both vuln type and version... I defer to others who can 
shed more insight on the question of whether these versions are different 
enough.
