Subject: Re: SFCB vulnerabilities


FYI, there have been plenty of other bugs inside sblim-sfcb, including
format string vulns in mlogf(). Dunno when they fixed that upstream,
but our sblim did that in 2008.
Unfortunally they seem to re-introduce these bugs in other sblims
like sblim-gather. Did you look at that too?

> SBLIM SFCB is an Open Source implementation of a WBEM CIM broker. WBEM is a set of technologies aimed to monitor and administer (larges) pools of computing ressources, applications, hardware. It's used by computers management tools like HP Systems Insight Manager, VMware vSphere or IBM Director. SFCB usually listens on TCP ports 5988 (HTTP) or 5989 (HTTPS) and is used in many Linux distributions and some VMware / Dell products.

By sending a small value in the Content-Length header and more data in the POST body, it's possible to overflow the previously allocated heap buffer.

Then, memcpy tries to copy the user-provided POST data in this buffer. By sending a value between UINT_MAX-7 and UINT_MAX-1, it is possible to overflow a buffer of size 1 to 7.
