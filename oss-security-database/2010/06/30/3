Subject: CVE request: HTML Purifier

Hi,

HTML Purifier 4.1.1 fixes an IE-specific XSS vulnerability.

Upstream announcement:
http://htmlpurifier.org/news/2010/0531-4.1.1-released

Fix:
http://repo.or.cz/w/htmlpurifier.git/commit/d3abcb90e30592c619047d878cf9c72b7c5836a3

This one is required for the fix to apply (the change is overwritten by the 
fix):
http://repo.or.cz/w/htmlpurifier.git/commit/da94d3d6acdf417ac890426eb1fd239ba62b042d

Could a CVE id be assigned?

Thanks in advance.
