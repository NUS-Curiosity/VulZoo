Subject: CVE request for browser IFRAME/file download DoS

Denial of service in various browsers:

http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Jul/69

Basically it opens a lot of iframes that point to a file download/run
location, you get endlessly spammed with run/save/cancel, in the case
of affected web browsers they become non-responsive and you need to
kill them using task manager/etc.

Affected
Firefox 3.6.4
IE 8
Safari 5.0 (7533.16)

Not affected:
Chrome 5/6
Opera 10
