Subject: Re: CVE request: ghostscript

Perhaps they're not identical, but they certainly seem related.  I
noticed that the upstream patch is for "psi/iscan.c", which is where
the overflow for CVE-2010-1869 takes place, and both appear to be due
to the same trivial case of long PostScript/PDF identifiers.  In this
case, the overflow appears to occur in the conversion of a PDF to a
PostScript file.
