Subject: CVE request: moin multiple XSS

Hi,

Multiple XSS vulnerabilities have been reported in moin.

References:
http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinBugs/1.9.2UnescapedInputForThemeAddMsg
http://bugs.debian.org/584809

Could a CVE be assigned?

Note that the original bug report only covered PageEditor.py, while upstream 
fixed multiple others at the same time. Not sure if you want to assign two 
different ids.
