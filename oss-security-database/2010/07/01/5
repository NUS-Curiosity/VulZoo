Subject: Re: CVE requests: LibTIFF


Below are some more CVEs from the additional work of one of our analysts 
on this nasty wasty thread.  (Josh, notice the RHEL one).

For CVE, we will typically cover client-side crashers, although many don't 
think those are important enough unless there's evidence of a possibility 
of code execution or some broader problem.  For OSS vendors, I have kind 
of an unspoken, informal agreement that they might not assign CVEs to 
crashers, but we might do so after they get published.

With a library, though, you don't know what that crash is going to affect, 
because it depends on what software is using the library - it could be an 
image server, web spider, cron job, etc. for which a crash has worse 
consequences than just inconvenience.  So, crashers in libraries are 
especially deserving of a CVE.

Personally, I also think that any client that can support multiple 
"sessions" at the same time should also treat crashers as a security 
issue.  e.g. in a web browser, someone may be surfing multiple web pages, 
or in an IRC client, particpating in multiple chats.  An attacker from one 
"thread" could cause a DoS to all other threads.  Technically, IMO, this 
violates a security model in which only the endpoints of a communication 
channel have the "privilege" to close that channel... even if it's really 
low priority for most people.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2010-2595
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2595
Reference: CONFIRM:http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2208
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=583081

The TIFFYCbCrtoRGB function in LibTIFF 3.9.0 and 3.9.2, as used in
ImageMagick, does not properly handle invalid ReferenceBlackWhite
values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(application crash) via a crafted TIFF image that triggers an array
index error, related to "downsampled OJPEG input."


======================================================
Name: CVE-2010-2596
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2596
Reference: CONFIRM:http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2209
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=583081

The OJPEGPostDecode function in tif_ojpeg.c in LibTIFF 3.9.0 and
3.9.2, as used in tiff2ps, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (assertion failure and application exit) via a crafted TIFF
image, related to "downsampled OJPEG input."


======================================================
Name: CVE-2010-2597
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2597
Reference: CONFIRM:http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2215
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/593067
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=583081
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=603703

The TIFFVStripSize function in tif_strip.c in LibTIFF 3.9.0 and 3.9.2
makes incorrect calls to the TIFFGetField function, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via
a crafted TIFF image, related to "downsampled OJPEG input" and
possibly related to a compiler optimization that triggers a
divide-by-zero error.


======================================================
Name: CVE-2010-2598
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-2598
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=583081

LibTIFF in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3 on x86_64 platforms, as
used in tiff2rgba, attempts to process image data even when the
required compression functionality is not configured, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted TIFF
image, related to "downsampled OJPEG input."
