I spy three flaws:

    A data leakage vulnerability was discovered, affecting MediaWiki 1.8
    and later. Public caching headers were incorrectly set on API
    responses containing private data. By means of a CSRF-style attack,
    this can lead to the disclosure of various types of private data
    stored on a wiki. All users are advised to upgrade. Full details can
    be found at:

Use CVE-2010-2787


    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in
    profileinfo.php. The vulnerability is only exposed when the script is
    explicitly enabled in LocalSettings.php, with $wgEnableProfileInfo = true.

Use CVE-2010-2788

    A register_globals arbitrary inclusion vulnerability was discovered in
    the 1.16 beta release series, in MediaWikiParserTest.php. This
    vulnerability does not affect any stable MediaWiki release. It only
    affects wikis which have PHP's register_globals feature enabled,
    despite our strong advice to the contrary. Apache installations with
    AllowOverride enabled may be protected against this vulnerability,
    since there is a .htaccess file with "Deny from all" in the relevant path.

Use CVE-2010-2789

Thank.
