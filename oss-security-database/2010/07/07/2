This security issue only affects the 3.7 and 3.7.1 development
"snapshots" (basically, alpha/beta quality). It's highly unlikely that
any distro would be tracking this unstable version/branch, so is a CVE
really required? If so, Mozilla can assign one from its pool.

I usually deal with getting CVEs assigned for Bugzilla issues, and I
just didn't think this one required one... However, maybe I was
mistaken in that.
