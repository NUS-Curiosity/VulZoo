Subject: patch for remote buffer overflows and local message spoofing in mipv6 daemon

Hi,

I tried this 2 years ago on vendor-sec and with the maintainers
at that time w/o success. I polished the patch to fit in the current commit.
The bugs were not fixed during the two years.
Can someone assign CVE(s)?

Sebastian
