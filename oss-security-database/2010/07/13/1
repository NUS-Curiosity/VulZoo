Subject: CVE request, php var_export

hi,

I would like to request a new # for a flaw in php's var_export. The
reason is that a fatal error occurs due to recursion, memory limit or
execution time var_export bails out. The buffer is never cleared and
it flushes to the user. It's not affected by display_errors() since
its considered part of the output.

Fix already commited to trunk, 5.2 and 5.3 and will be in the next PHP
releases (5.2.14 and 5.3.3):

http://svn.php.net/viewvc?view=revision&revision=301143

Cheers,
--
