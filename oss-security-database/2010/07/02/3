Subject: CVE Request -- Roundup: XSS by processing PageTemplate template for
 a named page

Hi Steve, vendors,

   A deficiency was found in the way Roundup, simple and flexible issue-tracking system,
processed PageTemplate templates for named pages. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by tricking
a local, authenticated user into visiting a specially-crafted web page.

Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
