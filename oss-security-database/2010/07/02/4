Hey Jan,

I have not debugged the problem because I contacted directly the author
immediately after the finding, so the following are his words in reply
to the report of this specific bug:

"The second seems to be a .. "feature" of SQLite; it bails if you have 
too many almost-but-not-really-utf8 chars in a 'like' query. We can 
probably add a workaround for that."

So the problem "seems" to be caused by SQLite but should be necessary to
see in its manual if there are references about limitations that the
developers should respect or something else.


BYEZ
