Subject: CVE Request -- Xfig: Stack-based buffer overflow by processing FIG
 image with crafted color definition

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   the Team of Underground Stockholm researchers reported:
   [1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=657981

   i.e:

   A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in
   the way Xfig processed certain FIG images. A remote
   attacker could create a FIG image with specially-crafted
   color definition, and trick the local, unsuspecting
   user into opening it, which could lead to xfig executable
   crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with
   the privileges of the user running the executable.

   Public PoC:
   [2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=463393

   Flaw severity note:
   On systems with compile time buffer checks (FORTIFY_SOURCE)
   feature enabled, the impact of this flaw is mitigated to
   be only crash.

Could you allocate CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
