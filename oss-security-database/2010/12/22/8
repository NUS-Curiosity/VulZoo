You're not being dim.  On Linux, mounting the file system with noexec prevents 
the kernel mmap()ing the pages with execute permissions.  Removing the execute 
bit on a binary doesn't cause the same behaviour.  In the paper I was 
describing the general case.  This is something taviso or stealth mentioned to 
me too so I will update the paper to make this distinction clear.  Thanks for 
the feedback.
