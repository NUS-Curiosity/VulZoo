Subject: CVE request: libvirt when compiled with openvz support has a
 potential security hole

We were notified of a fix to upstream libvirt that plugs a potential
security hole (buffer overflow) via the OpenVZ support in libvirt.

Red Hat and Fedora do not ship libvirt with OpenVZ support enabled; I'm
not sure if other vendors do or not.

The patch was posted publicly today, and although it's a low impact
issue, probably needs a CVE name.

Thanks.
