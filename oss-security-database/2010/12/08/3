Subject: CVE request: kernel: bfa driver sysfs crash

The port data structure related to fc_host statistics collection is not
initialized. This causes system crash when reading the fc_host 
statistics. The fix is to initialize port structure during driver attach.

This can be triggered by reading the fc statistics files under
/sys/class/fc_host/host#/statistics.

A bfa adapter must be present in the system for the problem to occur.
