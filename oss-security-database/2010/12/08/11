Thanks Eugene.

After some further looking at this, I'd like to retract the request for
a CVE name as premature.  This is not a security issue because the
output strings from vzlist are fixed.  So it would need to be
compromised in some way (fake binary, etc.) before it could cause any
problems for libvirt, at which point you have a bigger problem on your
hands.

Since libvirt is calling vzlist with hard-coded parameters as well, it
is not feasible to have "garbage" returned that could cause this
overflow in libvirt.

Sorry for the noise; please don't assign a CVE name to this issue (bug).

Thanks!
