Subject: CVE Request -- OfflineIMAP -- 1), failed to validate remote SSL server
 certificate 2), allows SSLv2 protocol

Hello Steve, vendors,

   two issues with security implications have been recently reported against OfflineIMAP:

   I), Didn't check SSL server certificate

   Description:
   OfflineIMAP prior commit:
   [1] https://github.com/nicolas33/offlineimap/commit/4f57b94e2333c37c5a7251fc88dfeda9bc0b226a

   did not perform SSL server certificate validation,
   even when "ssl = yes" option was specified in the
   configuration file. If an attacker was able to get
   a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a
   Certificate Authority trusted by OfflineIMAP,
   the attacker could use the certificate during a
   man-in-the-middle attack and potentially confuse
   OfflineIMAP into accepting it by mistake.

   II), Allows SSLv2 protocol

   Description:
   In commit:
   [4] https://github.com/nicolas33/offlineimap/commit/4f57b94e2333c37c5a7251fc88dfeda9bc0b226a

   when SSL server certificate validation support was added
   to OfflineIMAP it was still possible to use SSL v2 protocol
   version. Version 2 of SSL protocol version is known
   to be prone to multiple deficiencies, each of them
   having security implications (to mention some of them):
   [5] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer#Security

   Thus SSLv2 protocol version should be disabled in OfflineIMAP.

Could you allocate CVE ids for these issues? (though opened for
discussion of any / none of them worthy of it)

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
