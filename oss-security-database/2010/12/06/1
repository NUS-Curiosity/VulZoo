Subject: CVE request: vanilla forums before 2.0.10, xss

Hi,

http://vanillaforums.org/discussion/13119/vanilla-2.0.10-released/p1

Two sound like security:
#
# Added SafeStyles configuration to prevent XSS linkjacking
# Patched potential linkbait vulnerability in dispatcher

(although I don't know what a linkbait vulnerability is, maybe someone wants 
to enlighten me)
