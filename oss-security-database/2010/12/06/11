Subject: Re: CVE request: vanilla forums before 2.0.10, xss

Use CVE-2010-4264 for the XSS. The commit is here:
https://github.com/vanillaforums/Garden/commit/4535a059e4e24ca11a2ef0b4d754f262398bcece

As for the "linkbait" issue, I have no clue. Nothing in git seems to
point at that.

Steve, does MITRE have a precedent for such a thing?

Thanks.
