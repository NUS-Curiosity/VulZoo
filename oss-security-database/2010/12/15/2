Any specific reason for recommending:

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-/path/to/app/lib}"

as a fix for:

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/app/lib

issue in 1.3.2?  It does not do the same thing the right way:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH= ; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-/path/to/app} ; echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/path/to/app

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/foo ; LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-/path/to/app} ; echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/foo

Maybe you want to suggest something like this instead:

  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:}/path/to/app
