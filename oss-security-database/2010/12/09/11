Not really - if all functions were fixed in the same version, then that's 
not "textbook" CVE but close enough.

The main drivers for my question were (a) were there any other issues that 
remain unfixed, and (b) in general we try to have the year portion of CVE 
IDs align with publication (except for year-crossing time frames like 
Dec/Jan).  In this case it might have been more reasonable to assign a 
1999 CVE, but the 2006 assignment isn't horrible either...
