Subject: CVE Request: OpenWebAnalytics < 1.2.4 - remote/local file inclusion vulnerability

I was searching OSVDB, and I see this one wasn't reported (and
presumably, not assigned a CVE).

Versions of OpenWebAnalytics prior to 1.2.4 are vulnerable to a
remote/local file inclusion attack.

OWA 1.2.4 was released March, 28, 2010
