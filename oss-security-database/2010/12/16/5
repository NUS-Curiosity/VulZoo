Replacing
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/dir/name

with
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-/dir/name}

changes semantics in a way that are not generally desirable: if I want to
append a directory to the search path, then the latter is not the way to
do it (because it doesn't change the path if the variable is already set).
Rather, I think you meant
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:}/dir/name

(no quotes are needed on the right hand side of the '=' sign, as the shell
doesn't word-split there).

On page 5, the footnotes have several markup errors resulting in weird PDF
output.

I suggest using the url package for nicer URL typesetting (in case you're
writing this with LaTeX) and the hyperref package with
\hypersetup{pdfborder={0 0 0}} for decent clickable links.

So much for a quick look.
Cheers,
Ralf
