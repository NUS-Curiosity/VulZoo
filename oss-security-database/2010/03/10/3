I've created the attached patch to fix that problem

The attached patch includes the patch from Debian. However, the
match_domain() function probably should be rewritten anyways I
guess. It matches patters such as 'foo.bar.*' which is rather weird.

libESMTP also uses the Common Name as fallback even if a dNSName in
subjectAltName is present but doesn't match. The Common Name should
be ignored in that case according to RFC2818.

The code to perform the checks is quite complicated with openSSL
and I'm not an expert so I'd be glad if someone could review the
patch. This really belongs into a library ...
