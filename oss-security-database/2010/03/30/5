Here's what I have:

   CVE-2010-0736 - XSS in view_queryform (lib/viewvc.py) in 1.1.x before
   1.1.4, and 1.0 before 1.0.10.  (Note that Vincent Danen assigned a CVE
   last week at http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/03/16/14)

   CVE-2010-0132 - Secunia-assigned; for "regular expression search" before
   1.0.11 / 1.1.5
