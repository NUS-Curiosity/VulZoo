I'm not clear on the role of ipv6 here.  The affected code is in 
ipv4/tcp_input.c and there's no mention of tcp_v6_conn_request() there.

I'm guessing this was fixed in Linux 2.6.20.

Arguably this could have been given a 2007 ID, but the patch didn't 
clearly label the problem as a security issue, so I will treat Eugene's 
request as the first widely-public disclosure - thus a 2010 date.

Use CVE-2010-1188
