Subject: [cansecwest] Advanced PHP Hacking



Hi,

I'd like to announce a Security Master's Dojo course during next
CanSecWest 2010 in Vancouver (March 22-26 2010).

Title: Advanced PHP Hacking (!)

PHP is a worldwide web language used by individuals as well as companies
(Facebook...). This session aims at providing a hands-on focused PHP
Hacking experience. After this course, you will really know how
attackers work and move through PHP hax0ring so that they can jump
deeper down to your networks.

*BONUS*
This training will end with a final amazing exercise through a step by
step live hacking simulation. It will help students at coming back to
offensive and defensive hands-on actions seen during the whole day,
thanks to this complete information warfare operation.

For further information, just check :

Register as soon as possible (!) and join us at Cansecwest 2010

See you soon in Vancouver for more PHP Hacking :)
