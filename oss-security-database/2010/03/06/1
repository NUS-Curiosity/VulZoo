Looks like the CVEs need to be updated -- they were assigned only for
WinAmp originally:

CVE-2009-3995:
http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2009-52/ "Impulse Tracker Instrument"
http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2009-53/ "Impulse Tracker Sample"

CVE-2009-3996:
http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2009-56/ "Ultratracker File"

Dyon, do you have any reproducers you could share to help distros get
libmidmod patched?

Thanks,

-Kees
