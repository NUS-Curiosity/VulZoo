It appears to be a different issue.

ClickHeat's primary developer denies this is a ClickHeat vulnerability:

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2916809&group_id=181196&atid=896225

And states that the vulnerability requires the attacker to already have
elevated privileges (application-level admin access in PMV).
