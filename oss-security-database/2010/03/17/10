Subject: CVE id request: ikiwiki

Hi,
"javascript insertion via svg uris

Ivan Shmakov pointed out that the htmlscrubber allowed data:image/* urls, 
including data:image/svg+xml. But svg can contain javascript, so that is 
unsafe."
http://ikiwiki.info/security/#index30h2

Can someone please assign a CVE id to this?

Cheers
Nico
