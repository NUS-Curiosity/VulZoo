Sorry, I misread your comment. I was under the impression you were
suggesting after this point, we don't approve any more conference postings.

If folks don't mind getting these, and there aren't too many, I won't
complain.

This is from when I was under the impression it's "no more conference
announcements".

I'll keep this in mind. Historically I just ignore moderation requests I
feel don't belong (although I also have been very busy lately and not
paying attention to the moderation queue, this is mostly over now, so I'll
keep an eye on things).

That seemed reasonable to me.

I think those headers bring up a good point. This is comparable to the old
days of cross posting to lots of gropus on usenet (for you young folks, it
was frowned upon). Perhaps we encourage messages DIRECTED at oss-security,
rather than shotgun announcements.

I think given our current lack of policy, we should probably approve such
messages, as I don't want to make the content based on if I'm grumpy or
annoyed at someone on a given day :)

So this list has a defined audience, the security minded citizens of Open
Source. I could see a couple possible announcement policies (not just for
conferences, this could apply for lots of stuff)

1) Approve them all. (we already have full-disclosure, we don't really need
    another)
2) Approve only things obviously tailored for the list. (this is a bit
    snobbish I admit)
3) Approve only things geared at Open Source. (I sort of like this one, but
    the line is REALLY fuzzy)
4) Approve posts from list memebers who've been on the list for > 1 month.
    (I suspect this is the best solution)


Perhaps something that falls backward through that list, stopping at #2. If
a post meets any of the conditions in #2, #3, or #4, it's in.

Thanks.
