Please don't think of it like this. Your reasoning is sound. It's a good
discussion to have, and especially good to have in public.

Please don't take this personally in any way, your message just happened to
be the one everyone paid attention to. We want to keep the list useful and
relevant, so discussing future things is most helpful.

Just think of all the PR the conference has just gotten :)

Thanks.
