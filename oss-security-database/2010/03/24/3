Subject: kernel: bluetooth: Fix kernel crash on L2CAP stress tests

Heads-up, I believe this fix addresses a security-relevant issue. See 
upstream commit c2c77ec8. It was introduced in commit f2fcfcd6 
(v2.6.32-rc1). I did not request a CVE name for this since it did not 
affect any of our supported Red Hat kernels.

If it affected your commercially supported kernel, please request a CVE 
name. Thanks.

Eugene
