Seems reasonable to skip the secondary issue brought up by Marcus.

What exactly is the DoS that happens here?

Use CVE-2010-1088 (note that this number is out of order)

Use CVE-2010-1086

I assume that nfs_wait_on_request() can be influenced by a non-root user 
to generate the interrupt that triggers the Ooops?

Use CVE-2010-1087

> 6) kernel: bluetooth: potential bad memory access with sysfs files

Use CVE-2010-1084 (notice how this number is out of order)


All of these will be filled in sometime Wednesday.
