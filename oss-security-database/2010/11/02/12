Duly noted, but I have something to say anyway ;-) From a CVE purist 
perspective, successful exploitation gets something more than what you can 
get with CAP_NET_RAW alone, thus there is a violation of the intended 
security model, no matter how small.  One exception that I sometimes 
wonder about is whether you already have chained privileges [1] (e.g. 
where legitimate use of privilege A can automatically get you privilege 
B), but that kind of thing sometimes makes me wonder why there are 2 
separate privileges in the first place.

So, it would be reasonable to have a CVE, even though its severity would 
be knocked way down because of the combination of the minor infoleak and 
requirements for already-high privileges.

I recognize that this approach is probably at odds with many developers 
who have to implement protection mechanisms related to privileges and 
access control.
