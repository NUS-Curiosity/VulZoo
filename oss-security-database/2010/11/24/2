Subject: CVE request: kernel: unix socket local dos

Reported by Vegard Nossum: "I found this program lying around on my 
laptop. It kills my box (2.6.35) instantly by consuming a lot of memory 
(allocated by the kernel, so the process doesn't get killed by the OOM 
killer). As far as I can tell, the memory isn't being freed when the 
program exits either. Maybe it will eventually get cleaned up the UNIX 
socket garbage collector thing, but in that case it doesn't get called 
quickly enough to save my machine at least."
