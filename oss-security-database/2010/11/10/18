Subject: CVE request: kernel: Multiple DoS issues in block layer

A series of fixes were committed to address several issues I reported
in the block layer.  These issues require the ability to send device
ioctls to a SCSI device, which is typically possible for users with
group 'cdrom' or similar.

1. Due to integer underflow and overflow issues when determining the
number of pages required for maliciously crafted I/O requests, a local
user could send a device ioctl that results in the sequential
allocation of a very large number of pages, causing the OOM killer to
be invoked and crashing the system:

2. By submitting certain I/O requests with 0 length, a local user
could cause a kernel panic:

In addition to the fixes for these identified issues, there were also
patches committed for improved sanity checking on I/O requests, and
checks to prevent integer overflows in heap allocation sizes.  In my
testing, I wasn't able to exploit these issues, so just FYI:
