Right, it's not just a matter of dropping setuid bits and adding fscaps;
these tools each need to be changed to understand fscaps and correctly drop
privs. Which is especially true for "mixed" environments where the code
could run _either_ as setuid or with fscaps. Building that logic into the
cap library (which ever one) is the plan, as I understand.

Yup, and Debian and Ubuntu have even further to go since their userspace
and package manager don't even handle xattrs. It would be nice if upstream
tar took the xattr patches. Steve, are there any plans to make that happen?
