Subject: NULL byte poisoning fix in php 5.3.4+

hi,

The problem describes here http://www.madirish.net/?article=436, in
http://bugs.php.net/39863 (and numerous other places) has been fixed
in PHP_5_3, targetting 5.3.4 (RC1 to be released today). It is a well
(old) known issue in PHP and I wonder if there is a CVE already for
it? If not I think having one could helpful. or?

Cheers,
