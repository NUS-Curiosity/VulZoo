Subject: CVE request for OpenTTD

Hi folks,

we, the OpenTTD developers, have identified a security vulnerability in
OpenTTD (an open source game with multiplayer). Would you be so kind as 
to allocate a CVE id for this issue?

The issue concerns a denial of service vulnerability in the form of 
reading and writing already freed memory. The first vulnerable version 
is 1.0.0, the upcoming 1.0.5 release will have the issue fixed.

Once a CVE id is allocated, the issue will be documented at
http://security.openttd.org/CVE-2010-xxxx

Thanks in advance,
Remko 'Rubidium' Bijker
