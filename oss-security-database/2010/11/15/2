Subject: CVE request: kernel: perf bug

Upstream commit dab5855 ("perf_counter: Add mmap event hooks to 
mprotect()") is fundamentally wrong as mprotect_fixup() can free 'vma' 
due to merging. Fix the problem by moving perf_event_mmap() hook to 
mprotect_fixup(). In certain scenario, a local, unprivileged user could 
use this flaw to trigger a denial of service.

Upstream commit:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=651671

PS: I thought I requested a CVE name for this already, but it turns out 
I did not.

Thanks, Eugene
