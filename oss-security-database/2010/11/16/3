Subject: Re: utf-8 security issue in php - 2 CVEs?

hi,

New fixes or improved fixes, even for known flaw, get new CVE #. I was
not sure about that a couple of months ago, but that's the answer I
got when I asked about the policy for such cases. I think it makes
even more sense in this particular flaw.

Cheers,
