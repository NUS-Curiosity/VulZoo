Fair enough - while the primary goal of my email was to bring about a
discussion of these issues, I can see how CVE assignments might
further the cause, so to speak.  Steve, what is your take on all this?

Thanks Mike.  One of the reasons I posted this here was that
previously, I felt as if I were fighting a one-man, futile battle
against the kernel devs.  It's obvious to me that plenty of people not
actively involved in kernel development who care about these kinds of
security issues, and it's those opinions I want to bring to the table.
