Subject: CVE request: uzbl before 2010.08.05: User-assisted execution of
 arbitrary commands caused by faulty default config

Please assign a CVE for the following issue:

"With shell code in hyperlinks on a page, one of the sample (uzbl-core)
resp. default (uzbl-browser) button bindings (binding for mousebutton2)
would execute this code. This commit fixes that issue.
Note that just upgrading your uzbl is not enough. If you have an
existing config, the change will not be automatically applied. So be
sure you have this change in your config."

Thanks,
Alex
