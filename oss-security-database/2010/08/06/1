Subject: CVE Request -- FreeType -- Memory corruption flaw by processing certain
 LWFN fonts

Hi Steve, vendors,

   A memory corruption flaw was found in the way FreeType font rendering engine
processed certain Adobe Type 1 Mac Font File (LWFN) fonts. An attacker
could use this flaw to create a specially-crafted font file that, when
opened, would cause an application linked against libfreetype to crash,
or, possibly execute arbitrary code.
