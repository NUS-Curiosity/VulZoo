Subject: [HITB-Announce] HITB2010 SIGNINT Sessions

Hack In The Box is proud to announce, a brand new lightning session
called HITB SIGINT (Signal Intelligence/Interrupt)! HITB SIGINT
sessions are designed to provide a quick 15 minute overview for
material and research that's up and coming - stuff that isn't quite
ready for the mainstream tracks of the conference but deserve a mention
nonetheless. Final year students who want to present their projects to
industry experts are also strongly encouraged to submit their papers.

These sessions are held during the conference coffee and lunch breaks.
The papers would be reviewed by the main CFP panel and student
submissions will be reviewed by the HITB Team. The best research paper
presented will be voted on by the audience. This session is strictly
meant for research papers that are at least 50% COMPLETE at the time of
submission.

What you get:

# Chance to present your research at an international conference
# Chance to get your research seen and reviewed by industry experts
# Full access to the conference on 13th-14th October 2010 worth MYR1299
# Best research as voted by the audience will be given ONE FREE training in HITB SecConf Malaysia 2011
# Best research will be uploaded to the HITB conference materials segment and mirrored through HITB affiliates
/ partners (Packetstorm, etc)

Submissions are due 1st October 2010. For further details, please see:
