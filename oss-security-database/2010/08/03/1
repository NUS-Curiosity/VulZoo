Subject: kernel: [PARISC] led.c - fix potential stack overflow in led_proc_write()

Ilja reported way back in Nov 2007. A writer to /proc/pdc/led(?) can 
cause the kernel to consume an unbounded amount of stack, and result in 
stack corruption.

If you need a CVE name, change the subject to indicate that. We are not 
requesting one as we do not support the PA-RISC architecture in our 
distribution.

Thanks, Eugene
