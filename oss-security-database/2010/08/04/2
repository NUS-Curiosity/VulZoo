Subject: Re: CVE-2010-2791: mod_proxy information leak affecting
 2.2.9 only


A subtle comment here.  Arguably, this is the same core bug and could have 
been merged into CVE-2010-2068, even though the versions are different. 
Effectively, you've got multiple independent "streams" of 2.2.x Apache - 
which vary by operating system - and there's no overlap between which 
"stream" is affected by CVE-2010-2791 versus the ones that are affected by 
CVE-2010-2068.  And there are no regression errors.  This general 
abstraction difficulty applies to most software that runs on multiple 
platforms, where each platform has slightly different up-to-date versions, 
or delays in fixes for some platforms versus others.  (You could extend 
the logic to how each distro maintains its own versions of common 
software...)

However, this is a fairly arcane point that demonstrates the difficulty of 
keeping CVE consistent with only a couple simple rules (split-by-vulntype 
and split-by-version), instead of getting mired in lots of exceptions.

As a practical matter, this is a fairly important distinction, and if we 
were to MERGE into CVE-2010-2068 and update the description, that might 
not be enough of a "signal" to sysadmins that they have to re-evaluate 
their security posture.  So I'm reluctantly OK with leaving CVE-2010-2791 
separate - but I don't want to set this up as a formal precedent for these 
kinds of abstraction choices for later disclosures.
