Subject: CVE Request [two ids] -- cabextract -- 1, Infinite loop in MS-ZIP
 and Quantum decoders (minor) 2, Integer wrap-around (crash) by processing
 certain *.cab files in test archive mode

Hi Steve, vendors,

   two security issues have been reported against cabextract:

1, Infinite loop in MS-ZIP and Quantum decoders (minor issue):

A deficiency has been reported in the way cabextract extracted
certain Cabinet (*.cab) files, using the MZ-ZIP and Quantum decompressors.
If a local user was tricked into opening a specially-crafted *.cab
file, it could lead to infinite loop.

2, Integer wrap-around (crash) by processing certain *.cab files in test archive mode

An integer wrap-around flaw has been reported in the way cabextract processed
certain Cabinet (*.cab) archive files. If a local user was tricked into opening
a specially-crafted *.cab archive in test archive mode, it could lead to cabextract
executable crash.
