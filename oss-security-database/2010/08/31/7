Subject: Re: CVE id request: libc fortify source information
 disclosure


I think this technically qualifies as an "exposure" which is the "E" in 
"CVE" - it can be used as a stepping stone for exploitation of another 
vulnerability.  (Very old, unwieldy definitions here: 
http://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html)

The risk may be very minimal, but the FORTIFY_SOURCE protection mechanism 
is not working "as advertised" - it can be manipulated for an 
admittedly-small information leak.

Use CVE-2010-3192 for the issue.
