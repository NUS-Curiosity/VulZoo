Subject: CVE request - kernel: integer overflow in ext4_ext_get_blocks()

This was reported by a customer. Integer overflow flaws were found in 
ext4_ext_in_cache() and ext4_ext_get_blocks(). We managed to triggered 
the case in ext4_ext_get_blocks() but did not attempt to try the other. 
This can trigger a BUG() on certain configuration of ext4 file systems.
