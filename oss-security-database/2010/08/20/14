Just to close this up.  I have actually preserved CVE-2010-2621 and have 
marked CVE-2010-2533 as a duplicate, which is contrary to what Vincent 
said.

MITRE is ultimately the authority on which CVE should be rejected when 
duplicates arise.  See 
http://cve.mitre.org/cve/editorial_policies/duplicates.html for the 
criteria that I generally follow (every once in a while, a behemoth 
"authoritative source" wins, though generally there is an expectation that 
their ID will become more ubiquitous in the future anyway.)
