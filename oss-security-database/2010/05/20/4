Subject: CVE Request for Horde and Squirrelmail

Hi,

Is there a CVE number available for the two 0-days exposed during Hack In
The Box Dubai 2010 ?

Though the exploits were not given during HITB (?), some friends have
recently shown me that they found how both products (Squirrelmail and Horde)
might be abused to be transformed, so that they become some kind of nmap
scanner (banner grab, port scan, etc). It helps at discovering a remote DMZ,
internal LAN, etc, by using those webmails as evil internal nmap proxies.

More info available on the slides of the corporate hackers who found the
0-days :

-> Squirrelmail: page 69 (post auth vuln)
-> Horde: page 74 (pre auth vuln)
