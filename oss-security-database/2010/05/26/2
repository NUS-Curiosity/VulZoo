Subject: CVE request - kernel: nfsd: fix vm overcommit crash

"knfsd crashes if you are using it to export shmemfs objects and run 
strict overcommit. In this situation the current->mm based modifier to 
the overcommit goes through a NULL pointer.

We could simply check for NULL and skip the modifier but we've caught 
other real bugs in the past from mm being NULL here - cases where we did 
need a valid mm set up (eg the exec bug in 2005).

To preserve the checks and get the logic we want shuffle the checking 
around and add a new helper to the vm_ security wrappers

Also fix a current->mm reference in nommu that should use the passed mm"
