Hi Max,

I don't believe there is a CVE number for this alleged "hack".

Additionally, we at the Horde project disagree entirely with the  
characterization that this is an exploit.  We have specifically warned  
users for *at least 7 YEARS* that allowing the test scripts to remain  
executable after using them is inadvisable (see  
http://git.horde.org/diff.php/horde/docs/SECURITY?r1=1.1&r2=1.2?rt=horde).  At  
a minimum, it is a bit disingenuous for security researchers to  
"announce" a exploit that is explicitly mentioned in the documentation  
shipped with the software package.

That being said, with framework changes that have already been made in  
Horde 4, test scripts are now globally disabled by default, which will  
help protect somewhat against lazy administrators.  Until then, for H3  
admins simply need to disable/restrict the test scripts as we have  
been telling them to do for years.
