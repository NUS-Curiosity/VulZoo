Either I mix something up or that option does not even help:

With the Debian lenny version I get:

$ touch gs_init.ps
$ /usr/bin/gs -P- notneeded.ps
GPL Ghostscript 8.62: Initialization file gs_init.ps does not begin with an integer.

indicating that the gs_init.ps is looked for in the current directory
even with -P-.

And that also seems to be executed:
$ ls doh
ls: cannot access doh: No such file or directory
$ cat gs_init.ps
862
(doh) (w) file
$ /usr/bin/gs -P-
$ ls doh
doh
