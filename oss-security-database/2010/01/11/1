Subject: FreeRadius 1.1.7 CVE-2009-4481 being duplicate of CVE-2009-3111

Hello Steve, Alan, Evgeny, vendors,

   this is due:

     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4481 being dupe CVE of
     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3111

This was already discussed here:
     http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/09/09/1
     http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/09/09/4
     http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/09/09/5

Alan has confirmed in his reply with Message ID: <4AA7EFB6.5070609@...eradius.org>
(you should have it in you mbox, oss-security wasn't Cc-ed there), that it is the
same issue, as mentioned on intervydis.com.

And also Evgeny was so kind and updated intevydis.com page [1] to reflect
CVE-2009-3111 for FreeRADIUS DoS:

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
