We (Debian) also contacted them and got a rather distracting reply so far 
which doesn't help much. We are thinking about informing our maintainers to 
check the upstream tarballs. But given the replies in the lwn thread and a 
look at git.berlios.de doesn't give the impression so far that anything has 
been fixed in a secure manner. I'll keep you updated but so far at least (and 
this is my personal opinion) it doesn't look to me like it would be a wise 
decision to host files at BerliOS currently and that BerliOS is interested to 
do what apache has been done.

Cheers
Nico
