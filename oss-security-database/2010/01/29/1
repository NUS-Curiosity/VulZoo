Subject: CVE Request -- ejabberd

Hi Josh, Steve, vendors,

   a remotely exploitable DoS from XMPP client to ejabberd server
via too many "client2server" messages (causing the message queue on
the server to get overloaded, leading to server crash) has been found:

   https://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-1173

Links to applied patches are in:

   https://support.process-one.net/browse/EJAB-1173;jsessionid=CC9A1D875A20197DD4571444DA8C1EFB?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Aall-tabpanel

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
