From the DSA text:

Christoph Anton Mitterer discovered that maildrop, a mail delivery agent
with filtering abilities, is prone to a privilege escalation issue that
grants a user root group privileges.


The issue occurs when invoking maildrop -d, which keeps the root group 
privileges on the mailbox rather than changing them to the users gid.
