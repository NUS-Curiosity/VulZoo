Hi,

We have almost 800 subscribers on oss-security, but DFN-CERT doesn't
appear to be subscribed - so I've re-added the CC on this reply, and
I'll over-quote a little.

This is not exactly the new vendor-sec.  As the name suggests, it is a
Linux distros only list.  Also, please note that the maximum acceptable
embargo period on this list is 14 days.  We need to communicate this
detail to whoever we're asking to disclose anything to the list, before
they disclose.  When posting to the list, you may encrypt messages to
the attached key.

For FreeRADIUS specifically, it sounds like non-Linux vendors could be
interested as well.  DFN-CERT did mention Linux distros specifically in
the quote above, so the suggestion to use the list was appropriate, but
perhaps requests from other distros shipping FreeRADIUS should be
accommodated as well.  If something like this arrived to the Linux
distros list without prior discussion on oss-security, I would bring
this up and suggest that we contact *BSD's at least.  Since this is
already on oss-security, I assume that interested *BSD's and others may
ask DFN-CERT themselves. ;-)
