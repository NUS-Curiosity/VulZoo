Interesting, I also looked at systemtap and found a local root
(CVE-2010-4170), but was under the impression we had agreed it should be
restricted to a privileged group?

I stopped looking because I concluded that had eliminated any security risk,
is that no longer the case?

(I dont have an up to date RHEL machine to check)
