Subject: Re: Apache symlink issue: can documented behavior be
 a security problem and hence get a CVE?


Very rarely, we will cover "documented behavior" if there is sufficient 
evidence of widespread abuse/misuse of that behavior by admins, in which 
case the CVE description would emphasize the fact that it is the admin's 
"fault" or "misconception."  I generally try to stay away from edge cases 
(such as this one) that could have a "snowball effect" of setting a 
precedent that could ultimately be used to argue for assigning too many 
low-priority CVEs to many issues.  I would be inclined to avoid assigning 
a CVE for this issue unless someone can provide a realistic, relatively 
common scenario under which this would pose a significant security 
problem.

Speaking of Apache, the well-known double-extension handling issue that 
enables arbitrary upload/execution of dangerous files like abc.php.gif 
also doesn't have a CVE [I don't think] for similar reasons, that it is 
well-documented behavior.
