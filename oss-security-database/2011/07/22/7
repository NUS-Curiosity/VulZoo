I think you are a tad off, here. The vulnerability I discovered actually
is only exploitable *by* a user with push access as it requires to push
a commit that renames any file to a file with a malicious file name.

The description (and the categorization of the vulnerability, which
definitely is a low severity one if it counts as a vulnerability at all)
should be corrected to reflect that.
