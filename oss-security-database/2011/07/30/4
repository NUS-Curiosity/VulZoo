Hello Moritz,

The patch we applied has been shared with Daniel Veillard of the libxml2 project.

We understand this issue may affect other distributors of libxml2, and we have not seen evidence that our patch has been applied upstream.  We do not feel it is prudent to share the patch on a public mailing list such as oss-security, as we do not wish to inadvertently facilitate exploitation of the issue if other distributors are affected.

We would like to cooperate with other downstream distributors of free and open source software on security issues, as Apple is a major distributor of such software.  However, our previous attempts to engage the community have not been successful.  One-way disclosure of information related to security issues subjects our customers to non-trivial risk without providing any added security benefit.  This is particularly pertinent if the disclosure were to occur in advance of the release of fixed software.

Best regards,
