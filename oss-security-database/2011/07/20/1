Looking at the above patches, there seems to be two issues here, perhaps
it needs two CVE ids to be assigned?

1. http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=31713

This one pertains to rand returning same values in forked processes.
http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/4338
This is a regression, as it was fixed in 1.8.6-p114, but re-appeared in
1.8.6-p399.

2. http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=32050

This is an issue in the securerandom.rb module.
http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/4579

Josh,

Can we please assign CVE-2011-2686 to one of the issues and have another
CVE id to the other issue?

Thanks.
