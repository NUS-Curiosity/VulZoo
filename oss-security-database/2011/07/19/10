Oops.

Yes, we're quite aware of that:

Thank you!

Please combine them.  I am not sure which name is better - please make
your own determination.  Somehow I expected to find pkgsrc under or near
NetBSD, despite of being aware of it being usable on other systems.

Sounds good.  Is anyone else interested in that as well?  Also, not
being involved with a *BSD, perhaps I should not be on that list, but
this brings up the issue of resolving administrative issues (e.g., not
being on the list I would not notice spam getting through to it).
