I've just described the new list and some of its policies in the newly
added "Linux distribution security contacts list" section at:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/vendor-sec

on multiple non-historical closed lists if we ever host several at once.
(Non-Linux lists may be setup if there's demand.)
