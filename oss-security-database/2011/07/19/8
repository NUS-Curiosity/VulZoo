We plan to make the issue public as soon as we have a CVE and can publish
our advisory. However, almost every detail of the vulnerability has been
already discussed on this list. 
(Summary: the status of the certificate will not be checked)

Thus, the patch does not reveal any further aspects of the vulnerability and
the only reason that we do not want to publish it publicly is that the fact
that it may be incomplete and/or introduce side effects because we do
not have a complete test environment.

Good idea.


p.s.
Please include us in CC since we are not subscribed on the list.
