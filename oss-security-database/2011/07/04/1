I'm not part of the group you directed this question too, but as I've
not seen any upstream developer or list in CC...

The fix from the paper was committed in openssl CVS within about a week
from public disclosure:

http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=20892

However, there were some concerns raised regarding the extra #ifdef
wrapping added as part of the commit, which disable the fix by default,
and the name suggests #ifndef was probably intended:
