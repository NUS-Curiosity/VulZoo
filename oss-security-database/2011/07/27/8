This sounds like a limitation of the Qt API, which can be avoided by 
programmers who are aware of the limitation.  Kind of like how strcpy() 
can be subject to buffer overflows, *if* the programmer isn't careful. 
Also happened with confusing return values from certain OpenSSL API 
functions a couple years ago.  (The PHP_SELF example is similar.)  So, 
this should probably get separate CVEs for each application/library that 
misuses the relevant function(s).

If Qt itself contains misuse of its own functions - which happens 
sometimes (CVE-2008-5077 for OpenSSL) - then Qt might need its own CVE, 
too.
