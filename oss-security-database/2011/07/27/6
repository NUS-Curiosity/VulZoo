I've not previously looked at the code more closely to find the exact
spot to be fixed.  However, I have successfully reproduced the issue
with busybox 1.15.1 at least, not sure if I looked at any older
version too.  It should be trivial to reproduce by running udhcpc -s
<script>, where script just dumps whole env.  You should see
server-provided options exported (hostname, domain).

Looks like fill_envp is the place:
http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/networking/udhcp/dhcpc.c#n341

The logic was little different in older versions:
http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/networking/udhcp/dhcpc.c?id=9ac5596a#n336

When I talked to upstream, they did see the issue and opened the bug:
https://bugs.busybox.net/show_bug.cgi?id=3979
