Subject: oCERT name change due to trademark claims


Hello oss-security,

to anyone that might be bothered with this change I'd just like to announce
that oCERT change its "long" name from Open Source Computer Emergency
Response Team to Open Source Computer Security Incident Response Team.

This change was triggered by legal claims by Carnegie Mellon University
linked to the fact that not only we need a license in order to use CERT in
our name (which we obtained in 2008 after the first claim) but that in order
to use the license it can never be implied that CERT is an acronym [1] for
Computer Emergency Response Team (this last claim was made just now in 2011).

Luckily we have better things to do with our time than engaging in possible
legal battles, therefore we decided to comply (the "long" name appeared only
twice on our site anyway).

To any OSS project that uses or will want to use CERT in this fashion, you
have been warned. I hope one day the security community can legally claim the
CERT acronym back without risking these kind of consequences.

Cheers
