Thanks for these patches. I was reviewing them and noticed that
0003-Avoid-blindly-source-SETUP_FILE-with.patch undoes the 
'error_if_not_basename $arg $val' for --save added in
0002-Ensure-that-save-only-saves-things-in-SESSION_DIR.patch such that
if you apply all 4 patches, method #2 from the Debian bug[1] is no
longer fixed. Attached is a patch to correct this (to be applied after
the other 4).
