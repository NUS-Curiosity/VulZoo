Subject: CVE request: Drupal Data-module multiple vulnerabilities

These issues does not have CVE-identifiers. Could we get one?

http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Feb/219

I asked from Justin Klein Keane and he wasn't aware of CVE-identifier. I think this needs identifier even this is an alpha release as this module is used by some production instances. If I am correct two identifiers should be enough. One for XSS and another for SQL injections.

Discussion about the issue: http://drupal.org/node/1056470

Best regards,
