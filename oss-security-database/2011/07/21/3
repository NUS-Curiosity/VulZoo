Subject: CVE Request -- libgssapi, libgssglue -- Ability to load untrusted
 configuration file, when loading GSS mechanisms and their definitions during
 initialization

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   this:
   [1] https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694598
   [2] 
http://lists.suse.com/opensuse-security-announce/2011-06/msg00013.html
   [3] http://lwn.net/Alerts/449415/
   [4] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=724005

doesn't seem to have CVE identifier yet (though Sebastian Krahmer
requested one for related fscaps issue).

Josh, Steve, could you allocate a CVE id for this?

[4] contains also further issue description + links to SUSE patches
(from [2]). Could not find their plaintext (*.src.rpm) version though.

So Sebastian, if you could share those with us, it would be appreciated.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
