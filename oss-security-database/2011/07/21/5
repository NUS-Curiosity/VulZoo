Somehow there are few *BSD security folks on oss-security.  In fact,
this was one of the things I considered when I decided to start with a
Linux-only closed list.

No, and they didn't ask for it.  I don't think they're on oss-security
either - I guess they're just not interested.

However, as you have seen from discussions on oss-security, the Oracle
person who formally joined for Oracle Linux is actually a Solaris person.
I find this weird.

Maybe, but I would like to see which projects/distros are actually
interested in being on such a list _and_ are on oss-security.  The
latter requirement is needed because it does not make much sense to
receive notifications of embargoed issues, yet miss notifications of
issues being made public without embargo.

Thank you for mentioning your preference - this is important info for me.

The effectively Linux-specific issues sometimes brought up on the list
are not limited to the kernel, though.

On the other hand, in those cases when someone brings up an issue that
is not Linux-specific, the reporter is not always willing to spend time
to notify the *BSD's even when asked to and pointed at the wiki page
with contacts.  Having a bsd-distros list that we could simply CC would
be helpful in such occasions.  But setting one up and subscribing *BSD
security contacts who expressed no interest in this kind of setup
(except for you) is weird.

You're welcome.

Thanks,
