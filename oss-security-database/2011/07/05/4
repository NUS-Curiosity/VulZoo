the official distribution site for vsftpd was compromised.

Maybe.  Do you have a copy of the backdoored tarball?  I don't, and no
one on forums where I saw this discussed appears to have it (which
confirms that it existed for a very short period of time only).

Not that I know of.

Are you trying to say that Debian got the backdoored copy?  This is news
to me.
