Thanks for your reply.

Since I also have other uses for my time, would anyone else investigate,
please?  I'd appreciate it.  Perhaps install FreeBSD 4.x into a VM.
Sounds like fun for someone who has time.

I don't think the bug is in OpenSSH per se, nor in FreeBSD 4's PAM (my
understanding is that it was cut-down Linux-PAM at the time, which was
replaced with OpenPAM in 5.x), nor in pam_opie.  libopie sounds more
plausible.  But I could be wrong.
