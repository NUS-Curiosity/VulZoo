I agree with everything up to here.

but this is rubbish. The heap gets overwritten with zeros which would
certainly lead to the application segfaulting. However, there is
no way for arbitrary code to be executed on amy sane OS with proper
memory protection.

Furthermore, Secunia when they contacted me about this said they would
release information about this vulernability on the 18th and then ended
up releasing it on the 12th instead which means I had to rush out the
release I was working on (and would have easily had ready for the
18th). That is not the way to win friends and influence people.
