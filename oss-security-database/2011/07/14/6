Well, you need to modify that in %post to automatically get 2y for
new passwords then. Which is kind of ugly as that's a file the admin
may have modified.

Anyways, we have the prefix configurable in /etc/default/password
too (CRYPT=blowfish). So no magic config file editing needed. The
programs parsing that file all do the blowfish=>2a mapping
themselves though as there is no lib unfortunately. So we have to
touch several packages to s/2a/2y/. That's what I meant with
"hard-coding".

Ok. Meanwhile I've found that libxcrypt's crypt_gensalt actually
also may change the prefix. It has a fallback to DES if the
requested prefix isn't available as plugin. So mkpasswd was broken
in that regard always. That error never happened though as mkpasswd
didn't support any prefix libxcrypt didn't support too.

Indeed.
