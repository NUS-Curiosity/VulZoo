Subject: CVE Request -- libsndfile -- Integer overflow by processing certain
 PAF files

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   an integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow flaw was
found in the way libsndfile, library for reading and writing of sound
files, processed certain PARIS Audio Format (PAF) audio files with
crafted count of channels in the PAF file header. A remote attacker
could provided a specially-crafted PAF audio file, which once opened by
a local, unsuspecting user in an application, linked against libsndfile,
could lead to that particular application crash (denial of service),
or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the
user running the application.
