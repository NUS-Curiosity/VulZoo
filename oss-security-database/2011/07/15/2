Subject: CVE-2009-4067 kernel: usb: buffer overflow in auerswald_probe()

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Auerswald
PBX/System Telephone usb driver implementation. There's no upstream
patch as the affected driver was removed from the kernel in 2.6.27.

(Attention Steve:) Looks like MITRE assigned this CVE to the reporter on
Nov 24, 2009, but did not update their CVE database entry for this since
then. Fortunately this is not a critical issue...
