Subject: CVE mistake in libsoup release notes

Upstream mistakenly used the wrong CVE name in the recent libsoup
releases.  They should have used CVE-2011-2524, but used CVE-2011-2054
instead.

I don't know who's pool CVE-2011-2054 might be in, but I would recommend
rejecting that CVE name and duping it against CVE-2011-2524.

I've seen both Gentoo and Novell reference the wrong CVE name in
bugzilla entries, so I thought I should bring this up.

See:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=720509#c15 and it's
follow-up comment from upstream (they've made the appropriate changes in
git now to reflect the correct CVE name).

So CVE-2011-2524 is the correct CVE, and CVE-2011-2054 is the _wrong_
CVE.

Thanks.
