Hi

You probably speak about:

http://www.suse.de/~krahmer/libs-vs-fscaps/

There was a discussion some months ago on OSS with more or less no result,
so we started fixing on our own.
The openssl patch has been posted to openssl patch list without results
so far either:

http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2532

Similar issues are inside libudev and libhal, both linked against
suids like Xorg.
