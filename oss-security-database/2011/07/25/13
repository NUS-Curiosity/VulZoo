Without disclosing too much, I'd go for a per module based CVE.  So one per 
affected KDE module + 1 per affected Qt module, + 1 per app that does its own 
thing (i.e. Arora, Rekonq and others we've already identified).  I think that's 
the most intelligent thing to do although I do think that one of the concerns 
is that more examples will likely come out of the woodwork (it's nothing that 
can easily be identified programatically) and each edge case is likely to be 
fairly application unique.  As an analogy, the best I can think of is XSS via 
PHP_SELF, do we give the CVE to PHP, frameworks that use PHP or individual 
apps that use it badly?  From what I can tell it seems to be per app/framework 
module.
