Subject: vsftpd download backdoored

Hi,

Here's a great example of why maintainers should sign their release
tarballs, why distributions should insist on that, and why they should
actually check the signatures indeed.

I think we should be referring to this when convincing people to do that
(I had moderate success so far - some projects started signing their
tarballs after my suggestions/requests, some did not).
