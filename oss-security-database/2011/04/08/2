Subject: CVE request for pithos information disclosure

Ian Daniher discovered that 'pithos' stores the username and password
for external services in plain text in a configuration file. This
configuration file is world-readable by defualt, resulting in a loss of
user privacy.

Reference: http://pad.lv/733307

Can I get a CVE identifier for this flaw?
