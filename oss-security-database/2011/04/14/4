Even though it's GPL'ed code, some vendors may not make their sources
publicly available to "random strangers" and rather only restrict them
to their customers.  Given the current context of this discussion,
public visibility of their source packages may not be better than the
visibility of their binary packages or "advisories" (whatever form you
expect them to be).
