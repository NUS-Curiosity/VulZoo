Thomas,

Thanks for the feedback. That kind of list is what I had hoped MV could
have created a year ago. Resources shot it down then and now MV has
added a few more issues to work through.

If SUSE's http://support.novell.com/security/cve/ is an example of what
is being sot to meet the public advisory requirement, then I know what
MV needs to do.

Mahalo,
Armin
