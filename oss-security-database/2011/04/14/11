Subject: CVE request: mediawiki 1.16.4, incomplete fix of CVE-2011-1578

Looks as though Mediawiki 1.16.3 did not fully fix the CVE-2011-1578
issue (XSS), so 1.16.4 has been released:

http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2011-April/000097.html

Could a CVE name get assigned to this?
