I think the whole point comes down to how can you prove you've updated what
you claim you have? It doesn't matter *what* is public, just as long as
something is (and it needs to be reasonable, expecting others to dig
through source would be silly). If someone is untrustworthy and using a
private list inappropriately, do you really think they're going to tell the
truth if they're asked about releasing timely updates? Clearly advisories
are the easiest way to verify this, but if someone has a better idea that
includes verifiable information, please speak up.

Thanks.
