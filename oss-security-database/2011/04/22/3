Subject: CVE request -- qemu-kvm: virtio-blk: heap buffer overflow caused by
 unaligned requests

"It was found that virtio-blk driver in qemu-kvm did not properly validate 
read and write requests from the guest. A privileged guest user could use
this flaw to cause heap corruption, causing the guest to crash (denial of
service) or, possibly, resulting in the privileged guest user escalating
their privileges on the host."
