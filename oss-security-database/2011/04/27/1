Dan, would you mind clarifying the way to achieve mtab corruption via
truncated left-over mtab.tmp file and multiple invocations?  After some
discussion with our util-linux maintainer, we fail to see an obvious
way.  util-linux opens mtab.tmp using "w" fopen open, i.e. using O_TRUNC
open flag.  So if there's any mtab.tmp file found, it's overwritten and
its existence does not block further use of mount / umount as existence
of mtab~ lock file does.

Thank you!
