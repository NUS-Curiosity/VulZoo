Subject: CVE Request -- perl -- lc(), uc() routines are laundering tainted
 data


Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   A security flaw was found in the way Perl performed
laundering of tainted data. A remote attacker could
use this flaw to bypass Perl TAINT mode protection
mechanism (leading to commands execution on dirty
arguments or file system access via contaminated
variables) via specially-crafted input provided
to the web application / CGI script.

Upstream bug report:
http://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=87336

Relevant patch:
http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commitdiff/539689e74a3bcb04d29e4cd9396de91a81045b99
(contains also information when the issue was introduced)

References:
[1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=692844

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
