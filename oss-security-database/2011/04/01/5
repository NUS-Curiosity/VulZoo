Subject: Closed list

Hello everyone,

This topic has lost focus lately. Rather than let it slip away, I think we
should go ahead with the simplest solution right now, we can always do
something different at a future date.

Openwall has graciously volunteered to run a new list, and they currently
have some infrastructure in place to do this. The new list can start up
right away. In this instance, I fear perfect is the enemy of the good. I'd
rather see something functional in place than nothing.

Here is the plan for initial membership (this is also approved by
Openwall).

Initial members will have had to be a vendor-sec member (no exploders this
time around). You must reply to this thread, in public (on oss-security).
We want this to be very public, we have nothing to hide. You must have a
public gpg key ID included in your reply. The new list will gpg encrypt all
mail (it does accept plaintext messages though).

Once we have an initial seed group, we can focus on future membership
ideas.

Thanks.
