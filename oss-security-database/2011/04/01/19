Subject: Re: Closed list

::Hello everyone,
::
::This topic has lost focus lately. Rather than let it slip away, I think we
::should go ahead with the simplest solution right now, we can always do
::something different at a future date.
::
::Openwall has graciously volunteered to run a new list, and they currently
::have some infrastructure in place to do this. The new list can start up
::right away. In this instance, I fear perfect is the enemy of the good. I'd
::rather see something functional in place than nothing.
::
::Here is the plan for initial membership (this is also approved by
::Openwall).
::
::Initial members will have had to be a vendor-sec member (no exploders this
::time around). You must reply to this thread, in public (on oss-security).
::We want this to be very public, we have nothing to hide. You must have a
::public gpg key ID included in your reply. The new list will gpg encrypt all
::mail (it does accept plaintext messages though).
