Subject: CVE Request -- atop: Symlink attacks via process accounting file


Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   atop v1.23 and earlier created process accounting file (/tmp/atop.d/atop.acct)
in an insecure way. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink
attacks (e.g. overwrite arbitrary system files).

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
