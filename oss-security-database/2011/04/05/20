Both FreeBSD and NetBSD have separate security teams that work to keep
the third-party software provided by the FreeBSD ports system
http://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html and NetBSD pkgsrc system
http://www.netbsd.org/docs/software/packages.html patched for
vulnerabilities.  (Note that the pkgsrc system is cross platform and
works on *BSD, Solaris, Linux and many other platforms.)  I'd guess
other BSD and Solaris distro's have similar teams.  I'd like to either
see members of these teams included, or a second list created for all
issues not specific to linux.  (FWIW I am on the pkgsrc security
team.)

I'll also second the question someone else posed about how cc'ing
others off the list could reasonably work if all messages are
encrypted.

Thanks,
