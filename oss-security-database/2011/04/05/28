I wish we had this discussion for real a month ago, but apparently most
folks won't comment until the setup of a closed list becomes a reality.
So I think there was some use in setting it up even if we end up re-doing
or removing it, which is within consideration. ;-)

There are also userland tools specific to the Linux kernel, there's
Linux-PAM, there are package managers that are rarely used on non-Linux.

I mostly agree with you, though.

Yes.

If it's not just Linux, then where do we draw the line?  Do we accept
Solaris distros (of which there are several), Haiku, ReactOS, Cygwin,
and who knows what else (no offense intended to any of these fine
projects)?  I think this would make leaks and misuse of the information
significantly more likely, and make some members and reporters
uncomfortable about posting to the list.  So we'll be back to CC lists.

I am comfortable about "Apple/FreeBSD/OpenBSD", but not about "etc." -
so we'd be forced to introduce a vouching system (well, maybe we'd be
forced to do that for Linux distros as well...)
