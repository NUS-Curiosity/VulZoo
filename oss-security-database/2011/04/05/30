That's usually how it works though, isn't it?  =)

Yes, of course.  There's SELinux, there's AppArmor, there's a whole mess
more, but there is still quite a bit of overlap.

I don't know.  Did we have them on vendor-sec in the past?  Not to say
that we want to setup a vendor-sec clone, but there obviously needs to
be some criteria for acceptance beyond whether they are a Linux distro.
I believe vendor-sec had a criteria list, and we could borrow from that
(activity from the project; a project that doesn't do security updates
or does them slowly/infrequently probably doesn't have a need for
vendor-sec).  Chances are if they weren't on the list before, they don't
need it either.

I think no matter how we define the line, someone is going to be
annoyed, and someone will think it's a "big boys club".  That's
unavoidable.  Maybe we need to worry less about individual project's
feelings and just state our criteria.  If they meet it, great.  If they
don't, then they need to work on it to get to a point where they meet
it.

I don't think that's unreasonable either.  My wife takes care of little
kids and she wouldn't have her job very long if she didn't take the
mandated first aid course.  As a parent, I wouldn't want her to have
that job if she didn't fit the pre-requisites (having first aid is
more than just useful/optional).  That doesn't make the job more
"elite".

Maybe if we think about things in these terms, and disclose the
requirements completely, then there is nothing for anyone to be upset
about.

Having said that, I do think trust is part of the equation.  I wouldn't
want Joe Distro on the list because they've existed for 2mos and have
put out a bunch of "security updates" without vetting their
trustworthiness.

"etc" more or less meant the other *BSDs, but I was being lazy.  =)
Maybe just NetBSD there.

I'm deliberately excluding Solaris because I have no idea how the whole
openSolaris thing works, but I imagine if they met the criteria (and
that would mean that Linux itself is _not_ one of the criteria), and
were vetted, then I wouldn't have a problem with it.
