Subject: CVE id request: tmux (debian specific)

Hey,
due to a patch that was introduced to our tmux package, tmux is not properly 
dropping group privileges anymore when invoked with -S (tmux is installed 
setgid).

Bug report: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=620304
Can I get a CVE id for this?

Cheers
Nico
