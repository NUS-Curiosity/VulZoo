I agree with Marc (and Marcus, Nico, et al). I was lucky enough to be on
vacation starting last Friday and 'missed my chance' to get signed up
before the others on my team.

While I'm not opposed to an initial stated limitation of 2 people per
vendor, I think perhaps the answer is simply what was initially stated
by Alexander: "For more than two persons per distro, the need has to be
explained". IMHO, I don't think that the vendors who have larger
security teams (and by extension larger software archives/numbers of
products) should necessarily have to arbitrarily limit their membership
to the new closed list.

While it would be possible for us to change our workflow to have only
two members on the list, in our case that:
 * would create extra work for those two people
 * would create opportunities for the non-members on our team to miss
important and time-sensitive emails in updates they are preparing (and
participating in the discussion). Eg, aforementioned vacation/sick or
being accidentally left out of a CC.
 * wouldn't (ultimately) limit access to the information to the other
members of the team

In that spirit, I am a member of the Ubuntu security team and was a
vendor-sec member via the Ubuntu exploder. In Ubuntu, the security team
rotates triage of new issues on a weekly basis and internally discusses
and assigns open issues to the different members of the team (I imagine
other vendors operate similarly). For me to adequately participate in
this triage and actively participate in discussions around embargoed
issues that I am tasked with fixing, I am requesting membership to the
new list.
