Messages from the list to members are always encrypted.  Messages to the
list are preferably encrypted, but this is not enforced.  (If a message
arrives to the list unencrypted, it is flagged as such in the encrypted
copies that are sent to members, so they're aware that the information
contained in the message is more likely to leak.)

So there are two ways to CC someone external:

1. Send the message to the list and to them unencrypted.

2. Send the message to both the list and the external address encrypted,
to their respective keys - e.g., GnuPG and Mutt support this just fine
(messages encrypted to more than one key).

The list currently does not propagate the To/CC headers to messages
arriving to members, though.  Maybe this is something to improve such
that discussions CC'ing someone external can be maintained.
