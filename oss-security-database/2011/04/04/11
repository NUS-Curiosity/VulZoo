Limiting a distro to two or three representatives is going to make things 
tricky for Red Hat; we have a rather large dedicated security response 
team (as we publish over 300 advisories a year across 70 product/versions 
and have a number of folks dealing with 'incoming' issues spread, and my 
team is dispersed across 9 different countries).  If these representatives 
have been very active on v-s and oss-security is there a reason to limit?
