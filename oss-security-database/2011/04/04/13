Same for Ubuntu. Limiting membership to two representatives would mean a
lot of email from the list is going to be forwarded to the other members
of our security team. Although limiting membership may seem like a good
idea to contain leaks, having to forward email to non-members because of
an arbitrary limitation would surely defeat that goal.
