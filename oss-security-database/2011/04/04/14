Same for Debian. We are currently cycling through a one week "front desk" 
period. Limiting that access to 2-3 people of the team would make that 
approach a bit unpractical for us in terms of handling undisclosed issues.
I also would welcome it if people who have been active on oss-sec and v-sec 
before should be allowed back to this list.

I can understand that you want to keep the list of subscribers low in order to 
prevent leaks. But from a practical point of view I see really no difference 
if a mail is passed to a team exploder of a distro by one of the allowed 
subscribers or directly sent to these members, at least in terms of attack 
surface/leaking risks. The only practical difference I see is who would be responsible
for such an incident. But if it's just about moving the responsibility out of
the list itself to the vendor while keeping the number of subscribers low you could as
well subscribe our team@ alias and encrypt mails with the team key.

That being said, my key data (I was added as part of Debian):
pub   1024D/73647CFF 2003-11-15
      Key fingerprint = FF46 E565 5CC1 E2E5 3F69  C739 1D87 E549 7364 7CFF

or alternatively a stronger key:
