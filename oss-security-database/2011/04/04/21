This would require that the private key (to decrypt the archive) be
stored on a server.  Then if the server is compromised, the intruder
will gain access not only to new list traffic, but also to archived but
not yet published postings.  Since the compromise _might_ be detected as
soon as on the same day (it depends), this might make a lot of a
difference (like, one day vs. one month worth of list traffic leaked).

I wouldn't mind running a script manually and entering a passphrase once
a month.  Of course, the script would need to be prepared first, which I
am not going to work on yet.  At this time, we're just discussing.

Hopefully, yes.

Computers are managed by humans anyway.
