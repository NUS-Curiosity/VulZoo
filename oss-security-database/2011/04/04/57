I think not, but Josh's message did not require that only Linux distros
request to be subscribed, so Jeffrey's request is reasonable in that
context.

I made the final determination to start with a Linux distros list only a
bit later.  Of course, it's wrong that Josh and I did not coordinate
this better off-list, which is a result of my lack of time during March.
