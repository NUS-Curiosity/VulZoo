This is something to consider with the new list as well.  Better to get
approval from all participants now.  No sense in taking on people who
are just going to "gum up the works" (sorry for the lame cliche, but I
couldn't think of a more succinct way to put it).

Also, completely unrelated to this particular thread, will you be adding
participants/keys to your wiki so people know who they can contact
securely if they do want to responsibly submit an issue?  A use case
may be that a researcher doesn't want to disclose an issue to the
entire list, but instead to a limited group that they feel is more
trusted. Such a feature would also alleviate the inadvertent disclosure
concern so you could add more participants to the overall list, since
it seems to be exploding.

Best wishes,
Mike
