Dan,

Thank you for your comments!  I had them in mind when I made the final
determination on the list that I've setup.

"Good" employers, let alone non-commercial Open Source projects, don't
remove e-mail addresses when a person leaves.  Someone having an
@debian.org address does not mean they're currently with Debian.

Yet I decided to allow some personal e-mail addresses for now, for the
reasons Mike has explained.  It takes me extra time to verify that a
person's non-vendor e-mail address is really "theirs", though.

Right.  So for now I setup a Linux distro security contacts list only,
as a hopefully better alternative to the long yet incomplete CC lists
that started to appear when vendor-sec ceased to exist.

Right, although I'm not sure about software vendors.  I think there's
usually just one non-distro software vendor for whom a given issue is
relevant (the upstream), so it can simply be CC'ed.  For example, on the
old vendor-sec we had X and Samba, and I don't recall any discussion in
which both participated at once.
