Tentatively subscribed (although Elliot reported an issue with list
messages arriving to him, which we'll try to figure out off-list).

Elliot - can you please post an URL with info on rPath Linux security
response?  I went to http://www.rpath.com but could not easily find
anything relevant.  There's an entry for rPath on the oss-security wiki:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors#rpath-inc

It has a link to the security-announce mailing list.  The archive has a
message in Feb 2011 ("kernel" update on 2011-02-07) and a message in Dec
2010 ("gnupg" update on 2010-12-06).  Nothing in Nov (but a bunch of
updates in Oct).  This gives us two security updates in 5 most recent
months.  Naturally, I am not convinced that you should be on the list,
but I'd be happy to be convinced once we start using the list.

Alexander
