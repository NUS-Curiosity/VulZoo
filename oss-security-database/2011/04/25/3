We included Mozilla in vendor-sec due to them being a large distributor of
open source software. Google certainly fits into this category these days
with things like Andriod and Chrome (both browser and OS).

I've been contacted by some Andriod folks in the past. They're keen to
start doing public advisories, most other Google projects already do this.

I suspect the real problem we'll hit with someone like Google is who to
subscribe. We could easily end up with hundreds of requests from a company
that size.

Thanks.
