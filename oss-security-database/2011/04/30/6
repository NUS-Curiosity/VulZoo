Does anyone in here know of an existing program to mass-decrypt all
PGP/MIME messages in an mbox file, resulting in another mbox file?
Note: the messages may contain multiple MIME parts.

Could this possibly be a script around Mutt (which includes PGP/MIME
handling)?

Suggestions are welcome (but let's not turn this into a lengthy thread
of its own).
