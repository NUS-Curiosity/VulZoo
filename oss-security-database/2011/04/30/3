Wind River is not yet being added to the new list:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/04/24/6

Hence, I've saved your subscription request to a separate folder, to
revisit it if a decision is made to start adding "closed" vendors to the
list, if Wind River starts to publish advisories and updates (in other
words, if it becomes no more closed than Red Hat), or if a suitable
separate list is setup.
