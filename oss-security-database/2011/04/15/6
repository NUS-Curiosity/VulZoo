Yeah, I don't think there's a way to ask Thunar to create a new file
from a template programmatically, so the user really needs to go to the
menu and create it.

Yeah hopefully, but I was more thinking on a way to detect the format
string error at compilation time. Manually it's kind of a pain as one
has to check every usage of a function using va_args.
