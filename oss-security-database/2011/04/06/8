Looks like you forgot to make this public key available.  Please provide
it to me and I'll subscribe you.

While we're at it, the MontaVista Software entry at:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors#montavista-software-llc

says: "The process for distribution of security advisories is currently
under discussion."  Perhaps this has already been discussed and decided
upon?  If so, please update the wiki page with specific link(s) to your
security advisories, updates, relevant mailing list archive - or
whatever you have.  Without this info, it is unclear whether you would
be making timely intended use of the advance notifications or not.

Thanks,

Alexander
