Subject: CVE Request -- dhcp: DoS (excessive CPU use) by opening an OMAPI
 connection


Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   A security flaw was found in the way DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
server processed remote connections when the dhcpd was configured to provide
Object Management API (OMAPI) capability. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to cause denial of service (excessive CPU use and dhcpd daemon unreachability).

Note: Though looks as minor / low severity issue, under proper configuration
       looks to be a way, how to get dhcpd completely unresponsive for further
       requests.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (though opened for discussion if this
being more to be a bug, than a real security issue).

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
