I went to http://www.project-mindstorm.net and I also did a Google
search on "Project-Mindstorm".  You do not appear to be a Linux distro
(nor any other distro, for that matter), so there's no reason for you to
be on the list that is being setup.  (Besides, we're initially
subscribing ex-vendor-sec members only, although this should change.)
