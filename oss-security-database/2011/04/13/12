Dan,

I personally want a public list but its more of an internal Company
philosophy / process issue and more importantly what our customers
think. There could even be contractual issues involved.

If one would look at our customer list, I think one could indirectly
determine that we would have to provide security fixes (
http://mvista.com/customers.php ).

How do I meet the requirement of "Proof"?
