The specifics for this list are not clear to me, but fixing a security
issue/bug can be done before the public release of the advisory. The
second the advisory hits "the news" you have the patches ready for you
customers. That's what I was trying to say. What Dan is pointing out as
well is important here, I'm sure that only advisories for your own
specific distri's and keeping those "in house" are providing your
customers with a false sense of security. A clever sysadmin will be aware
that a security fix for $distri will also mean that your software is
affected. And an evil hacker will know this as well.

But I'm taking my ass out of this discussion. I'm not providing a Linux
distribution, only part of the development team of an open source
e-commerce solution with the luck of only having one security bug / CVE in
the last 4 releases :P
