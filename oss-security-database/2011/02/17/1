Subject: CVE request -- kernel: deficiency in processing igmp host
 membership reports in br_multicast

"It was found that executing bridge snooping code triggered by host
originated IGMP packets could cause corruption in 512-byte slabs,
most commonly leading to crashes in jbd2. This could be possibly
exploited by local unprivileged user to crash the host (DoS)."
