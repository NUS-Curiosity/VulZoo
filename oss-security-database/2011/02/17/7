Subject: Re: CVE id request: telepathy-gabble

As best as I can tell, we should only need one ID:

CVE-2011-1000
â€¢ In jingle-factory.c, a malicious contact can trick Gabble into relaying media
through a server of their choosing. This allows any contact to intercept your
audio and video calls (as opposed to only attacker who can passively intercept
your network traffic, which is the normal state of affairs for unencrypted
calls).

If you think any of the others deserve an ID, let me know.

Thanks.
