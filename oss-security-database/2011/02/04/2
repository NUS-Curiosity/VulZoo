> 
> Legacy certificates generated by OpenSSH might contain data

> 
> 2. Affected configurations
> 
> OpenSSH 5.6 and OpenSSH 5.7 only when generating legacy
> certificates. These must be specifically requested using the
> "-t" option on the ssh-keygen CA command-line.
> 
> 3. Mitigation
> 
> Avoid generating legacy certificates using OpenSSH 5.6 or 5.7
> 
> If legacy certificates have been issued with a vulnerable
> OpenSSH version, consider rotating any CA key used.

> 4. Details
> 
> When generating legacy *-cert-v00@...nssh.com certificates,
> the nonce field was not being correctly filled with random
> data but was left uninitialised, containing the contents of
> the stack.
> 
> The contents of the stack at this point in ssh-keygen's
> execution do not appear to leak the CA private key or other
> sensitive data, but this possibility cannot be excluded on
> all platforms and library versions.

> If certificates are generated using user-specified contents
> (as opposed to the CA specifying all fields) then they will
> be less resistant to hash collision attacks. Fortunately,
> such attacks are not currently considered practical for the
> SHA family of hashes used to sign these certificates.
