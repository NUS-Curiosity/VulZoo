I'd say the later one. Filesystem drivers in the kernel should more or
less be treated like just another app that is able to read some kind of
"format". If the filesystem is corrupted, it should fail without
security impact.

As others already mentioned, the impact is not limited to automounting,
but also an issue for virtualzation (and maybe other cases we don't
think of yet).

Maybe it'd be a good idea to start a big fuzzing session on filesystems?
