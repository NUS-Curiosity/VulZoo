Subject: kernel: ALSA: caiaq - Fix possible string-buffer overflow

Reported by rafa@...infosecurity.com, "Use strlcpy() to assure not to 
overflow the string array sizes by too long USB device name string."

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=eaae55dac6b64c0616046436b294e69fc5311581

Just FYI, I'm not requesting a CVE name for this as it only affects 
Native Instruments USB audio devices with very long device name which I 
think is unlikely.

Thanks, Eugene
