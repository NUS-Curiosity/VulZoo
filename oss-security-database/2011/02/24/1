Subject: Pattern lock bypass on SE X10 with Android 1.6

Would something like http://www.nth-dimension.org.uk/blog.php?id=89 qualify 
for a CVE?  I didn't really consider it when I published it because I was 
working on the principal that it required physical access and you could 
therefore argue that all bets are off but I was was wondering in the light of 
the recent discussions about auto mounting bugs which share a similar quality.
