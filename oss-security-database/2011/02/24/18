Subject: CVE request: kernel: /proc/$pid/ leaks contents across setuid exec

Hi,

I'd like to get a CVE assigned for this information leak issue:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/2/7/368

Pre-opened file descriptors in /proc/$pid/ can bypass DAC allowing
visibility into setuid process state, especially leaking ASLR offset.

Thanks,

-Kees
