Subject: CVE request: Server-side arbitrary script inclusion vulnerability
 in MediaWiki <=1.16.1

Greetings,

MediaWiki 1.16.2 was just released as a security update for two
vulnerabilities. One already has a CVE, but this one still needs one:

"An arbitrary script inclusion vulnerability was discovered. The
vulnerability only allows execution of files with names ending in
".php" which are already present in the local filesystem. Only servers
running Microsoft Windows and possibly Novell Netware are affected.
Despite these mitigating factors, all users are advised to upgrade,
since there is a risk of complete server compromise. MediaWiki 1.8.0
and later is affected. For more details, see bug 27094"

Thanks,
