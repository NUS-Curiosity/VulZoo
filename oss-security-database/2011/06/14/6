Subject: CVE Request: prosody DoS, djabberd external entity injection

Hi,

As far as I know, there's no CVE for these ones yet. Could you assign one?
* prosody billion laughs DoS: http://blog.prosody.im/prosody-0-8-1-released/
* djabberd external entity injection:
http://groups.google.com/group/djabberd/browse_thread/thread/47974331c37e54c5#

Btw, a blog post about these and the other recent jabber billion
laughs vulnerabilities:

Regards,

Wouter.
