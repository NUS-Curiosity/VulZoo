As a practical matter, you could follow the Debian
secure-testing-commits mailing list [0] or check out the svn repo [1].
Updates to Mitre's CVE database are synced there twice a day.


Unfortunately, Mitre's databases pushes tend to have a couple day delay
built in.  I've been intending to convert to the NVD database, which
seems to get updated on exactly the disclosure date, but I haven't
gotten around to that yet.

Best wishes,
Mike
