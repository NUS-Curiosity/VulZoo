This is very nice, thanks.  Many of the commits have Debian-specific
info, though, which would be a bit distracting, and the Subjects are not
specific (just "data/CVE" or "data/DSA"), yet this may be helpful.

I downloaded
http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/secure-testing-commits/2011-May.txt.gz
and grepped it for SSL (case-insensitive).  Didn't find the OpenSSL
issue that started this thread.  This is not surprising: apparently, the
issue did not receive a CVE ID in May, even though CERT published a
Vulnerability Note on it.

Perhaps add these to
http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/distro-patches#debian ?
And, while you're at it, fix the many broken links currently in the
Debian section there (I counted at least three broken links).

Thanks,

Alexander
