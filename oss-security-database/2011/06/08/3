It may prevent it for one condition, but not others. For example if I su to
a normal user (not -c), I can keep the tty open. My point is it's not safe
to do this.

This is unsafe, I'm not even sure if it can be made safe honestly (without
breaking lots of things that expect tty access). Things like su and sudo
are designed to raise privileges, not lower them. If this isn't well
documented, it should be.

In your situation, I would suggest using something like ssh with key
authentication setup.
