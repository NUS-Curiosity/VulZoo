Subject: CVE Request -- Coppermine Photo Gallery -- cpg1.4.27 / cpg1.5.12
 -- XSS flaw

Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   Coppermine Photo Gallery upstream in the past addressed one XSS flaw 
in cpg1.4.27 / cpg1.5.12 versions. Further details:
[1] http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=347287
[2] 
http://forum.coppermine-gallery.net/index.php/topic,65023.msg322935.html#msg322935
[3] http://forum.coppermine-gallery.net/index.php/topic,69495.0.html
[4] http://sourceforge.net/news/?group_id=89658

There doesn't seem to be a CVE id for this issue yet (or at least I 
couldn't find one).

Note: Should be CVE-2010-XXYY CVE id.

Could you allocate one?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.
