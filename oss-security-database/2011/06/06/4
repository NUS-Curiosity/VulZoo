Subject: CVE Request -- LuaExpat -- Prone to XML "billion laughs attack"

Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   It was found that LuaExpat, a SAX XML parser based on the Expat
library, is prone to XML "billion laughs attack", as described in:
[1] 
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipcfsx/index.html#N100F1

A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which
once opened in an application, linked against LuaExpat, could cause
that application to crash.

[4] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=711027

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.
