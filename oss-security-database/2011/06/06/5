Subject: fetchmail 6.3.20 release to fix CVE-2011-1947 (was: CVE request for
 fetchmail STARTTLS hang (Denial of Service))

Greetings,

I've just released fetchmail 6.3.20 to fix the STARTTLS
denial-of-service problem present in all earlier fetchmail releases,
CVE-2011-1947.

Note that distributors are advised to thoroughly check the NEWS file and
consider doing a stable release update rather than just backporting the
security fixes, there were several notable bug fixes.

At least do note <http://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-EN-2010-03.txt> -
it's a good opportunity to fix this, too...

Changelog:
