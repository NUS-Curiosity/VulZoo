Yes, I will be considering this a kernel issue.
vsftpd also uses one (or more!) process per connection. I'd have though that
a process structure plus stack etc. would be a lot more heavyweight than an
empty network namespace, but obviously not :)

It's actually configurable in vsftpd.conf:
isolate_network=NO

So for a short term fix, all you need is to deploy that config change.
Looking at the Changelog, network isolation was added in vsftpd-2.2.0, and
the config setting has been there from v2.2.0 as well.
