I'm not worried too much about the interactive su case really. The 
usual direction there is user->root, not the other way around I 
suppose. "su -c" might be used by (%post) scripts though as seen 
with ikiwiki.
Wrt non-interactive sudo I'm not sure. It's less likely to be used 
by sane packages at least as it's behavior is rather unpredictable 
due to it's many configuration options.

Newer sudo actually have a use_pty option that fixes the problem. 
It's not enabled by default though.
As I just found out there's also code missing to make sudo actually 
honor the option in the config (patch attached, CC'd upstream).
Introducing similar code in su would be possible but requires some 
programming effort. sudo has a liberal licence though so the code 
could probably be reused.
