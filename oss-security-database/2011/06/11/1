Subject: CVE request: buffer overflow in tftp-hpa

The tftp-hpa daemon contained a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
function for setting the utimeout option. As the daemon accepts this
option from clients, the buffer overflow can be remotely exploited.

For a patch, see

> git clone http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/tftp/tftp-hpa.git/
> git diff 2864 f303

Thanks, Timo
