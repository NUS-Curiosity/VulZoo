Subject: CVE request: Multiple security vulnerabilities in ARSC Really
 Simple Chat

Could you assign CVE-identifiers for following security vulnerabilities?

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3310673&group_id=32699&atid=406296
http://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/xss_in_a_really_simple_chat_arsc.html

ARSC seems to be a bit of a sinking boat. I still wonder why htbridge does not request CVE-identifiers at all.

Best regards,
