Subject: CVE request -- coreutils -- tty hijacking possible in "su" via TIOCSTI
 ioctl


Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   based on Debian BTS report:
   [1] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=628843
       (first CVE-2011-XXYY required for Debian case)

looked more into original report:
[2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=173008

and the first paragraph of [2] suggests:
"When starting a program via "su - user -c program" the user session
can escape to the parent session by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push
characters into the input buffer.  This allows for example a non-root
session to push "chmod 666 /etc/shadow" or similarly bad commands into
the input buffer such  that after the end of the session they are
executed."

this should get a CVE-2005-YYZZ CVE id.

Could you allocate these?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.
