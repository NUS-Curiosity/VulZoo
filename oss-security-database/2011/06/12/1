Subject: CVE Request -- dbus -- Local DoS via messages with non-native byte
 order

Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   It was found that D-BUS message bus service / messaging facility did
not update the byte-order flag of the message properly by swapping the
byte order of incoming messages into their native endiannes. A local,
authenticated user could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted
message to a system service (like Avahi or NetworkManager), using the
system bus, potentially leading to disconnect of such a service from
system bus (denial of service).

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
