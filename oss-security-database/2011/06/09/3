Subject: CVE Request -- vte -- Excessive memory and CPU use by processing
 certain character sequences

Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   An memory exhaustion flaw was found in the way VTE, a terminal
emulator widget, processed certain character sequences. A remote
attacker could provide a specially-crafted file, which once opened
in a terminal using the VTE terminal emulator could lead to excessive
memory and CPU consumption (leading to subsequent particular process
termination by OOM killer on some systems).

Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.
