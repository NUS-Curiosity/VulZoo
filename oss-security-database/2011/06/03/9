In short: This is a feature, not a bug.

Origin of current behavior:
---------------------------
The 'blob_plain' action (raw view) together with support for path_info
URLs were designed together so that gitweb could be used as a kind of
deploy platform.  For example you can browse git documentation from
'html' branch of git.git repository using gitweb, c.f.

  http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git/blob_plain/html:/git.html

Also, by default (and I think in most configurations) there isn't
anything worth stealing using cross-side scripting attack; there
is no login information, no cookies with sensitive information...

Proposal of solution:
---------------------
Nevertheless gitweb include a germ of anti-XSS framework, namely
$prevent_xss gitweb configuration variable.

It is currently used to prevent displaying README.html from $GIT_DIR
of repository, but I think it can be reused for this situation (at
the cost of reduced feature set).  Namely if $prevent_xss is true,
we can simply serve all 'blob_plain' as either text/plain or 
application/octet-stream (with possible exception of *.jpg, *.gif
and *.png images).

Proposed patch:
---------------
Note that it includes unrelated fix for $prevent_xss feature.  It would
be split in separate patch (non-security related bugfix).

With this patch above lol.xml would be served as text/plain...
