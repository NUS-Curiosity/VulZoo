Subject: CVE Request -- fabric -- Use of insecure temporary file by uploading
 templates and projects to remote hosts


Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   It was found that fabric, a simple Pythonic remote deployment tool,
used insecure way for creation of temporary files, when uploading
template text files and project files to a remote system. A local
attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks to upload
sensitive information to remote host or to overwrite certain local
system files.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.
