PostgreSQL is affected as well (the pgcrypto module):

% head crypt-blowfish.c 
/*
  * $PostgreSQL: pgsql/contrib/pgcrypto/crypt-blowfish.c,v 1.14 2009/06/11 14:48:52 momjian Exp $
  *
  * This code comes from John the Ripper password cracker, with reentrant
  * and crypt(3) interfaces added, but optimizations specific to password
  * cracking removed.

php-suhosin also contains the same code.
