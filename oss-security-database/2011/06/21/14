Are you considering this a flaw, or just an interesting security exercise?
Nothing currently comes to mind, but it's possible there could be other
data where knowing it exists and the size would be useful. I'm thinking
this isn't terribly dangerous for something like ssh.

This is very interesting either way. Well done.
