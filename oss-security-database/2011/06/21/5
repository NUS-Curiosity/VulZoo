I'm not sure if this should get two IDs. It's really one issue, which isn't
actually fixed in su.

The fundamental issue is that tools like su and sudo keep the tty open.
The patch in question closes the tty for the case of su -c, but not for
just running su by itself. It is incomplete.

It should get a 2005 ID at the very least, MITRE will have to do that.
Perhaps two 2005 IDs? One for the issue, the second for the incomplete fix
(which is still not fixed)?

I think the bigger issue is it needs to be decided what is proper behavior
and document that. I'm not smart enough to know if this can be fixed
properly without crippling these tools.

Thanks.
