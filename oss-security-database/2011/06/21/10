Ok, so taking a quick look at php-suhosin, we have:

...
  61 typedef unsigned int BF_word;
...
558     BF_word tmp;
559 
560     for (i = 0; i < BF_N + 2; i++) {
561         tmp = 0;
562         for (j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
563             tmp <<= 8;
564             tmp |= *ptr;

I'm assuming the above means it is vulnerable (unsigned int vs unsigned
char).
