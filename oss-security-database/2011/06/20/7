Would it make sense to include transitional compatability calls
which preserve the original behavior? Then applications using the
library can be adjusted to fall back on the buggy version if the
supplied data has 8-bit characters and the corrected calls don't
result in a match. This would allow tools to regenerate and replace
non-conforming hashes if they were the result of this bug, and might
make it easier to audit existing lists for them as well.
