No, I agree your proposed approach lends a more general solution
which could be applied to the use cases I was considering. I saw you
mention it over on the crypto list as well, but it sounded like you
were trying to find ways to avoid a new hash encoding identifier in
the wild which could conflict with something OpenBSD might consider
assigning for some other purpose at a later date (though assuming
this workaround makes it onto their radar, that seems an unlikely
situation anyway).
