I still receive bug reports for shadow-utils for the non-PAM variant.
(bug I don't remember if these bugs were reported for su).
In my case, I would prefer to keep the su non-PAM variant as long as I
would support non-PAM variants for the other tools (or as long as I
support su).

Regarding distros without PAM, there might be gentoo to be counted in the
list (although PAM is enabled by default).

Kind Regards,
