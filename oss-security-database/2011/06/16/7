Maybe I'm mis-reading the above statement, but it seems to imply it's
not uncommon for you to re-do security patches that were applied to
RHEL packages before building them as OEL updates.  Do you have any
specific examples to point to (on- or off-list), so we can possibly
check what mistakes we did?

Thank you!
