Greg has posted the patch to LKML (http://lkml.org/lkml/2011/6/1/119).

The patch:

commit cae13fe4cc3f24820ffb990c09110626837e85d4 upstream.

As Ben Hutchings discovered [1], the patch for CVE-2011-1017 (buffer
overflow in ldm_frag_add) is not sufficient.  The original patch in
commit c340b1d64000 ("fs/partitions/ldm.c: fix oops caused by corrupted
partition table") does not consider that, for subsequent fragments,
previously allocated memory is used.
