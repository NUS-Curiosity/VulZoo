Subject: CVE-request: XSS in Webmin 1.540

Hi,

I would like to receive CVE-identifier for this issue in Webmin. References:

http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Apr/393

Javier Bassi told me that the Bugtraq ID is 47558. Couldn't find this from OSVDB. Fixed in commit: https://github.com/webmin/webmin/commit/46e3d3ad195dcdc1af1795c96b6e0dc778fb6881 which is included to Webmin 1.550 release.

Should be 2011 identifier.

Best regards,
Henri Salo
