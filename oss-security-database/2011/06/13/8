A CVE id was assigned here:
http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q2/478

As for getting an ID in the future, your best bet is to mail me directly
with your request. MITRE is generally swamped with requests, where I don't
service near the volume they do.

If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

Thanks.
