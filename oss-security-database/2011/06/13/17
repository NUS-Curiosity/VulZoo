Subject: Re: CVE Request -- libvoikko -- DoS of application
 linked against libvoikko due improper handling of embedded null characters
 in input strings

Steve,

Can MITRE comment on this one? I'm not really sure what to do.

The core issue, embedded null characters seems to be the same for both Java and Python, but the fix covers two different bits of code.

My guess is it's just one ID, but I'd like to be certain.

Thanks.
