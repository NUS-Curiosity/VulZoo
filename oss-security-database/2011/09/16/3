Subject: closed-list membership transition

Hello,

My last day with Canonical is today. Starting on Sep 19th, I will be
working for Google on ChromeOS. I'd like to transition my closed-list
membership based on the fact that ChromeOS is also a distro, and I'll
still have security responsibilities with it. How should this be handled?

Thanks,

-Kees
