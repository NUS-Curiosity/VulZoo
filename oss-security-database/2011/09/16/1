Subject: Is there a maintainer for librsvg ?

Hello,

librsvg is a SVG rendering library hosted at librsvg.sourceforge.net. No
new version was published since 2005, and a (security) bug that I
reported via bugzilla.gnome.org 6 weeks ago wasn't even triaged.

Given that this lib is used by a lot of distros, what can I do in order
to get this bug (and others) patched ?

Regards,
Nicolas
