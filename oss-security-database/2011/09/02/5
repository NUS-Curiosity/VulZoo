Isn't this just CVE-2011-1198 then (which is suspiciously missing from
that set of security announcements)?   CVE-2011-1198 was assigned on
March 30th, which certainly could have been referenced in the Mandriva
advisories, they just missed it I guess?  Given this kind of
carelessness, I think we should err on the side of not issuing new
ids based on ill-defined text like this future Mandriva advisories.

This may just be a wording choice.  We have more discussion going on
right now [0], so hopefully we'll get it resolved there.
