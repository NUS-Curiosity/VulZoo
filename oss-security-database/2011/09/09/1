Subject: CVE Request -- evolution -- Uses insecure (non-SSL) connection when
 storing the sent message into the Sent folder

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it was found that Evolution, mail and calendar client, used insecure
(non-SSL) connection when attempting to store sent email message into
the Sent folder, when the Sent folder was located on the remote server.
An attacker on the adjacent network, able to intercept the underlying
communication could use this flaw to obtain login credentials of the
victim.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
