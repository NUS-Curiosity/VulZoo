Subject: CVE Request -- Zope/Plone -- Unspecified vulnerability in Zope v2.12.x

   Plone upstream has published a pre-announcement about a security
flaw, present in Zope v2.12.x and Zope v2.13.x, which could allow
execution of arbitrary code by anonymous users. An authenticated
attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page, which once
visited by an unsuspecting Zope user would lead to arbitrary commands
execution with the privileges of the Zope/Plone service.
