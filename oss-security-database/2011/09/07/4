Subject: CVE Request -- openvas-scanner -- Insecure temporary file use by
 generation of an OVAL system characteristics document, when ovaldi support
 enabled

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it was reported that the scanner module for the Open Vulnerability
Assessment System (OpenVAS) used insecure way for creation of a
temporary file, when generating OVAL system characteristics document
from the knowledge base data available, with the ovaldi integrated tool
enabled. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink
attacks to overwrite arbitrary files on the system, accessible with the
privileges of the user running the SLAD daemon and / or the ovaldi OVAL
interpreter.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
