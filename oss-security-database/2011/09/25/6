That's a valid concern however it is another matter.

My suggestion would be:

- get a CVE and assign it to the bug

- be sure to get the right information in the CVE
  .  about why it is not a flaw in php itself per se but a behavior
change that could introduce a flaw in existing php scripts
     . these php scripts were not following our guidance or good practice guide

- Be sure we update the upgrade guide, the NEWS file, the
documentation and the announce to clearly explain and define this
problem and its consequences

Cheers,
