I'm concerned that if we do it this way people would take it as "PHP has 
security bug in is_a and it was fixed in this version, so as long as we 
run updated version we're OK", not "my code has gaping security hole 
which by pure luck wasn't exploitable but minor change made it 
exploitable". If we don't make it crystal clear the latter and not the 
former is the case, we'd have same problem with 5.4.
