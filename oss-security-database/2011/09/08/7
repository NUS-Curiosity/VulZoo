Subject: CVE request: Quassel < 0.7.3 CTCP request core DoS

Hi,

please assign a CVE for the following issue:
CtcpParser::packedReply in src/core/ctcpparser.cpp in Quassel does not process
certain CTCP requests correctly, allowing a remote attacker connected to the
same IRC network as the victim to cause a Denial of Service condition by
sending specially crafted CTCP requests. This was demonstrated in various
exploits on freenode today.

Gentoo tracks the issue in [1], upstream fix is [2].

Thanks,
Alex
