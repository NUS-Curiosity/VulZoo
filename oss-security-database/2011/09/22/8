Subject: CVE Request: X.org ProcRenderGlyps input sanitation issue

Hi,

Also from 2010 and me@...fdog.net and the x.org bugtracker:

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28801

Adam in comment #c2 thinks this might just discloses memory
but could not overwrite arbitrary x server memory ... 
However the comment #c0 has a x.org server crash, so I am unsure
about code execution possibilities.

Needs one 2010 CVE id I guess.

Ciao, Marcus
