Subject: CVE request: fluxbb before 1.4.7

http://fluxbb.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=5751

"This is a security release, however only affects anyone running FluxBB
behind a reverse proxy, with FORUM_BEHIND_REVERSE_PROXY enabled - we
expect this to be a small number of users."

Whatever that means... I suggest something like
"Unknown security vulnerability related to reverse proxying"
