Subject: CVE Request -- phpPgAdmin -- Multiple XSS flaws fixed in v5.0.3

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were reported in phpPgAdmin:

1) the 'title' argument of a particular web page was not sanitized
    properly prior displaying the page header,

2) the return ULR ('return_url') and return link name ('return_desc')
    were not sanitized properly prior displaying the requested page data.

A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL, which once
visited by an unsuspecting phpPgAdmin user could lead to arbitrary HTML
or web script execution.
