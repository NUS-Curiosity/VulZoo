It's likely the Mozilla security team hasn't assigned a CVE. The issue
only affects applications initializing NSS with NSS_NoDB_Init(). Usually
the application specifies the actual path to these files. In particular
Mozilla apps always specify (though some corner cases it may fall back
to NSS_NoDB_Init(). I think that's rare at this point because
NSS_NoDB_Init() does not provide any trust information, which all
Mozilla apps need.).

In general NSS applications on Linux should be initializing with
/etc/pki/nssdb.

NOTE: the patch is in FIPS related code.  Elio, please get a 6.2 Bug
created for this ASAP. The patch is already upstream. Component is
nss-softokn.
