Subject: MySQL executable comment execution on MySQL slave server (from 2009)

This is an old one that slipped through in 2009:

The executable comment capability in MySQL before 5.1.50 and 5.0.93
can be used to execute arbitrary SQL commands as a privileged user.
This occurs on MySQL servers configured as slaves in a MySQL
replication environment where the slave server is running a newer
version of MySQL than the server. The attacker would need the ability
to add custom comments to a database on the MySQL server.
