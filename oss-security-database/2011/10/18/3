Subject: CVE Request: pam

Hello,

Could a CVE please be assigned to the following issue:

A Debian/Ubuntu specific patch in pam, update-motd, calls the scripts
in /etc/update-motd.d as root without sanitizing the environment.

See:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pam/+bug/610125

Thanks,

Marc.
