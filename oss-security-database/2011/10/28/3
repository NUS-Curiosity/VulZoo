Now there is information in the URI.

Facts:

- Affect all Piwik users that have let granted some access to the "anonymous" user
- Remotely exploitable vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
- Versions affected Piwik 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4
- Credits: Neal Poole

These details should be enough information for CVE assignment. I can also verify this issue if you want for every version? If there isn't enough details I can dig more :)
