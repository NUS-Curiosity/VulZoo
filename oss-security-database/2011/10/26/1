Subject: CVE Request -- kernel: xfs: potential buffer overflow in
 xfs_readlink()

A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's XFS filesystem implementation
handled links with pathname larger than MAXPATHLEN. When
CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG configuration option was not enabled when compiling
Linux kernel, an attacker able to mount malicious XFS image could use
this flaw to crash the system, or potentially, elevate his privileges
on that system.

Proposed upstream patch:
