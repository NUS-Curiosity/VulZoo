Subject: CVE Request -- kernel: sysctl: restrict write access to
 dmesg_restrict

When dmesg_restrict is set to 1 CAP_SYS_ADMIN is needed to read the
kernel ring buffer. But a root user without CAP_SYS_ADMIN is able
to reset dmesg_restrict to 0.

This is an issue when e.g.  LXC (Linux Containers) are used and complete
user space is running without CAP_SYS_ADMIN.  A unprivileged and jailed
root user can bypass the dmesg_restrict protection.
