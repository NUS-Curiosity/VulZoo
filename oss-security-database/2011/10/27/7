Just because a patch doesn't fix an immediate problem right now
doesn't mean it isn't the right thing to do.  For consistency's sake,
it makes sense that it should require CAP_SYS_ADMIN to modify this
sysctl, and it's certainty not a bad idea to move towards a more
well-defined security boundary for LXC for the future.  That's why I
ack'ed the patch.  I simply meant that assigning a CVE for this case
was silly because it doesn't represent a violation of a real security
boundary.
