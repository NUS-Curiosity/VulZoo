Subject: CVE Request: mplayer RDT parsing integer underlow

Hi,

Please assign a CVE for this issue from 2009. From [1]:

"Function real_get_rdt_chunk() calls rtsp_read_data() to read RDT
(Real Data Transport) chunks headers from the network and after that it
will parse them. A controled variable is used to allocate a buffer and
later passed on to the rtsp_read_data() function in order to specify the
length of an RDT chunk data to read from the network. An integer
underflow can be triggered when parsing a malformed RDT header chunk,
a remote attacker can exploit it to execute arbitrary code in the
context of the application."
