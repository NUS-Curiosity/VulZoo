Subject: Re: CVE request: piwik before 1.6

AFAIK there's been no official change in disclosure policy by the Piwik project.  Advisories are separate from the release notes/changelog and are typically published within a week of release.

That said, I expect this will take longer than usual given the number of vulnerabilities addressed in this release.
