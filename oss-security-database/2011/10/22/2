Actually, I think my proposed reproducer (many nested 250-char dirs)
triggers this one and not the strcat().  On one build, hardlink then
crashes after dereferencing the "dirs" pointer, which happens to be
overwritten with a directory name.  On another build (different gcc
version and arch), hardlink does not crash (although I think it would on
even more nested directories), but reports a ridiculous directory count
(so "ndirs" is overwritten).  -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 didn't make a
difference here (different program binary, same observed behavior).
