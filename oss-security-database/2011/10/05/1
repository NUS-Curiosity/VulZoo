Subject: kexec-tools: Multiple security flaws by management of kdump core
 files and ramdisk images

Hi All,

Kevan Carstensen reported multiple security flaws in kexec-tools, 
details are as follows:

1. CVE-2011-3588:

The default value of "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" has been used for kdump/ 
mkdumprd openssh integration. A remote malicious kdump server could use 
this flaw to impersonate the intended, correct kdump server to obtain 
security sensitive information (kdump core files).

2. CVE-2011-3589

mkdumprd utility copied content of certain directories into newly 
created initial ramdisk images, potentially leading to information leak.

3. CVE-2011-2390

mkdumprd utility created the final initial ramdisk image with 
world-readable permissions, possibly leading to information leak.
