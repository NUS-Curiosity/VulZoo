Looks like they do.  FWIW, the counter overflow could be fixed by simply
using uint_64, which would overflow in 20 billion years :)

Some distros probably don't want to switch to the development version of
Gobby (which also uses a different dependency), but to fix the bugs of
their own stable versions.

As personally I am not a maintainer of a distro with the official Gobby
support, I don't care about maintaining old versions much, though.  I'm
happy with the fixes in the dev version.

OK, I'll probably look at libinfinity at my spare time as I did it with obby.
