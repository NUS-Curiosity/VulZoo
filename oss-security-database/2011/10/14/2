I dont think so. From the code i have read so far, here is what seems to 
happen.

- radvd starts as root
- reads the configs
- if a username is specified (user=radvd in most cases):
	- if "--singleprocess" is not specified:
		- run privsep_init(): This forks another process which
		  runs as root. So after this point we have two
		  processes both running as root
		- If privsep_init() fails, we have just one process
		  running as root
	- run drop_root_privileges():
		If this succedes, we have two processes one running as
		root and another as radvd user, or if privsep_init()
		failed earlier, we have one process running as radvd
		user.
		If this fails, application quits
- If username was not specified radvd continues to run as a single 
process as root.


So failure in privsep_init() results in just one process running as 
radvd user. If it did not fail it would result in one process running as 
root and another as radvd user.

I dont think this would be a security issue in my opinion.
