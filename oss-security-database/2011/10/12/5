Subject: Ruby 1.9.2-p290 WEBrick::HTTPRequest X-Forwarded-*

Got my Ruby/Ruby on rails mixed up.

Various methods in WEBrick::HTTPRequest in Ruby 1.9.2-p290 and
1.8.7-p352 and earlier and do not validate the X-Forwarded-For,
X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Server headers in requests, which might
allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary text into log files or bypass
intended address parsing via a crafted header.

Can we get a CVE for this please?
