In case someone didn't fully track the discussion thread, I'll sum it up -

In the original patch the variable name is typoed/confused - the check
should be against "iface" instead of "name".  The check against "name"
is totally wrong as it checks a static hint string, which always passes
the check.

The confused blacklisted iface set is a bug, but not a security bug;
the confused variable name is indeed a security bug (not a flaw per se,
but it greatly weakens the privsep model).


Thanks to Solar Designer for pointing out that this thing is probably
not clear to everybody.
