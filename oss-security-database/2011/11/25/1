Subject: CVE Request: colord sql injections

Hi,

colord did not quote user supplied strings which made it prone to
SQL injections:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42904
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=698250

When colord runs as root and local active users are allowed to
create new devices (both are the defaults AFAIK) this allows not
only to corrupt colord's own database but also to leverage it to
modify other databases in the system (PackageKit for example also
uses sqlite).

PoC available on request.
