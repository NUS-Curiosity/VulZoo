Subject: CVE Request -- Ruby on Rails / rubygem-actionpack -- XSS in the 'translate'
 helper method

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the
'translate' helper method of the Ruby on Rails performed HTML
escaping of interpolated user input, when interpolation in
combination with HTML-safe translations were used. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary HTML or web
script by providing a specially-crafted input to Ruby on Rails
application, using the ActionPack module and its 'translate'
helper method without explicit (application specific) sanitization
of user provided input.
