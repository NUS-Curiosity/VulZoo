Subject: CVE Request -- libsocialweb -- Untrusted connection opened to Twitter
 social service without user's approval upon service start via dbus

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way the libsocialweb,
a social network data aggregator, performed its initialization
when this service start was initiated by the dbus daemon.
Due to a deficiency in a way the libsocialweb service was
initialized, an untrusted (non-SSL) network connection has
been opened to remote Twitter service servers without explicit
approval of the user, running the libsocialweb service on the
local host. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct
various MITM attacks and potentially alter integrity of the user
account in question.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

P.S.: This one being on the border a bit (since clear security
       consequences of this deficiency not completely investigated),
       but in any case it's a bad programming practice to open
       untrusted connection to remote servers by default without
       particular users' approval (trust boundary crossing).
