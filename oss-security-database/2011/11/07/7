Subject: CVE Request -- Ruby (OpenSSL extension) -- Insecure way of creation
 exponent value by private RSA key generation

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way the OpenSSL extension of the
Ruby programming language (of version from the Git trunk repository
after 2011-09-01 up to 2011-11-03) generated exponent value to be used
for private RSA key generation (the bug caused the exponent for the
generated key to be always '1'). A remote attacker could use this flaw
to bypass / corrupt integrity of services, depending on strong private
RSA keys generation mechanism.

Relevant upstream patch:
[1] http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=33633

References:
[2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=751800

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
