Subject: CVE Request -- pam_yubico -- Authentication bypass via NULL password

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way pam_yubico, a pluggable
authentication module for yubikeys, performed user authentication,
when 'use_first_pass' PAM configuration option was not used and
pam_yubico module was configured as 'sufficient' in the PAM 
configuration. A remote attacker could use this flaw to circumvent
common authentication process and obtain access to the account in
question by providing a NULL value (pressing Ctrl-D keyboard
sequence) as the password string.

Relevant upstream patch:
[1] 
https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-pam/commit/4712da70cac159d5ca9579c1e4fac0645b674043

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
