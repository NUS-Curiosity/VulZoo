Here's another related option:

	if (strlen(key) > 100000 || strlen(salt) > 100000)
		abort();

(or something like this).  Ridiculous?  Sure, but it's better than
overwriting another thread's stack or the heap with somewhat higher
lengths, and 100001 chars is not a more reasonable password length to
support than, say, 2 million or 10 million (typical thread stack sizes).

So if we can't decide on a proper fix (does anyone besides me even
care?), something as trivial as the above would be an improvement.
