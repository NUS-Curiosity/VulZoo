Subject: CVE Request -- ReviewBoard v1.5.7 && v1.6.3 -- XSS in the commenting
 system (diff viewer and screenshot pages components)

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way the commenting
system of the ReviewBoard, a web-based code review tool, sanitized user
input (new comments to be loaded). A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted URL, which once visited by valid ReviewBoard user
could lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution in the 'diff
viewer' or 'screenshot pages' components.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

P.S.: Cc-ed Christian Hammond, who committed change [4] to the
       upstream Git repository too, so they could update CVE id
       in their advisory, if / where needed.
