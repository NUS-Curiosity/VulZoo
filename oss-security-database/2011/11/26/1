Please send me (off-list is OK) your PGP key and e-mail address to
subscribe to the new list.

I thought there would be more interest in this, but I don't mind setting
this up as just pkgsrc + Linux distros initially.

(And, like I said, the Linux distros list will also continue to exist on
its own, letting message senders decide on who to notify.)

Thanks,

Alexander
