Subject: CVE Request: openssh 5.8p2

Hi,

http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-5.8p2
http://www.openssh.com/txt/portable-keysign-rand-helper.adv
http://www.nessus.org/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=53841

has a security issue listed without a assigned CVE.

Could someone please assign a CVE id?

(We are not affected, but as we got customer queries regarding the
Nessus check already it should get a CVE id I think.)

Ciao, Marcus
