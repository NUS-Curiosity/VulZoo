Subject: libcap/capsh: does not chdir after chroot

Hi All,

It was found that capsh program, usually shipped with the libcap
package, did not do a chdir("/") after calling chroot, when called with
a "--chroot" option. This resulted in the current directory being
outside the chroot.

This has been assigned CVE-2011-4099
