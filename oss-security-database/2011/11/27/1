Subject: CVE Request -- ClearSilver (neo_cgi) -- Format string flaw by processing
 CGI error messages in Python module

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a format string flaw was found in the Python CGI Kit (neo_cgi)
module of ClearSilver, a language-neutral HTML templating system,
processed certain input, leading to Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
script errors. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
input, which once processed by an application, using the Python
language API of ClearSilver neo_cgi module, could lead to that
particular application crash, or, potentially arbitrary code
execution with the privileges of the user running the application.
