All,

I haven't followed the Calibre saga too closely, barring glancing through 
the bug report comments.

If bugs are introduced into a development version but also fixed within 
that same version, then unless there's some strong evidence that the dev 
version is extensively used or distributed to the public, then (in 
general) it would not get a CVE.  (The Linux kernel is a special case 
depending on what versions you consider to be "development.")
