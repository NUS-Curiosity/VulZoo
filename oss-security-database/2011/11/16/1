Subject: CVE Request: openid4java not properly verifying the signature of Attribute Exchange (AX) information

It was found that openid4java was not checking that all Attribute Exchange (AX) information passed to it was signed. This is a security concern if AX is being used to receive information that an application only trusts the identity provider to assert.

Upstream advisory: http://openid.net/2011/05/05/attribute-exchange-security-alert/
Patch commit: http://code.google.com/p/openid4java/source/detail?r=661
Secunia advisory: http://secunia.com/advisories/44496/
