Sorry for my bad English, I am Brazilian. kkkkkkkkk
I am quoting a bug in the script "SeTpartitions," the official Slackware
installer. I suggested a correction in lines 374, 495, 496, 503, where
instead of using / mnt, which is used for the variable mountpoint '$ T_PX'.

I found this bug since 2002 used the installer for my Slackware Linux
distribution based on Gentoo. After modifying the installer could normally
use.
PS: I use a different mount point / mnt as used by Pat use another LiveCD, also
created by me.

Thank you for listening. I tried to send this email to Patrick, but
went 30 days
without response, so headed here for the list.

Any other questions just give me a report.

Sds,
