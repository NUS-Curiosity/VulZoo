Subject: CVE Request -- kernel: nfs4_getfacl decoding kernel oops

"nfs4_getfacl decoding causes a kernel Oops when a server returns more
than 2 GETATTR bitmap words in response to the FATTR4_ACL attribute
request.

While the NFS client only asks for one attribute (FATTR4_ACL) in the
first bitmap word, the NFSv4 protocol allows for the server to return
unbounded bitmaps (more than two)."

Upstream commit:
e5012d1f3861d18c7f3814e757c1c3ab3741dbcd - incomplete, handles only the
case when 2 words are expected and 3 are returned

Proposed complete upstream patch:
