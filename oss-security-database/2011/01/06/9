Right, but CAP_SYS_ADMIN != root, or at least it isn't meant to be. I
mean if CAP_SYS_ADMIN == root, then one or the other doesn't need to
exist. There is an exposure here, and for that it deserves a CVE
identifier (of course in my opinion).  See Brad Spengler's recent
write-up [0]. There should be some effort toward making those 21 root
equivalent capabilities discussed there non-equivalent.

Best wishes,
Mike
