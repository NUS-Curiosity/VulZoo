This is a slippery slope.  I'm in favor of not having a CVE assigned
for this issue.

Otherwise, wouldn't we need a CVE for every vector that allows
transitioning from various capabilities to root?  The capability
system may be poorly designed to allow such transitions, but I don't
think they represent unexpected behavior.
