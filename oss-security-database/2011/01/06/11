What's the point of a capabilities system if its equivalent to root
in the majority of cases anyway?  For file access/operations, there is
always sudo and the /etc/sudoers file for making it easy to access to
stuff thats accessed often without a password.  For port binding, the
capabilities system makes sense; and according to Brad Spengler's list,
those caps don't appear to be root equivalent so that could stay.
Otherwise, I don't see the point.

I'm not sure if there is a written security model for the capabilities
system, but this looks to me like it would be a violation of it.

Best wishes,
