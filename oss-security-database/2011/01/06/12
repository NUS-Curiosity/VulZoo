Subject: Re: CVE-NONE kernel: PHONET signedness issue

IMO, there is a (usually fairly clear) distinction between ways that a
capability can transition to root "by design" and ones that are implementation
bugs.

If I, as a system administrator, grant you CAP_SYS_ADMIN, assuming that I know
what I'm doing, I intend you to have the ability to (for example) mount and
unmount filesystems. It is conceivable, although barely, that I have put in
other protections in place to prevent you from using that ability from
escalating yourself to full root.

I almost certainly did /not/ intend to grant you the ability to corrupt kernel
memory using a signedness error in the phonet subsystem. And so, in my opinion,
this does represent a deviation from the intended security model that could
"allow an attacker to [...] violate a reasonable security policy for that
system", even if it's extremely unlikely that anyone is actually operating under
such a security model.

Admittedly, in the case of CAP_SYS_ADMIN, this is a hopelessly fine distinction
because of the number of ways that CAP_SYS_ADMIN is equivalent to "full control
of the machine".

I don't personally care whether this issue gets a CVE, but I do think there is a
distinction to be made here that is worth being aware of.
