Subject: CVE request: multiple status.net issues

Hello,

I wanted to get some CVEs assigned for some minor issues that I reported to
status.net.

    syslog message spoofing via newline injections into logging
    http://status.net/open-source/issues/2795

    limited XSS in error message contents
    http://status.net/open-source/issues/2796 (fixed)

    unsafe use of addslashes for SQL string escapes
    http://status.net/open-source/issues/2797 (fixed)

Thanks,

-Kees
