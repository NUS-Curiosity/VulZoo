   Cc-ed Hyrum to shed more light into this one. [1] mentions two issues:

...
several bug fixes, including two which can cause client-initiated
crashes on the server.
</end quote>

Further look at:
[2] http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/tags/1.6.15/CHANGES

suggest:

A, "* prevent crash in mod_dav_svn when using SVNParentPath (r1033166)" being the first one.
    Upstream changeset:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1033166

and after discussion with Joe Orton, Joe suggested:

B, * fix server-side memory leaks triggered by 'blame -g' (r1032808)
    References:
    http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2010-11/0102.shtml
    Upstream changeset:
    http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1032808

    being the second one as denial of service attack (by memory consumption) against
    svnserve.

Questions:
----------
Hyrum, could you confirm A, and B, issues are those two, mentioned in [2]
to be able to cause client-initiated crashes on the server?

Josh, since CVE-2010-4539 was assigned. Once Hyrum confirms, can
we consider CVE-2010-4539 to be a CVE identifier for A, issue
and request yet another / second one for B, issue?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
