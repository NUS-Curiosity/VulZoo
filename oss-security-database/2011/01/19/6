Subject: CVE request: heap corruption in VLC media player

>From upstream git [1]:

"This patch resolves two heap corruption vulnerabilities in the CDG
decoder for VLC media player.  In both cases, a failure to properly
validate indexes into statically-sized arrays on the heap allows a
maliciously crafted CDG video to corrupt the heap in a controlled
manner, potentially leading to code execution."
