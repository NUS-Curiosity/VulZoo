Subject: CGI.pm 3.51 released


As discussed, CGI.pm 3.51 was released today, including the related
security fix. It is available here:

http://cpan.cpantesters.org/authors/id/M/MA/MARKSTOS/CGI.pm-3.51.tar.gz

CGI.pm has had a backlog of bug fixes that were pending release, so it
includes a number of other improvements as well.

Thanks to the related security teams and other contributors for the help.
