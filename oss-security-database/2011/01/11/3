Subject: CVE request: sudo does not ask for password on GID changes

A Debian bug report noted that sudo does not access for a password on
GID changes, like it does for UID changes.  This could allow a user to
execute commands using '-g [group]' without being prompted for their
password.

It uses a (newer?) syntax; on 1.6.7p5 at least the '(ALL:ALL)'
specification gives a syntax error; I'm not sure when this behaviour was
introduced.

Could a CVE name be assigned to this please?

Thanks.
