Unless/until there's some formal/semi-formal statement that "CAP_SYS_ADMIN 
is equivalent to root in all cases," then these kinds of 
privileged-to-privileged issues are within the scope of CVE since they 
violate the security model; now, they might receive very low risk scores 
because the attacker is already privileged, and I could see how vendors 
might reasonably avoid publishing advisories for them, but that doesn't 
mean there shouldn't be a CVE assigned to it.  Personally I agree with 
Michael that if two cap's/privileges have both "A implies B" and "B 
implies A," then one of them doesn't need to exist, but that's irrelevant.

It would be interesting (though I suspect controversial) for someone in 
the Linux kernel world to take a stab at more closely defining/defining a 
"security policy" regarding capability-to-capability transitions.  (Or 
could someone point me to one?)  As a Linux outsider, I like seeing these 
kinds of discussions.
