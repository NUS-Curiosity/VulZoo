Subject: [HITB-Announce] Reminder: HITB2011AMS - Call for Papers closes on the 18th of Feb

Happy 2011 everyone! Just a reminder that the Call for Papers for the
second annual HITBSecConf in Europe is closing on the 18TH OF FEBRUARY!
We've received some awesome submissions so far and the event is really
shaping up nicely.

The event will once again take place at the NH Grand Krasnapolsky in
Amsterdam from the 17th - 20th of May. HITB2011AMS will be a quad-track
conference line up featuring keynote speaker Joe Sullivan (Chief
Security Officer of Facebook) and a special keynote panel discussion on
'The Economics of Vulnerabilities'

In addition, the event also features a brand new Capture The Flag -
World Domination competition run by the HITB.nl CTF Crew, an expanded
Hackerspaces Village (now featuring a Hackerspaces Challenge with LEGO
MINDSTORMS!) an updated Lock Picking Village run by members from
TOOOL.nl and of course the HITBSIGINT sessions - 15 minute talks held
during the coffee and lunch breaks with a focus on highlighting up and
coming research and researchers.

As always, talks that are more technical or that discuss new and never
before seen attack methods are of more interest than a subject that has
been covered several times before.

# Cloud Security
# 3G/4G/WIMAX Security
