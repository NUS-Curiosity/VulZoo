Looking at the following wireshark bug and the relevant commits:

https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5530

http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=35292
http://anonsvn.wireshark.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=35298

It seems that there are two issues here, buffer overflow in MAC-LTE
dissector as well as buffer overflow in SNMP engineID preferences.

This issue was however assigned only one CVE i.e. CVE-2011-0444.
Do you think two CVEs (for each individual issues), should be assigned
in this case?
