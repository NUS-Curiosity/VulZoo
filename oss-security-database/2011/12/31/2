Merging these two issues as per ADT4:

At this stage, X and Y are the same bug type, affect the same versions,
and affect the same products.

Do X and Y have any of the following characteristics?

  * X appears in a different DLL, library, or program than Y (e.g. X
    affects LIB1.DLL and Y affects LIB2.DLL)
  * X has more serious impact than Y (e.g. code execution as root versus
    leak of system pathname)
  * X takes a different input parameter/argument than Y (e.g. SQL
    injection in both the "user" and "password" parameters)
  * X is exploitable locally, but Y is not.
  * X requires stronger authentication than Y.
  * X can be exploited by a certain user that Y can not (e.g. a guest
    user vs. an admin)

*Yes:* *MERGE

*Please use CVE-2011-4918 for these two issues

Does anyone have a contact name for Secunia with respect to
co-ordinating CVE assignments better?
