IIRC, it's an issue but there's no resolution as existing code may break.

There are also,
/proc/{interrupts, stat}
https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/11/7/340

/dev/pts/, /dev/tty*
https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/11/7/355

I have not checked the status of these issues. Vasiliy, kindly shed some
light.

Happy holidays.

Eugene
