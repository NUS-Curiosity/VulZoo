Subject: cve request: bat_socket_read memory corruption

Hi

can I get a CVE for this:
https://lists.open-mesh.org/pipermail/b.a.t.m.a.n/2011-December/005904.html
?

If root does read() on a specific socket, it's possible to corrupt
(kernel) memory over network, with an ICMP packet, if B.A.T.M.A.N. mesh
protocol is used.
