Subject: CVE request: Pidgin crash

Hi!  Would it be possible to issue a CVE for a newish crash in Pidgin?
 This is a remotely-triggerable crash in the oscar protocol (used by
the AIM and ICQ plugins) when handling incoming buddy list-related
SNACs.  I do not believe remote-code execution is possible.  It was
discovered by Evgeny Boger and reported on our public issue tracker at
http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/14682  I do not believe a CVE exists
for this yet.

The Pidgin project will be releasing version 2.10.1 tomorrow and it
will include a fix for this issue.

Thanks (and sorry for sending this at the beginning of your weekends!),
Mark
