Subject: CVE Request -- Asterisk -- AST-2011-013 and AST-2011-014

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   the following two security flaws have been recently fixed:
   http://www.asterisk.org/node/51693

in Asterisk:

1) AST-2011-013 Possible to enumerate SIP usernames when general and user/peer NAT settings differed

    An information disclosure flaw was found in the way Asterisk handled UDP
    requests in configurations using network address translation (NAT) for the SIP
    protocol. When the general configuration file section and user / peer
    configuration file section NAT settings differed, it was possible to enumerate
    SIP usernames if the request was sent to different port as that, specified in
    the Via header.

    Upstream patch (for 1.8 branch):

2) AST-2011-014 NULL pointer dereference (crash) when processing INFO automon message
    with no channel

    A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way Asterisk handled INFO
    requests, when the 'automon' feature was enabled. If no channel had been
    created yet, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service
    (asterisk crash) by sending an INFO request.
