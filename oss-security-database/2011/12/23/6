For "these types" (what types?) of proc related issues, or for all
infoleak issues related to procfs?  To me, a timing attack based on data
in a world-readable proc file is totally different from a data leak via
fd preserved across SUID exec.  Thus, a CVE (non-)assignment decision
for one of these should have nothing to do with CVE (non-)assignment for
the other.
