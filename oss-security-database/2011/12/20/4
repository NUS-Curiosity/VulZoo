Subject: Re: CVE assignment from previous years


Note that the year does NOT include when the vuln was found (and if it was 
silently fixed, that's not a factor either).

The year is almost always obtained from either:

1) When the CVE was first privately reserved.  We already have more than
    two hundred CVE-2012-XXXX numbers reserved for various CNAs who are
    using them to coordinate disclosures that are scheduled to
    happen in 2012.  This date often correlates with the year that the vuln
    was found, but not always.

2) When the issue was first made public.  There can be some disagreement
    about when a vuln is first published (e.g. a bug report may lie
    unresolved, technically viewable by anybody, for a few years before it
    reaches general awareness, or something might be published on December
    31 in one part of the world when it is January 1 in another part of the
    world.)

Some CNAs who have a pool of CVEs from one year, will continue to use that 
pool in the next year if there are any CVEs left over, though I generally 
discourage it.

In January and February 2012, you will probably still see a fairly large 
number of new CVE-2011-xxxx identifiers released, as MITRE/etc. assign 
CVEs to issues that were first published in 2011.
