Right, my thought/comment is more around the point that this isn't
defined in general very well anywhere (that I can find, and I assume
OpenPAM and Linux PAM are going to implement things in a roughly similar
manner) and that it probably should be defined better. In the meantime
though it is likely that restrictions/filtering can be implemented but
it needs to be done carefully since there is the potential for weirdness.
