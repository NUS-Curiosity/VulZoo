The secunia page lists 3 CVE's and 4 issues with no mappings to CVE's to
issues that I can see. Can you reply with the mapping information that
you used to determine that this issue was not assigned a CVE (as opposed
to one of the other issues)?. Also can you confirm or proove that these
4 issues are all separate and that two of them have not been merged
(thus obviating any need for a third CVE)? Thanks in advance. If anyone
from Secunia is on this list I'd love to hear from you/any comments on
this issue are more then welcome.
