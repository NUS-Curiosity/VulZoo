Subject: CVE-request for three 2009 Joomla issues (second part)

Can I get three CVEs assigned for these issues:

1) "Input passed via the "HTTP_REFERER" is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site."

http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/55589

2) "Input passed via the URL is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site."

http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/55590

3) "A security issue exists due to certain files missing the check for JEXEC, which can lead to the disclosure of path information."
