Subject: kernel: CVE-2011-2482/2519

CVE-2011-2482 sctp DoS
This does not affect the upstream kernel. Our kernel left out a chunk of
upstream ea2bc483ff5 that was not needed at the time of the backport,
but was later required for a feature that we introduced in the kernel.

CVE-2011-2519 xen: x86_emulate: fix SAHF emulation
This has been addressed in the upstream xen implementation. The patched
code would cause a hypervisor crash due to dereferencing a bogus address
(in the first 4 MBs of address space, as EFLAGS bits above bit 21 are
always 0, but more likely in the first page).
