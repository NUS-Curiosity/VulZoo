Subject: CVE request: Pidgin crash

Hi!  Would it be possible to issue a CVE for a new crash in Pidgin?

"Certain characters in the nicknames of IRC users can trigger a null
pointer dereference in the IRC protocol plugin's handling of responses
to WHO requests. This can cause a crash on some operating systems.
Clients based on libpurple 2.8.0 through 2.9.0 are affected."

The crash was discovered by Djego Ibanez.

Thanks,
Mark
