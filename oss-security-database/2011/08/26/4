Hi Sebastian,

Thanks for doing this review, this issue is now being tracked in the 
LightDM issue tracker:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/+bug/834079

Not sure what you mean in your question about the PAM sessions.  The 
greeter object inside the daemon creates PAMSession objects which 
attempt to be authenticated, then passes the successful one to the 
session code which starts the PAM session.  Might just be bad naming 
causing confusion?  (I've been meaning to split this into 
PAMAuthentication and PAMSession objects).
