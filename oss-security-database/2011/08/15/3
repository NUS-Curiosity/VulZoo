Subject: kernel: ext3/4: ext3/4_symlink lock oops

Some fun with long symlinks on ext3/4 fs with selinux on. This issue was
introduced in upstream commits ae54870a and df5e6223 (v3.0-rc1). I'm not
requesting a CVE name as I don't think anyone is affected by this issue
(I hope).

Upstream commits:
ext3: http://git.kernel.org/linus/d2db60df1e7eb39cf0f378dfc4dd8813666d46ef
ext4: http://git.kernel.org/linus/8c20871998c082f6fbc963f1449a5ba5140ee39a

Thanks, Eugene
