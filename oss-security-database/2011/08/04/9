  Just wondering, are you by chance changing the libxml2 buffer allocation
strategy in the application code (function xmlSetBufferAllocationScheme())
and associated global variable (I know I know ...) xmlBufferAllocScheme.
That may explain if you switched to an exact allocation policy why
you hit the buffer overrun while it usually doesn't show up,
