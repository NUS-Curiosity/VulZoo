Subject: Re: CVE-request: FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD(?) ftpd remote crash (2010)

:Can I get 2010 CVE-ID for this issue? I am not sure if other distributions/operating systems need their own IDs. If I am correct one ID should be enough.

:Original discussion: http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2010/Mar/117
:Bug report to FreeBSD: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=144761
:NetBSD: http://www.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/query-pr-single.pl?number=43023
:Reported to OpenBSD (and patched), but can't find references.

FWIW, a reference for OpenBSD is:

ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/4.5/common/013_ftpd.patch
