Hi Josh,

As patches are either being worked on currently or finished for the
various affected products that we're aware of, I think we'll get those
committed, give the packagers a 48-hour heads-up, and then we'll just
put the details on this list. Then you can assign CVEs as appropriate
and we can reference those in the various security advisories.

Does that sound good?

Thanks,
Jeff
