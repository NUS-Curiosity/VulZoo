I'm being told that even if this is 2001 fix, it's ok to use 2011 CVE
if this was not called security before.  Hence use CVE-2011-2897 if you
plan to fix.

Just to clarify, the above was about RHEL gtk2 packages.  For most
distros, that implies they don't really need to look at their gtk2
packages if it's fixed in the oldest supported RHEL.  I've not really
tried to figure out if there was any upstream gtk2 version that did not
have the fix though.

I'm FYI CCing gnome security to reduce the amount of confusion this can
possibly cause.  This is follow-up on:
