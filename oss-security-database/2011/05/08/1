Subject: CVE request: kernel: DCCP invalid options

On a providing a bad option length for certain DCCP options, a remote
host may cause parsing to read beyond the bounds of the incoming
packet.  This may possibly cause a DoS by reading unmapped memory (if
you're unlucky), or it may allow an attacker to infer the contents of
kernel heap memory based on the parser's response.
