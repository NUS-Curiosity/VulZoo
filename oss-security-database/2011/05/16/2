Subject: CVE Request -- pmake -- Use of insecure temporary file for 'depend'
 target


Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it was found that pmake (BSD 4.4 version of make) used insecure
temporary file for 'depend' target when building libraries (/usr/share
/mk/bsd.lib.mk) and executables (/usr/share/mk/bsd.prog.mk). A local
attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks possibly
leading to their ability to replace content of arbitrary files,
belonging to user running the pmake tool or ability to modify the
integrity of .depend file in the home directory of the victim.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.
