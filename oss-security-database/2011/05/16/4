Subject: CVE requests; issues fixed in MySQL 5.1.52

I see the following changes as fixed in MySQL 5.1.52, but cannot find
any CVEs for them:

InnoDB Storage Engine: Security Fix: Issuing TRUNCATE TABLE and
examining the same table's information in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA
database at the same time could cause a crash in the debug version of
the server. (Bug #54678)

Security Fix: The server crashed for assignment of values of types other
than Geometry to items of type GeometryCollection (MultiPoint,
MultiCurve, MultiSurface). Now the server checks the field type and
fails with bad geometry value if it detects incorrect parameters. (Bug
#55531)

Security Fix: EXPLAIN EXTENDED caused a server crash with some prepared
statements. (Bug #54494)

Security Fix: In prepared-statement mode, EXPLAIN for a SELECT from a
derived table caused a server crash. (Bug #54488)

There are a whole bunch of other crash-type bugs corrected in 5.1.52
that upstream did not explicitly flag as security, which might be
considered security-relevant as well:
