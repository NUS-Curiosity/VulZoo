Good idea.

glibc exports the __libc_enable_secure variable, which is initialized
based on AT_* including AT_SECURE.  It also exports __secure_getenv().

We've been patching OpenSSL to use __libc_enable_secure for over 10
years now. ;-)  The patch is in use at least in Owl and ALT Linux.

- Use glibc's __libc_enable_secure for the new OPENSSL_issetugid().

I've attached our patches for OpenSSL, ncurses, S-Lang, termcap, rpm's
popt.  Of these, OpenSSL and ncurses apply to recent versions, termcap
is old by itself, whereas the rest might be obsoleted by changes made
upstream (and they're not strictly for the problem you brought up).

For OpenSSL, there's another problem: it looks like some getenv()'s
were added after the initial introduction of OPENSSL_issetugid() and
without consideration for possible security implications.  Some of those
should be patched.  This got on my to-do when we updated to OpenSSL
1.0.0d earlier this year - to do myself or delegate, but I never got
around to...  Maybe you're the one to look into this and come up with a
patch now? ;-)

Thanks,

Alexander
