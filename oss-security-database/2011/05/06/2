Subject: CVE request: tigervnc

The vncviewer in tigervnc had X.509 certificate support added in svn
r4200 (currently beta, slated for the 1.1.0 release).  It would prompt
for and send authentication credentials before properly validating the
X.509 certificate, which makes it susceptible to a man-in-the-middle
attack.
