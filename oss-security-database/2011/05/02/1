Subject: CVE request: libmodplugin stack-buffer overflow

Some details and exploit at:
http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17222/

>From an initial look, it seems that applications embedding libmodplug,
sp gstreamer-plugins may not be affected, since it seems to be doing
some parameter checking before hand.

Can a CVE be assigned to this please?
