RHEL-like .src.rpm's or equivalent will do.  Something else might do.

While we're at it, just what software do MontaVista and Wind River ship?
My guess is that embedded Linux distro vendors would not care about
vulnerabilities in desktop-specific apps (e.g., the X server), but I
could be wrong.  And there are other software categories, which may or
may not be relevant.  It'd be nice for potential reporters of security
issues to know which vendors might be affected.
