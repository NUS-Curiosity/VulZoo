Most embedded Linux distributors don't have any concept of src.rpm or
equivalent.  We primarily ship patches to our build infrastructure and meta-data
in "some format".  Be it as patch files, installer "fragements", etc.

This is a more reasonable approach for the Embedded Linux distributors.  But
keep in mind that due to our IT infrastructures and such, don't expect this type
of change overnight.  However, if it would allow our participation in the closed
lists we are certainly interested.

I am a bit confused though.  If I (as a non-RH customer) look to download their
latest security updates, I don't see an obvious way of doing it based on their
advisories.  For instance:

https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0421.html

This advisory ends with:  (The unlinked packages above are only available from
the Red Hat Network)

This requires that I have a support account in order to download the update.
This is certainly different from the "Open" distributions, such as Fedora... but
really isn't different from what Wind River is doing -- other then perhaps the
verbose description of the issue.
