Subject: CVE request: libgnomesu privilege escalation

Hi,

The /usr/lib/libgnomesu/gnomesu-pam-backend suid binary which belongs
to the libgnomesu package is not checking setuid() return values.

As a result, two cooperating users, or users with access to guest,
cgi or web accounts can run arbitrary commands as root very easily.
Attacker just needs to 'su' to this account where he knows the password
from inside the second account and take care that enough zombie
processes exist at the target account.

A patch is attached in our bugzilla:
