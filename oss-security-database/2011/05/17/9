Yes, absolutely; 2.9.21 and 2.9.21a (diff between .21 and .21a is a
documentation-related file that wasn't added to Makefile.am). The bug
was introduced with this commit:

http://nbd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=nbd/nbd;a=commit;h=9ea4e742ce6f1b7793d1edfca70427a8660aeffa

To be 100% sure, I just checked out the tree at the 2.9.20 tag and
recompiled; I couldn't reproduce it.
