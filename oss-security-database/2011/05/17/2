Subject: CVE Request -- Cyrus-IMAP STARTTLS issue -- [was: Re: 
 pure-ftpd STARTTLS command injection / new CVE?]


Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it was reported that Cyrus-IMAP is also prone to the CVE-2011-0411 
issue (in IMAP, LMTP, NNTP, POP3, .. protocols):
[1] http://bugzilla.cyrusimap.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3424

Relevant upstream patch:
[2] 
http://git.cyrusimap.org/cyrus-imapd/patch/?id=523a91a5e86c8b9a27a138f04a3e3f2d8786f162

References:
[3] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=705288

To my knowledge the list of CVE-2011-0411 related CVEs:

CVE-2011-0411 Postfix
CVE-2011-1430 Ipswich IMAIL
CVE-2011-1431 1431 netqmail
CVE-2011-1432 SCO Soffice Server
CVE-2011-1575 pure-ftpd

does not include Cyrus case yet (but not sure this list being
complete, so worthy of double-checking).

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.
