Subject: CVE request: nbd-server 

Hi,

In Debian the following was reported:
nbd-server 2.9.21 has a NULL-pointer dereference in its negotiation
phase, which allows unauthenticated users to DoS the server by causing
the negotiation to fail (e.g., by specifying a non-existing name for an
export).

Filed as http://bugs.debian.org/627042. This affects only 2.9.21 so for us
goes that only our unstable distribution is affected.

We'd like to have a CVE name for this.


Cheers,
Thijs
