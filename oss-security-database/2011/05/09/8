Subject: Re: CVE request : client-side file creation via XSLT
 in Webkit


All,

Note that due to all the Apple/Google confusion, we recently arranged for 
Google to become a CVE CNA (i.e. have their own CVEs), and now they are 
the primary coordinator for CVE assignment in Webkit issues (specifically, 
Chris Evans).  Not sure whether the current issue has CVE coverage or not.
