Hi Huzaifa,

I have generated some patches to address the CVE. However, I have not yet address the http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=624212#19 related to the "echo do_jitconv > $SESSION_DIR/opd_pipe"

I will send the the patches from my local git branch in a moment.

Any feedback would be appreciated.
