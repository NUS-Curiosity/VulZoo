I was thinking more in the direction of an existing config that includes
a wildcard and software that uses user input to construct file names
that would be matched by that wildcard. An example of such software
would be samba, which tends to create per-client-host log files named
after those hosts. I don't have a clue whether samba could be made to
include any shell meta characters (does it even do reverse lookups for
that?), but I guess you get the idea.
