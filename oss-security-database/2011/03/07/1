I still see some value in having a closed mailing list for vendor 
co-ordination.

Having many sub-lists will make this overly complicated. I think it is 
more effective to have just one mailing list like before that everyone 
can remember.

We should just CC security@k.o on relevant messages. Do bear in mind 
that any information shared with this list will have no CRD, and will be 
fixed almost immediately (well, most of the time).

Even if we were to use GPG, we should assume that the reports will be 
leaked anyway. One way as SD has mentioned is to use a short CRD. 
Another way is to perhaps change our approach of informing issues:-

If there is an issue that we will need to co-ordinate with the rest of 
the vendors, we will inform everyone with a very brief description of 
the vulnerability. Just enough to find out if you are affected, but not 
enough to actually pin-point the exact issue. And if you want to find 
out more about it, email the vendor directly. This way, we will know who 
we shared the information to, and if there is a leak, we can narrow it 
down easily. All email conversations should be encrypted at all times. 
The only exception to this is when we receive reports from third-party 
researchers. This is the time we should use a short embargo.

Agree. We have been doing that for kernel issues. By making low severity 
issues public right away makes dealing with updates easier.
