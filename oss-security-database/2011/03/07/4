As suggested by Josh Bressers oCERT would be favourable to providing a system
that would accept user submission and allow selection of security contacts
from our existing member database as well as other verified contacts.

As Josh pointed out we do this already (even if manually and not with a web
selection thing or whatever) and I am open to explore ways to create more
cooperation.

We would also be willing to host and maintain a closed vendor-sec style
mailing list like the previous one with the only condition for member list to
be public (not necessarily the individual contact names but at least the
entities represented).

Cheers
