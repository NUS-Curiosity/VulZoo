Subject: CVE request: VLC bookmark buffer overflow

Can I get CVE-identifier for this issue:

"VLC media player is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack when processing .mp3 file and its metadata. It fails to perform boundry checks when creating a bookmark from the malicious media file playing, resulting in a crash, overwriting ECX register. While the evil .mp3 is playing, you go Playback > Bookmarks > Manage bookmarks > Create."
