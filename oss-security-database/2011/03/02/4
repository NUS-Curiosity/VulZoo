I almost gave this a single CVE for "multiple unspecified" but there's a 
readable patch file that gives more hints:
http://custom.simplemachines.org/mods/downloads/smf_patch_2.0-RC4_security.zip


Reversing the patches suggests the following (assuming that ONLY security 
patches are included in the ZIP, as stated in the initial post).


CVE-2011-1127 - guest access to SSI.php

CVE-2011-1128 - "brute force" on Load.php

CVE-2011-1129 - ManageNews.php, probably XSS

CVE-2011-1130 - improper input validation for a number in
   $_REQUEST['start'] in QueryString.php, and also $start variable in
   Subs.php

CVE-2011-1131 - unspecified query issues in Search.php, related to 
$createTemporary variable.
