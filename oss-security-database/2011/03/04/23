As already stated, projects can make requests from the cve@...re address. 
While we try to respond within 48 business hours, unfortunately that 
doesn't always happen.  But sometimes you get a response within 2 minutes 
:-)  This year, I hope to improve our responsiveness with some internal 
process improvements.
