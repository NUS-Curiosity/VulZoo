First off, we are way off-topic from the original topic here, very sorry
about that.

That is the point of security@ list.  Many people on this very list
asked for this type of alias years ago, so don't go and say that now you
don't want it :)

That is what stable@ can be used for, please feel free to do that there
today.

How can we be more open than we are today by showing you _all_ of the
patches that we are deeming as "fixes"?

You want people to somehow magically categorize patches, and that's not
going to happen because it's complicated and usually not known until
after the fact.  Way after the fact.

So again, take a look at stable@...nel.org, it shows you all of these
patches and you can start classifying them if you wish to.
