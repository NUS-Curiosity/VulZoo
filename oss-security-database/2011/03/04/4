They do this already today, that's what security@...nel.org is for, and
it gets a bit of traffic like this every week.

I actually use that traffic to watch out for things that need to make
sure they go into the stable releases.  Those patches are then posted to
stable@...nel.org when they are public, so you can watch that list if
you want.

It's not, but if all you want to do is make sure the patch is applied to
the stable trees as you think it's a potential problem, just copy stable
instead.  That's what happens today.

Again, just try to start out by watching stable@...nel.org and writing
up summaries for the patches it applies and releases.  I think you
severly underestimate the work involved.  But hey, what do I know, I
could be totally wrong, it wouldn't be the first time today that
happened :)
