This proposal just fell down right there, as it has been rightly pointed
out that numerous bug fixes in the kernel in the past have later been
deemed "security fixes".  So what you are asking for is for _all_
bugfixes to be sent to such a list.

Well, we have that already, we have mailing lists that get every single
patch that is merged into the kernel, and there's the big lkml list as
well with hundreds of fixes posted every week.

I don't think you understand the rate of change in the kernel and how
trying to do this for every commit is unfeasable and unworkable.  You do
know how fast it goes, right?

I would be happy if someone could just document the patches that _are_
applied to stable kernel releases.  I bet you can't keep up with that,
they are moving so fast.

Sorry, I don't think this is workable as you are proposing, but feel
free to prove me wrong :)
