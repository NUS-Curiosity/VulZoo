Subject: RE: Vendor-sec hosting and future of closed lists

Thanks Eugene,

I have been looking at how to contribute in FOSS and security, and for me
it's been in the area of how to understand what vulnerabilities are already
documented.  I might think about looking more at the kernel changelogs and
LKML lists.

For sure, I'll look for some bugs while I am at it, tho.
