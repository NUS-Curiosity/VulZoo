Claiming that the system is only reachable via local network while
it's not doesn't sound correct to me either. However, how would a
fix look like? A program basically can't know nor reliably determine
whether it's reachable from outside. Private IP addresses are no
indication either. So the only sane thing seems to be to not make
any claims about local networks and just list the IP addresses/host
names of the system.
