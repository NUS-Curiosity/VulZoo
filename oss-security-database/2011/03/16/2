Many of the kernel vulnerabilities I have seen over the past two years 
at least, were reported and fixed upstream. Only a handful of them were 
reported privately. I can't remember when was the last time we had a 
kernel issue reported via vendor-sec. There were, but it must have been 
quite some time ago. LKML is still one of the better places to find 
vulnerabilities :) Contributions welcomed.
