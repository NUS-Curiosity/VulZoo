Thanks for making this public. I know it can be hard to bring something
like this up.

For those of you who don't know Solar Designer hosts oss-security.

I've thought about this a lot. I think the answer is probably. There are
still reasons to need good cooperation between vendors (this is different
than coordination, which is what the CERTs do, which generally doesn't
bring the affected parties together to work on a solution, they generally
just distribute information).

This is a big challenge. It's also really hard to decide who should get to
be a part of such a group. Historically vendor-sec was only vendors, but
there are a number researchers who would be useful for example (but again,
who do you choose).

My only fear with this is complexity (I'll propse a far more complex
idea below).

I suspect it's fairly well understood that the current vendor-sec model was
broken. Very few "members" ever contributed, which made the list more of an
announce venue.

If I had my way (and we had infinite time and resources), I would opt for a
solution that let the reporter decide who they wanted to inform. Have a
system in place that could handle properly encrypting the traffic, then
somehow (web page?) let a reporter decide who to alert. This list of
potential recipients could include vendors, other upstream projects,
researchers, CERTs, ... the possibilities are endless.

Such a system would remove the whole group idea, as nobody gets "left out",
but rather included. Perhaps oCERT would be interested in helping with such
an idea? They sort of already do this, but we'd want to create more
cooperation than there previously exists.

Anyhow, thanks for the update.
