Subject: Re: CVE Request -- Erlang/OTP R14, Erlang/OTP R14B01, Erlang/OTP
 R14B02 -- multiple security fixes

Hi!

I can only answer for my fixes, answers for the rest will come from the 
respective developer (hopefully soon :))

OTP-7178: Not a security issue, just a "bugfix", the "underflow" is 
floating point conversion underflow, not buffer related.
OTP-8827: Definitely a security fix
OTP-8943: Also a security fix

Cheers,
/Patrik, OTP
