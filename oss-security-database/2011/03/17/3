Subject: CVE Request: xen DoS

Hi,

http://xenbits.xen.org/hg/staging/xen-unstable.hg/rev/c79aae866ad8

Citing https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=679344:
"The problem is that a 64-bit guest can get one of its vcpus into
non-kernel mode without first providing a valid non-kernel pagetable.
The iret-into-userspace path has the right checks, but just setting the
context on a fresh vcpu doesn't. :(  The observed failure mode is
usually a hard lockup of the host."

Ludwig
