Subject: CVE request for Asterisk flaws

Two flaws were fixed in Asterisk:

AST-2011-003: http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2011-003.pdf
- resource exhaustion DoS in Asterisk Manager Interface

AST-2011-004: http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2011-003.pdf
- DoS in TCP/TLS server due to NULL ptr deref

Could CVE names be assigned to these issues?

Thanks!
