I imagine that mount's -f (fake mount by editing mtab) and -n (mount 
without editing mtab) options are not going to work if /etc/mtab becomes 
a symbolic link to /proc/mounts, so that's liable to break a few things. 
  In the long run it does seem like a good plan, but there might be a 
few bumps in the road.  I wonder what the rationale was for faking mtab 
mounts in the first place?
