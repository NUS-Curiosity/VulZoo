Subject: CVE Request / Discussion -- vino -- reports the desktop being reachable
 only over the local network, when reachable from everywhere

Hello Josh, Steve, David, vendors,

   this is due the following vino deficiency:
   [1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=553477#c0
   [2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=678846

As noted in [1] Vino may incorrectly report, that relevant user desktop
is reachable only over local network, when in fact it's reachable from everywhere.

As this is issue slightly on the border, not sure it should receive a CVE identifier,
so Cc-ed David Woodhouse to elaborate more on issue impact if necessary.

Under my opinion, the trust boundary is crossed (it is wrongly reported to the the user, they
have a secure setup, when they do not have it and otherwise would perform steps to correct the
settings). But left the final decision for further discussion.

What are the thoughts of the others? Should this one get a CVE identifier or not?

Upstream bug report:
[3] https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=596190

Ubuntu bug report (IPv6 specific):
[4] https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vino/+bug/344489

To David King -- David, what are the upstream plans for this issue? Is there by any
chance upstream patch for the bug [3] yet?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.
