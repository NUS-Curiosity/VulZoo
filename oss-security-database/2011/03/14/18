Subject: CVE request for python-feedparser

python-feedparser 5.0.1 fixes three flaws:

https://code.google.com/p/feedparser/

* Fix  issue 91  (invalid text in XML declaration causes sanitizer to crash)
* Fix  issue 254  (sanitization can be bypassed by malformed XML comments)
* Fix  issue 255  (sanitizer doesn't strip unsafe URI schemes) 

Could CVE names be assigned to these issues?

It looks like the last two issues were introduced in 5.0, the first
issue was reported against 4.1.

Thanks.
