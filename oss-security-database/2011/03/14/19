I only took over the Vino maintainership 10 days ago, so I am not 
familiar with all parts of the code yet, including this one. Now that I 
have been notified of the issue, I will work on fixing it, but for the 
next stable release (GNOME 3.0), due in a few weeks, I think that it 
will be safest to disable this functionality.

As for the UPnP issue listed at [2], I was planning to fix this during 
the GNOME 3.2 release cycle, as it will require changing translatable 
strings, and the project is already in a string freeze. The upstream bug 
has some more details:

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=594521

I could also disable this functionality as a workaround.
