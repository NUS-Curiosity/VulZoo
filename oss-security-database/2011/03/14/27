I'd concur with the former, but not the latter. Issuing a CVE for that
kind of thing just encourages the people who mistakenly view NAT as a
form of security. uPnP is just one of the *many* reasons that viewpoint
is wrong.

If you wouldn't issue a CVE for vino listening with socket() and bind()
system calls, then you shouldn't issue a CVE for it using uPnP to listen
either. uPnP is just the normal way to work around broken networking.

As far as I'm concerned there is only one issue here; the misreporting
that only local access is possible when in fact it's not.
