It all depends on how this process is going to be handled. I can see oCERT
helping in routing reports to the proper contacts via email to our trusted
member contacts as well as external ones that we can seek on a report basis.

Once the report is routed to the contact list I don't expect the handling
process to be different from what was happening on vendor-sec already. (if
you think about it, it would just be like creating ad-hoc aliases list where
we just make sure only affected parties are included, unlike vendor-sec used
to work).

Of course we would monitor handling and try to be a pain :) in case we see
things progressing slowly and, more importantly for us, we would eventually
disclose the information like we do already once the report is handled.

So I don't think 2) is going to be too much of a concern also because putting
a lot of extra process would become a problem re 1).

It is true that we would need to expand our team and we would be happy to do
that, it just requires an evaluation process as clearly only trusted contacts
can be accepted (there are several from the old vendor-sec that we would be
really happy to work with actually).

This is a simplified approach compared to what we do now, which is contacting
project maintainers first, negotiating embargo as well as requesting a patch
that we can verify and relay to vendors, spread the patch to affected parties
along with embargo information and coordinate disclosure. This is a
time-consuming process that worked very well with oCERT because the number of
reports was limited, it helped solving complex bugs or vulnerabilities that
affected a large number of projects.

I think we can continue to do this for selected cases but it would be hard to
scale enough to support this "tailored" approach for every single report if
we expand our visibility, additionally I think everyone would favour less
extra process as pointed out already.

I don't think this is an issue. We positively worked with other CERTs when that
was applicable anyway.

I agree, all of these are some of the reasons that made us creating oCERT in
the first place.

Above all things we value having a published member list and having an open
disclosure process of what happened once the reports have been handled
opposed to the "opacity" that vendor-sec had in the past.

If eventually recreating the old list is going to be the favoured option I
hope that we can find a way to address these concerns.
