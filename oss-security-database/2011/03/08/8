Subject: glibc locale escaping issue

Hi!

Following glibc upstream and gentoo bug reports describe a bug in the
way locale command escapes its output.

http://sources.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11904
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330923

Gentoo bug points out possible security implications.  I've not managed
to find an example where the locale command is used in a problematic way
and where this may cross trust boundaries, so I wonder if this is worth
handling as security fix vs. security enhancement.  Comments are
welcome.

The issue was fixed in GLSA 201011-01, but its text really only
mentions Tavis' issues.
