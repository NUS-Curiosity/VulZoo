It seems like fixing glibc to either raise the rlimit or correctly handle
the error condition is the way to go (as you already mentioned). I share
the concern of the helpers maybe not checking addmntent() return codes,
though. If they all do, I would think that just correct error handling
in glibc would be accepted upstream. Whatever the fix, it really feels like
it should be in glibc. It is what is responsible for actually writing to
the file...
