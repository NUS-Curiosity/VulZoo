This means that for a "normal" Linux distribution, someone would have to
be subscribed to at least 2 lists, and possibly three?

And where would someone post a problem to?  How would they know if a
pacakge is shared from BSD and Linux without having to do a lot of
research first?

I really don't mind seeing all of the traffic for all of the issues, but
perhaps the BSD developers get tired of seeing all of the Linux kernel
issues go across their mailbox so they don't want to have to see them
anymore :)

Either way, I think we still need a vendor-sec-like list for the
Linux distros, as it is very invaluable and provides a way to coordinate
things that is needed at times.
