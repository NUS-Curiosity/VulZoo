Subject: Request 2 CVE-IDs for Zeus Voting System

Zeus (https://github.com/grnet/zeus) is a fork of Helios that is actively developed by GRNET (http://www.grnet.gr/) and is considered to be used in Greek Elections (starts with small and rolls out to larger elections). 

Two XSS vulnerabilities that allow JavaScript Execution have been found, one of which has a PoC running JavaScript / Modifying HTML in the voterâ€™s browser during the voting process.

XSS #1 - https://github.com/grnet/zeus/issues/28
XSS #2 - https://github.com/grnet/zeus/issues/29

Thank you,
Antonios A. Chariton
