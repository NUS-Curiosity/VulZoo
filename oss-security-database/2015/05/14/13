Which apparently haven't landed in the kernel? The last commit
mentioning bind mounts I could find is 8f502d5b9e336297, which says:

      The issue of being able to escape a bind mount has not yet been
      addressed, as the fixes are not yet mature"

And the public security issue trackers of Debian, Ubuntu and Redhat
also say that the issue hasn't been fixed:

This issue now is nearly 5 months old. :/
