We are assigning only one CVE ID for this. Use CVE-2015-3988.

It appears that 1449260 became a public security bug on 2015-05-01 in
https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1449260/comments/6 and then an
additional attack vector (Host Aggregates) was first mentioned in
https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1449260/comments/10 on
2015-05-04. However, there would apparently be no reasonable way to
independently address only the attack vectors that were identified
earlier. Also, apparently the completely general description of
vectors came in from IBM (e.g., "all the other things that have
metadata" in
https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1449260/comments/9 on
2015-05-04). Accordingly, it doesn't appear that an additional CVE ID
could be useful to anyone.
