Given the nature of the task (decoding network traffic, which is quite
often truncated or malicious, in C) and the wide protocol support, it's
no big surprise that this type of bug shows up so frequently.

I always thought it was a pity that Wireshark's privilege separation
only concerns itself with handling captures as root while running the
main body of the program as a normal userid (rather than specifically
running the risky code, i.e. the dissectors, jailed as an unprivileged
user).
