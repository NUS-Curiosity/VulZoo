Yes, MITRE is able to provide a CVE ID. (We will do this soon,
regardless of the outcome below.)

What apparently occurred in the previous case this week was that the
WordPress plugin changelog URL was sent here, then the CVE ID was sent
here, and then the CVE ID was used on fulldisclosure, i.e.,

  http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/18/8
  http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/18/10
  http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/May/75

The MITRE CVE project is currently willing to follow that pattern for
some number of WordPress plugin disclosures. A possible advantage for
other people is receiving notification of security-relevant plugin
changelogs earlier. A possible disadvantage for other people is three
times as many public messages per disclosure. If this disadvantage is
very important, you can (among other options) send e-mail directly to
only cve-assign@...re.org to tell us. As far as we know, the list
guidelines at
http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security would
imply that all of:

  http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/18/8
  http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/20/6
  http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/22/2

are "Public security issues" that oss-security subscribers might want
to know about.
