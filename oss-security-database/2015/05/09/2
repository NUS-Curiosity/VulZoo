Subject: Request for CVE - XSS Vulnerabilities in Wordpress Roomcloud plugin
 v1.1(rev @1115307)

Hi,

I found a few XSS vulnerabilities in the Wordpress Roomcloud plugin
v1.1(rev @1115307) which was informed to the developer and fixed in
v1.1(rev @@1117499).

Could I please get a CVE assigned to this?
