These examples all seem to require specific code (like
'md5(str_repeat("a", 4294967294-1));') to be run. The probability that
applications would contain this specific code with str_repeat argument
controlled by remote user seems to be pretty low. However, if you can
show exploiting this on a code of an application that is not specially
crafted to demonstrate this issue, or at least resembles code that is
likely to be deployed in a real application, I will gladly change my
opinion.
