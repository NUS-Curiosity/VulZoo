Subject: Re: CVE Request + Advisory: PHP str_repeat() sign mismatch based
 memory corruption

Hi!

I do not think this requires a CVE as this needs specially crafted PHP
script (i.e. local access or ability to run arbitrary PHP code) and
memory settings allowing to allocate huge (>4G) values, which seems to
be unlikely to happen on a common production system. I am not sure how
remote code execution vector can be provided for this issue, if you have
an example, please clarify.

Thanks,
