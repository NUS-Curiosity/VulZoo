2.2.14.
But things are comlicated: There was some breakage in 2.2.13 regarding
TLS so some distros (I know this from Gentoo) backported some TLS
related patches to 2.2.13, therefore you could also see it there.

Also, you'll probably only see this with SSLv3 disabled. (at least
that's the only situation where this particular crash in openssl can be
triggered, but there may be other codepaths affected by that problem)
