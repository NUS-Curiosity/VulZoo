Subject: CVE Request: zeromq downgrade attack

[ CCing upstream mailing list ]

Hello,

From https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/1273 :

> It is easy to bypass the security mechanism in 4.1.0 and 4.0.5 by sending a
> ZMTP v2 or earlier header. The library accepts such connections without
> applying its security mechanism.
> 
> Solution: if security is defined on a socket, reject all V2 and earlier
> connections, unconditionally.

A patch for the zeromq 4.0.x stable series is available at
https://github.com/zeromq/zeromq4-x/commit/b6e3e0f601e2c1ec1f3aac880ed6a3fe63043e51

AFAICT no CVE has been assigned (or requested) for this, and the issue has
been public since December of last year.

Could a CVE be assigned please?

Cheers
