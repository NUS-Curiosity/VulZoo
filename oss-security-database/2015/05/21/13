Subject: CVE Request for ceph-deploy copying keyring to /etc/ceph which is world readable

Hi,

"ceph-deploy admin" command pushes the client.admin key with world readable 
permissions as in /etc/ceph/ceph.client.admin.keyring, It is similar issue 
like CVE-2015-3010 , but this seems more bad as it is copying to /etc/ceph 
which readable by any user. 

~]# ls -Z /etc/ | grep ceph
drwxr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:etc_t:s0 ceph
