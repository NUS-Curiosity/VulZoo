Subject:  CVE-2015-3206 python-kerberos: checkPassword() does not verify KDC authenticity

Hello!

Red Hat has assigned CVE-2015-3206 to the following issue:

https://www.calendarserver.org/ticket/833
"The python-kerberos checkPassword() does verify that it actually spoke
to a trusted KDC"

Upstream has not fixed it, rather documented the insecurity of the
checkPassword() function. We feel that this is not a proper solution
given the fact that the pykerberos fork of this library did fix this
issue by adding KDC validation:

https://github.com/02strich/pykerberos/commit/02d13860b25fab58e739f0e000bed0067b7c6f9c
