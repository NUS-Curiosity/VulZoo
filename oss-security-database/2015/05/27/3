> only exist if you build with DEBUG_ASN1

As suggested in the
http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/01/29/10 post, unsafe
programming practices reachable in non-default builds are not within
the scope of CVE simply because the code exists. There must be
documentation indicating that an end user may wish to have the
applicable non-default build.

As far as we know, MIT Kerberos 5 does not document DEBUG_ASN1 for use
by end users. It seems reasonable to expect that those code sections
are only intended for use during development, and that there's a
cost/benefit tradeoff to addressing all possible risks to their
developers' machines. There won't be a CVE mapping for this DEBUG_ASN1
report unless the upstream vendor requests one.
