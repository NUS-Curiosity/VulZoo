Uh no. Has nothing to do with the config (you may mix this up with
another issue I recently reported to ssh regarding config parsing, but
that's unrelated).

It's an OOB triggered in the client by a specific banner string from the
server.

That's of course bogus.

One take away from this story for me - also after criticism I got on
twitter: The term "heap overflow" seems to be prone for
misunderstanding.
Some people consider every out of bounds thing an "overflow", some
think that only oob writes should be considered "overflows.

To avoid confusion I'll call similar issues "out of bounds read"
instead of "read heap overflow" in the future. Probably a wording less
prone to misunderstandings.

(address sanitizer calls every oob read a heap/stack/global buffer
overflow, that is the main reason I used that term in the past - I often
sticked to the wording address sanitizer used)
