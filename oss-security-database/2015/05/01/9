Using SSL/TLS in-house front ends is an entirely different animal than
breaking up end-to-end TLS encryption into multi-segmented pathways via
3rd party interposition.

I think your analogies are confusing the incentives and priorities of
different actors (service consumer, service provider, 3rd party
contractor).

My own lawyer analogy crystalizes things a bit more clearly:

Say you called your lawyer's cell phone but unbeknownst to you she's
been getting flooded by telemarkers. To help with this she's contracted
a call service that screens her incomings and transparently relays valid
calls. Maybe this service is trustworthy or maybe it just irreparably
deep-sixed your attorney-client privilege. The clincher is without doing
IMEI/TMSI analysis, you're unable to detect the interposition is even
there. Moreover, while your connection to the call center is A5/1
protected, the call center might be relaying to your lawyer in the
clear. You have no way of knowing from your end. s/lawyer/doctor/g etc.

Those are good suggestions for service providers seeking to outsource
part of their processes but not so relevant to grandma e-banking or
checking her medical results from her chalet in the Swiss Alps. As
grannie is finding out, more and more sensitive transactions are being
conducted over HTTPS these days. So, she's happy when she sees a lock in
the url bar and gets no alerts from Firefox. 

In recognition of this reality, browsers are assuming ever-increasing
roles in safeguarding the security of their users. Traditional measures
such as certificate validity checks and blocking weak primitives like
small DH moduli and MD5 are constantly being augmented with innovations
such as static pin lists, HKPK, etc. SSL/TLS libraries are similarly
evolving.

It is in within this evolving context that the increasing usage of
sanctioned TLS MITMs should be examined.
