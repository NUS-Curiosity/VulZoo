Subject: Re: On sanctioned MITMs

Hi,

I feel that this is borderline off-topic for oss-security because of no
specific relevance to Open Source, unless the discussion is somehow
refocused on aspects that are directly Open Source relevant - e.g.,
"should we block these CDNs (and how) in Open Source software's SSL/TLS
certificate validity checks because of those specific risks" - that's
just an example of what would bring the discussion on-topic for this
list, not an actual suggestion (I think such blocking would be bad).

I will only address an aspect that is on-topic here:

I've recently received an off-list inquiry from a company in this space
(a "sanctioned MITM" software and appliance vendor) on how they can
request distros list membership.  My reply included:

"According to what you wrote, Company Name should not be on distros, so
I would recommend that you not make the request.  However, to have it
fairly discussed (or not, as several of the recent on-hold requests
haven't been discussed to a point of acceptance or rejection), and
hopefully rejected, please feel free to post to the oss-security list."

This highlights that if/once we accept some closed source distro vendors
to distros, the next round of headache will be inquiries/requests from
vendors like these - and in fact at that point this won't seem as
unreasonable as it does to me now.  This is (obvious and expected)
slippery slope.  This makes me sad.
