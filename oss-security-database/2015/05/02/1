Subject: CVE Request / Saltstack SSL verification disabling for alibabab
 cloud module

Hi,

Could a CVE be assigned for this problem :

Saltstack do not verify certificate when connecting to Aliyun (Alibaba cloud service)
API on HTTPS
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/aliyun.py#L724


The same issue exist for the proxmox module :
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/cloud/clouds/proxmox.py#L115

And splunk:
https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/splunk_search.py#L168


This was found by running bandit on the source code
( https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Projects/Bandit )
