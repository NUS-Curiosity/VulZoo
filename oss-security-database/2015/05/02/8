Oh, so Android 4.3+ enables ping sockets for all apps by default?
I have mixed feelings about that.

I found no mistakes on your part - just too brief a message requiring
further analysis to determine actual impact of the bug.  The bug does
exist in all currently supported upstream kernel versions, as you say,
even if its security relevance varies from none to full local privesc
across archs and distros.

I expect they will post to oss-security.  Just give them some days.
