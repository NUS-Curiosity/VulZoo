But also ask why they might use it.  E.g., in the presence of a DDOS attack, many companies rely on infrastructure such as what Cloudflare provides in order to keep their services running.  By their nature, those mitigation services have to bust the SSL pipe to do what they do.

What I am not hearing anywhere in this conversation is a proposal for how Cloudflare can provide the service they do, but in a manner that doesn't require busting the SSL pipe in the middle.  There are MANY people begging for an answer to that.  Do you have it?  If not, are you prepared to see the services you "need" go offline when someone decides to DDOS the provider?

That's not a rhetorical question.  For some people, the answer is 'yes'.  But for most, it is 'no'.

In the specific Hushmail example, would it alleviate peoples concerns if the Cloudflare MITM-busting behaviour took place entirely inside Canada?  If not, how do you propose an alternative?  And what, exactly, is the attack vector you are trying to close down?  Is it the only one?  How do they interact?
