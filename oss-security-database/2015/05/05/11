====================================================================
OSSA-2015-008: Potential Keystone cache backend password leak in log
====================================================================

:Date: May 04, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2015-3646


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Keystone: versions through 2014.1.4,
            and 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.3


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Eric Brown from VMware reported a vulnerability in Keystone. The
backend_argument configuration option content is being logged, and it
may contain sensitive information for specific backends (like a
password for MongoDB). An attacker with read access to Keystone logs
may therefore obtain sensitive data about certain backends. All
Keystone setups are potentially impacted.
