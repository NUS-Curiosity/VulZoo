Subject: CVE Request: GnuTLS: GNUTLS-SA-2015-2: MD5-based ServerKeyExchange
 signature accepted by default

Hi

I wonder if the following issue in GnuTLS should get a CVE:

http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2015-2

> Karthikeyan Bhargavan reported that a ServerKeyExchange signature
> sent by the server is not verified to be in the acceptable by the
> client set of algorithms. That has the effect of allowing MD5
> signatures (which are disabled by default) in the ServerKeyExchange
> message. It is not believed that this bug can be exploited because a
> fraudulent signature has to be generated in real-time which is not
> known to be possible. However, since attacks can only get better it
> is recommended to update to a GnuTLS version which addresses the
> issue.
