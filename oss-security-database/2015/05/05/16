Thanks for taking a look.  Have you downloaded the Copr builds?

In 0092-ccpp-do-not-read-data-from-root-directories.patch for abrt, the
root directory argument for dd_create_basic_files is changed to NULL,
which means that the copying inside dd_create_basic_files will not
happen (although the code is still around).  As far as I can tell, this
patch is also applied in the build.  Is there some other copying
operation I'm missing?
