Subject: Re: hwclock(8) SUID privilege escalation

Itâ€™s not setuid root on my Ubuntu system.

larry@...p:~$ which hwclock
/sbin/hwclock
larry@...p:~$ ls -l /sbin/hwclock 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 46764 Feb 12 13:54 /sbin/hwclock
larry@...p:~$ uname -a
Linux meep 3.13.0-48-generic #80-Ubuntu SMP Thu Mar 12 11:16:18 UTC 2015 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux
larry@...p:~$ cat /etc/issue
Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS \n \l
