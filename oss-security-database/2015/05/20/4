Subject: JSON-based SQL query construction (Sequelize as an example)

We came across an issue which could deserve some wider attention: JSON
injection altering the structure of queries in certain ORM tools.

Already in July 2014, Kazuho Oku described a JSON injection issue in the
SQL::Maker Perl package, discovered by his colleague Toshiharu Sugiyama:

Additional SQL frameworks could be affected if they implement such
queries and are used with JSON frameworks which produce dict/hash
objects native to the programming language (so that they are
indistinguishable from query expressions).
