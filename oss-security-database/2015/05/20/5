Subject: CVE Request: SuiteCRM Post Auth RCE

Hi all,
CVE request here for a post auth RCE in the SuiteCRM (7.5.1 at least,
probably earlier versions too, but have to get time to test those)
software. Deadline has expired without contact from vendor, so disclosing.

The vulnerability is a simple shell upload via avoiding a rather rubbish
blacklist used to try (and fail) to prevent the upload of executable
code. Fully automatic PoC included for testing/replicating the issue.
Due to the fact they clearly intended to prevent upload/execution of
executable code, I am of the view it is a vulnerability as opposed to
abuse of functionality.


PoC: https://github.com/XiphosResearch/exploits/tree/master/suiteshell

Best regards,
Darren Martyn
