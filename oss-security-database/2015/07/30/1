Subject: [CVE Request] WP Slimstat < 4.1.6 - Referer Header XSS

Hi,

Wordpress plugin 'Slimstat' versions < 4.1.6 fail to neutralize untrusted
input from both the Referer header and the endpoint used by their Javascript
tracking code to report the referrer, if enabled. Since this output is
displayed by default on the front page of the Wordpress admin panel,
the XSS here leads to very easy administrator account compromise.

Reported privately via vendor and fixed in current release.
