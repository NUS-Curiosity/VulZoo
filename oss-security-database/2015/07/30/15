This seems vaguely related to the problem on many forums, where certain
characters can be used to masquerade as others, such as using the
Russian alphabet "Т", instead of the English "T". They look exactly the
same, but are obviously treated differently.
$ echo 'Т T' | sed -n l
\320\242 T$


From a forum standpoint of what I've mentioned, the only
'exploitability' is through the use of impersonation.
