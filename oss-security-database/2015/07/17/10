You can complain all your want, but it's not going away. It cuts down on
spam and spoofing mails too much. DMARC isn't some rogue thing that just a
few people are doing. It's all been codified as RFC 7489, and lots of mail
providers have implemented it. There are definitely some things that can be
improved about it (the DMARC WG in the IETF is very busy --
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dmarc-interoperability-04 for their
latest work on this), but ignoring DMARC is just putting your head in the
sand. Best to deal with the annoying workarounds for now until the next
evolution can be spec'd out and implemented. Otherwise, you risk losing
important e-mail (like joyful oss-security@ mails ;-]).

DMARC is just one aspect of that.  For example, would you also request

[citation needed], considering I've sent mail over IPv6 and received it
just fine on Gmail (Google Apps, specifically).
https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126?hl=en#authentication even
mentions IPv6 is supported but just has a few extra caveats that must be
followed.
