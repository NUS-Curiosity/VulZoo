The case is somewhat unusual, but we feel that this seems "too
optional" to have a CVE ID.
http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/CompilingSquid doesn't tell the
user that the OpenSSL library (when an old version is used) must be
configured in a certain way to address a Squid vulnerability.
Admittedly, a user might have already -- for an unrelated reason --
configured OpenSSL to disable client-initiated renegotiation, and
might have an expectation that there would be (in effect) propagation
of this choice into a Squid build. We feel that this isn't an obvious
expectation, especially because that type of propagation isn't
automatic: it requires that an OpenSSL-based product have
application-specific code to support the propagation.

There's no CVE ID for now. If there's a future case where either the
official Squid distribution, or a repackager, decides to
unconditionally force "defined(SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS)" to
be true as a vulnerability fix for an OpenSSL 0.9.8l-1.0.2
environment, then a CVE ID should then be available.
