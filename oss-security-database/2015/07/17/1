Vulnerability:
The code in mailcwp-upload.php  doesn't check that a user is authenticated or what type of file is being uploaded any user can upload a shell to the target wordpress server:

  2 $message_id = $_REQUEST["message_id"];
  3 $upload_dir = $_REQUEST["upload_dir"];
.
.
  8 $fileName = $_FILES["file"]["name"];
