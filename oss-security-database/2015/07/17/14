We have a few questions about this.

First, we probably don't understand your build process. The only
mentions of the substring "renegotiate" in squid-3.5.6.tar.bz2 are:

    - TLS: Disable client-initiated renegotiation
  
  #if defined(TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate)
              TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate,
  #endif
  
  #if defined(SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS)
  static void
  ssl_info_cb(const SSL *ssl, int where, int ret)
  [ ... ]
  #endif
  
  configureSslContext
  ...
  #if defined(SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS)
      SSL_CTX_set_info_callback(sslContext, ssl_info_cb);
  #endif
  
  sslCreateClientContext
  ...
  #if defined(SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS)
      SSL_CTX_set_info_callback(sslContext, ssl_info_cb);
  #endif

The only mention of the substring "renegotiate" in squid-3.5.5.tar.bz2
is:

  #if defined(TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate)
              TLSEXT_TYPE_renegotiate,
  #endif

http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/CompilingSquid doesn't seem to
mention the change.

How do these 3.5.6 changes disable anything, or serve as one of two
"fixes for two security issues"? Are you just providing a (not widely
documented) build option so that a repackager or end user could define
SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS if desired?

In that situation, we don't believe there should be a CVE ID for the
official Squid distribution, because the change is about adding
functionality in the form of a new, non-default option. If a
repackager decided to build with SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS and
then announce their 3.5.6 renegotiation change as a required security
update for their customers, then the repackager could have a CVE ID.

Second, we don't know what you mean by "CVE-2009-3555 ... was clearly
assigned for server-initiated renegotiation." This statement is,
however, not critical to CVE assignment, so we won't try to start a
discussion of that. The principal reason that CVE-2009-3555 can't be
correct is that CVE-2009-3555 isn't about resource-consumption DoS.

> CVE-2011-1473 which is for the library itself and disputed

Right, in a case where there should be a CVE ID, we feel that the
vulnerable product would be specific server-side code, not a
general-purpose library.

To conclude, if the position of the Squid developers is that
client-initiated renegotiation must be denied (e.g., because it can
lead to resource-consumption DoS, and there aren't any supported Squid
use cases where you feel it's important to let a client renegotiate),
and you have changed your code to take this position by default, then
you can have a CVE ID. Otherwise, we think not.
