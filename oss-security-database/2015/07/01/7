Subject: CVE Request: two security issues in openSSH 6.9

Hi,

The openSSH 6.9 release contains the following changes declared as
security issues:

http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-6.9

> Security
> --------
>
>  * ssh(1): when forwarding X11 connections with ForwardX11Trusted=no,
>    connections made after ForwardX11Timeout expired could be permitted
>    and no longer subject to XSECURITY restrictions because of an
>    ineffective timeout check in ssh(1) coupled with "fail open"
>    behaviour in the X11 server when clients attempted connections with
>    expired credentials. This problem was reported by Jann Horn.

In the portable releases, this is 
https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?h=V_6_9&id=1bf477d3cdf1a864646d59820878783d42357a1d

>  * ssh-agent(1): fix weakness of agent locking (ssh-add -x) to
>    password guessing by implementing an increasing failure delay,
>    storing a salted hash of the password rather than the password
>    itself and using a timing-safe comparison function for verifying
>    unlock attempts. This problem was reported by Ryan Castellucci.

In the portable releases, this is
https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?h=V_6_9&id=9173d0fbe44de7ebcad8a15618e13a8b8d78902e

Could CVE-IDs be assigned for these please?

Andreas
