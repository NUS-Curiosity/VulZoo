AFAICT, virtually all the open-source and closed-source security
testing tools are dependent on the availability of this information;
this certainly includes Nessus, most web security scanners, most AV
software, etc.

Would you choose not to do this in situations where no public exploit
is available, and therefore you would be unlikely to see the
immediately evident nuisance attacks described in your message?

Starting with the premise that the disclosure of security bugs makes
computer systems more vulnerable to attacks, would it be preferable to
completely discourage sharing vulnerability information with the
general public? If not, why?
