Subject: CVE request: Two ruby 'dl' vulnerabilities fixed in ruby-1.9.1-p129

>From the above:

* DL::Function#call could pass tainted arguments to a C function even if
$SAFE > 0.
https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/7269e3de3cee3bbb6ab77fc708f3a10cab00b65e

* DL::dlopen could open a library with tainted library name even if
$SAFE > 0
https://github.com/ruby/ruby/commit/4600cf725a86ce31266153647ae5aa1197b1215b

Doesn't look like either one of these was ever assigned a CVE (please
correct me if I'm wrong).

These seem to be different issues than CVE-2008-3657.
