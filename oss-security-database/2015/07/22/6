Subject: Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities in SoX 14.4.2

​Hello,

I would like to report publicly new memory corruption vulnerabilities in
the latest SoX, 14.4.2 - these have been reported in April 2015 through
oCERT, but they have notified me they still haven't received a response
from upstream.

Please see this shared folder, visible to anybody with the link:

The write heap buffer overflows are related to ADPCM handling in WAV files,
while the read heap buffer overflow is while opening a .VOC.

For each crash, you have the input file and a .txt with the ASAN output.

Thanks,

CVE-ASSIGN: Please assign CVEs. Thanks.
