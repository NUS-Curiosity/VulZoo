We didn't understand this part. Build 271 is from 2015-06-20. The
vendor made a source-code change related to the bug report today.
There were three builds that occurred after 271, but before today.
We're not sure why "< = Build 271" would be mentioned.

Use CVE-2015-5612 for the issue affecting the caption of a profile
picture. Use CVE-2015-5613 for the other issues fixed in
8a4ac533e5cd6b8f92e9ef19fbfbb2f505dc7a9a. (We haven't yet looked at
whether "caption of a profile picture" is only associated with the
_image_single.htm change.)
