Subject: Security issues in LXC (CVE-2015-1331 and CVE-2015-1334)

Two security issues were found in LXC:

* Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw that allows
  arbitrary file creation as the root user. A local attacker must set up
  a symlink at /run/lock/lxc/var/lib/lxc/<CONTAINER>, prior to an admin
  ever creating an LXC container on the system. If an admin then creates
  a container with a name matching <CONTAINER>, the symlink will be
  followed and LXC will create an empty file at the symlink's target as
  the root user. 
  - CVE-2015-1331
  - Affects LXC 1.0.0 and higher
  - https://launchpad.net/bugs/1470842
  - https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/72cf81f6a3404e35028567db2c99a90406e9c6e6 (master)
  - https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/61ecf69d7834921cc078e14d1b36c459ad8f91c7 (stable-1.1)
  - https://github.com/lxc/lxc/commit/f547349ea7ef3a6eae6965a95cb5986cd921bd99 (stable-1.0)

* Roman Fiedler discovered a flaw that allows processes intended to be
  run inside of confined LXC containers to escape their AppArmor or
  SELinux confinement. A malicious container can create a fake proc
  filesystem, possibly by mounting tmpfs on top of the container's
  /proc, and wait for a lxc-attach to be ran from the host environment.
  lxc-attach incorrectly trusts the container's
  /proc/PID/attr/{current,exec} files to set up the AppArmor profile and
  SELinux domain transitions which may result in no confinement being
  used.
