Subject: CVE Request: freeradius: the EAP-PWD module performs insufficient
 validation on packets received from an EAP peer

The FreeRADIUS project has reported a flaw that affects the EAP-PWD
module of the freeradius package versions 3.0 up to 3.0.8. This module
is not enabled by default, so administrators must have manually enabled
it for their servers to be vulnerable.

Reference:
http://freeradius.org/security.html#eap-pwd-2015

Can a CVE id be please assigned to this flaw?
