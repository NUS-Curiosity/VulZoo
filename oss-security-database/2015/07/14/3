Subject: CVE request: ansible zone/chroot/jail escape

Hi,

I recently found a symlink attack that enables a malicious
zone/chroot/jail managed by ansible to escape into the managing host.
This was fixed in ansible 1.9.2 (commit list below, see
https://github.com/ansible/ansible).

I am not an ansible committer but Toshio requested I follow up. I
understand that a request was made by Toshio to CVE-assign on 1st July
but no response was received. The commits are already public and it has
been announced on ansible's security page:
http://www.ansible.com/security.

Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?


Thanks,

Martin.
