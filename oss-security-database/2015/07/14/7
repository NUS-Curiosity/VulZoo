I just looked at the pull:

Markus Vervier noticed that our client side code isn't being
defensive enough around DHE parameters and can pass on a
"0" as the value of dh->p. Note: not that the the BIGNUM is NULL,
but that the value of the number is a literal zero.

[snip]

Reminder: Client mode is disabled and won't be enabled until X509
validation is ready. But we can still make improvements and fixes
in the meantime.

so I'm not sure this needs a CVE as the code is not yet enabled.
