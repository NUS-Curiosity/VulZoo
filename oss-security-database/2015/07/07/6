Subject: Follow up: PowerDNS Security Advisory 2015-01

Hi all,

We've updated our security advisory regarding CVE-2015-1868[1].
Toshifumi Sakaguchi discovered that our fix for this CVE was
insufficient in some cases with specially crafted packets.

Last month we released patched versions[2] and we've now updated the
Advisory to reflect this. If you have not updated yet, we advice again
to update.
