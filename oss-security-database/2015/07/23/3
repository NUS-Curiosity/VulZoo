I'm not happy about use of external resources like Google Drive or
pastebin for crucial detail.  With Google Drive gone in some years from
now, your message would make little sense.  I understand that the .voc
file was a bit too large for attaching, and I dislike binary attachments
anyway, but at least I've attached the text files with ASAN backtraces,
as text/plain MIME type.  Ideally, you'd have proper analysis and even
smaller testcases rather than just this, but I understand that people's
time is limited.  So whatever we have... but at least we should have it
archived in here.
