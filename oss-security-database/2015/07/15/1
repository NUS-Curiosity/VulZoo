Hi Kurt,

that is a valid point from you and not for me to decide.
Yet with default settings a binary is compiled (bin/s2nc) which will
work in client mode when environment variable S2N_ENABLE_CLIENT_MODE=1
is set (as documented). So it is possible several people were tempted to
use s2n in client mode already as the client mode code is actually
compiled into the lib and useable by default.
I guess it depends on your definition of "enabled".
