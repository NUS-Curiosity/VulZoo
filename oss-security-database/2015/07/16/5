Subject: CVE request: Zenphoto before 1.4.9 multiple vulnerabilities

Can I get CVEs for vulnerabilities fixed in Zenphoto 1.4.9, thanks?

http://www.zenphoto.org/news/zenphoto-1.4.9 says "Fixes several SQL Injection,
XSS and path traversal security issues [trisweb â€“ Thanks to Tim Coen for the
report and help]"
