I think the situation is the same as with other bugs -- it depends on 
the project. I would report them if the application in question is in a 
good shape. Otherwise I would start with crashes.

My experience in fuzzing binutils[1] and elfutils[2] with ubsan was 
quite positive. It was easy to integrate it into my workflow and all 
reported issues were promptly fixed by the maintainers.

[1] reports with ubsan start at

[2] reports with ubsan start at
