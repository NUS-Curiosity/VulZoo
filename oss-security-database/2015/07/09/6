That looks like a stack overflow to me, not a buffer overflow on the stack. (So in
X86 terms, the problem isn't that a pointer to the right of a buffer on a stack is
used, the problem is that the stack pointer was decremented past the *left* end of
the stack. To the left end of the stack of the main thread is a really big area of
unallocated memory, so you get a segfault.)

Are you sure this is a buffer overflow?
