There is another unserialize issue fixed in 5.6.7, 5.5.23 and 5.4.39
and currently listed on PHP 5 Changelog page:

http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php

Fixed bug #68976 (Use After Free Vulnerability in unserialize()). (CVE-2015-0231)
https://bugs.php.net/68976

While this lists CVE, it's CVE that was assigned to an issue fixed in
5.6.5, 5.5.21 and 5.4.37:

Fixed bug #68710 (Use After Free Vulnerability in PHP's unserialize()). (CVE-2015-0231)
https://bugs.php.net/68710

New id seems to be required for the new issue.
