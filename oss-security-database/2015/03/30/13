Subject: CVE-2015-0249: Apache Roller allows admin users to execute
arbitrary Java code
To: "dev@...ler.apache.org" <dev@...ler.apache.org>, user@...ler.apache.org


Severity: Important

Vendor:
   The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
   Roller 5.1.1
   Roller 5.1
   The unsupported pre-Roller 5.1 versions may also be affected

Description:

   A Roller user with Admin-level access to a weblog can edit a weblog
   page template and use special Velocity syntax to execute Java code on
   the server.

Mitigation:

   There are several ways you can fix this vulnerability:

   1) Upgrade to the latest version of Roller, which is now 5.1.2.

   2) Or, add the following line to Roller's velocity.properties file:


runtime.introspector.uberspect=org.apache.velocity.util.introspection.SecureUberspector

   3) Or, disable template editing on your Roller system by un-checking
      the Allow Custom Themes setting in the Server Admin -> Configuration
page,
      Theme Settings section.
