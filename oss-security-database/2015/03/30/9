Are CVE's only assigned if upstream is issuing fixes? The bug
entry reads like that there is something that needs fixing:

Attackers can pose as a legit realm (with the same name) so the admin is tricked to
join to a rogue AD, allowing an attacker to log into the machine.
The admin has no chance to know that he joined an evil AD which
has hijacked his legit realm-name.
Even when its intentional that the join is automatic for convenience,
it should "somehow" be ensured that the legit AD servers are used.
