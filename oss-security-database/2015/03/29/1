For purposes of determining the number of CVE IDs,
https://bugs.debian.org/774015#11 is considered a 2015 vulnerability
announcement, and https://bugs.debian.org/774015#3 is not considered a
vulnerability announcement at all.

(There was another conceivable interpretation in which part of
security-afl.patch fixed an issue discovered by Jakub Wilk in 2014,
and another part of security-afl.patch fixed a second similar issue
discovered by Guillem Jover in 2015, with two CVEs. We aren't doing
that here.)

Use CVE-2015-2782.
