I have no link to MySQL.   You need to take this up with those people.

I would really like to be able to do that, but this is a political
problem outside my control.

We, the linux team, already contribute not inconsiderable amounts to
the community: we're a big contributor to xen, to parts of the linux
kernel including btrfs, ocfs2 (obviously), nfs ... the MAINTAINERS
file lists 13 maintainers with @oracle.com maintainers.   It wouldn't
take a lot of searching to find our contributions to numerous other
projects.

None of this, however, has anything to do with the matter at hand.  If
no one from Red Hat is unwilling to cooperate in getting a single
backward-compatible resolution to incorporating PEP-466 into the
distro python versions then perhaps someone else is.

If there's interest, I'll gladly work with anyone who wants to find a
way to do this.   This is just me trying, as usual, to do the best by
everyone.  I don't speak for Oracle, I'm not paid enough for that, I'm
just trying to make sure that we don't wind up with a backported fix
that makes the overall situation worse.

So can we please set aside the anti-corporate sentiments?
