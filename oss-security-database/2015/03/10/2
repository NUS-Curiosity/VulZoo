I'm happy to help work on this.

The two ways to attack this seem to be:

1) Use alternatives for the ssl module, and a new package has a
higher priority version of the module.

2) Include both versions of the module under different names, and
have a script that symlinks the correct one in place.  This may work
better in chroot environments, etc.
