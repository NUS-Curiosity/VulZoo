Our statements from 2008 (7 years ago) still stand and our package
manager does the full repository signing since 2006 already.

"Endless Data Attack" is open, as it is hard to solve for openSUSE with
its public mirror system.

The expiry was something added a bit later after the paper to address
the downgrade and replay attacks.
