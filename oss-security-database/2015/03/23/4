An attacker only needs control over a few keys in the strong set to add
any number of keys they want, which can then sign other keys. There's
value in the GPG WoT but it's non-trivial to extract it. You could
specifically find Debian devs and obtain their fingerprints securely
from various other places. I think the numbers of users who are going to
do this can probably be counted on a single hand. If there were actually
instructions on this in the installation guide, it could be argued that
a secure option is there.
