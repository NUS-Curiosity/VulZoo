Subject: CVE-2015-1820: ruby rest-client session fixation vulnerability

Following the very similar vulnerability in python-requests
(CVE-2015-2296), the rest-client team discovered a vulnerability which
has now been fixed in rest-client 1.8.0.
https://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client/versions/1.8.0
https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client/issues/369

The problematic behavior was introduced in rest-client 1.6.1: any
Set-Cookie headers present in an HTTP 30x redirection response are
blindly sent to the redirection target, regardless of domain, path,
expiration, or secure cookie settings. All subsequent 1.6.x and 1.7.x
releases are affected.

Similarly to the issue with python-requests, the issue could be
exploited in the following ways:

- If you are the redirection source (i.e. you can make rest-client hit
your URL), you can make rest-client perform a request to any
third-party domain with cookies of your choosing. This may be useful
in performing a session fixation attack.
- If you are the redirection target (i.e. you can make a third-party
site redirect to your URL), you can steal any cookies set by the
third-party redirection.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2015-1820.

Cheers,
Andy
