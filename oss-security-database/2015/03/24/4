Subject: CVE request Qemu: malicious PRDT flow from guest to host

   Hello,

Due to inconsistent error checking, Qemu emulator allows malicious PRDT data 
to flow from a guest to the host's IDE or AHCI controllers. This could result 
in infinite loop or memory leakage on the host leading to unbounded resource 
consumption.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the system,
resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:
