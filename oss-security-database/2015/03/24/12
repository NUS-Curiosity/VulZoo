Subject: Re: CVE request for OpenStack Compute (nova)

I am not a member of OpenStack VMT, so this is just my opinion, but I
think the CVE should probably apply to all versions.

It's worth noting that the C1 rating mentioned in the launchpad bug is
referring to this:
https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vulnerability_Management#Incident_report_taxonomy

Which is "Not considered a practical vulnerability (but some people
might assign a CVE for it)".

So it's not necessarily saying there is no vulnerability/CVE needed for
other versions. Just that it's not considered serious enough for an
OSSA, by my reading.
