Because some Linux OS related companies provide software with API/ABI
compatibility guarantees which results in a very long term back porting
effort especially if the software is supported for 10-13 years. Also
there's a large embedded market for Linux that is also interested in
stability/being boring.

See the funny thing is we're not ignoring them. We're identifying and
backporting the important ones, like security fixes. But as you know
Kernel patch volume is quite high and not all patches are properly
labelled as important or security by upstream, which leads to:

So we can more easily identify the security related vulnerabilities and
patches and provide updates for customers.

This is why it's important to get CVE's onto security issues as soon as
possible. Then we don't have a bunch of random/old issues to deal with
at some point in the future. Aka why I unembargoed all our old cruft and
cleaned house.
