> After years working on Linux, I just found out, that any user not only root can read the kernel log buffer - I never even considered that this could be the case.
> 
> As this behavior is documented and expected, this is not a security vulnerability. But to avoid things like in [1], I would like to disable that on my machines.

> Questions:
> 
> * What would be the side effects of making /dev/kmesg only root accessible? Maybe syslog not able to write kmessages to log?
> 
> * Would it be safe to disable the syslog syscall for action SYSLOG_ACTION_READ_* and all users except root and syslog? Does someone have tested selinux config for that?
