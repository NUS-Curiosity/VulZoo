Subject: RE: CVE request: Linux kernel: tty: kobject
 reference leakage in tty_open

Hi Greg,
To me, it is more of an issue of tracking products which were designed and sold in the vulnerable timeframe, and may still embed these flaws.

Most of the embedded market may not be vulnerable to this attack for other reasons, but a CVE would help to track it for the exceptions.  A GENIVI head unit that uses logins to implement the IVI user concept comes to mind.

Sincerely,

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the virtual console support(CONFIG_VT) is vulnerable
to a NULL pointer dereference issue. It could occur while accessing pseudo
terminal device(/dev/pts/*) files.

An unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system kernel resulting
in DoS.

Upstream fix:
- -------------
   -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/c290f8358acaeffd8e0c551ddcc24d1206143376


Thank you.
