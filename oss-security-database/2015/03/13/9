Sadly, PIE is much less useful on Android right now. Every app and many
services are spawned from an initial zygote process without an exec, so
nearly everything has the same ASLR bases. It is great to see progress
in this space though. I hope to see the zygote process go away now that
ART and modern hardware makes it much less necessary - especially if a
process (or a pool) is pre-spawned during idle time.

AFAIK, the change forbidding non-PIE binaries was backed out for the
official 5.0 release
(https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/d81b3b275dff99561cbe5905ca63a1c72fa54a17).
I guess that was fixed in 5.1? I haven't looked into it yet.

FWIW, I think various distributions are going to enable it once the PIE
by default patches land:

https://www.mail-archive.com/gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org/msg105030.html

There has been no luck getting someone to review them, so they missed
the GCC 5 freeze deadline despite being ready before then.

I proposed that we enable it by default on Arch via wrapper scripts, but
it was rejected in favour of waiting for this patch to land. An OpenSUSE
developer also voiced interest in the patches on the GCC mailing list.
It just needs a committer who feels like reviewing it.
