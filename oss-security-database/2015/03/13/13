You are getting the dates of your patches out of order. There were
three patches submitted in the following order:

2014-05-08: Remove support for non-PIE executables
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/2aebf5429bb1241a3298b5b642d38f73124c2026

2014-06-19: Reenable support for non-PIE executables
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/d81b3b275dff99561cbe5905ca63a1c72fa54a17

2014-07-03: Revert "Reenable support for non-PIE executables"
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/76e289c026f11126fc88841b3019fd5bb419bb67

The last patch is definitely in Android 5.0, and was never backed out.
