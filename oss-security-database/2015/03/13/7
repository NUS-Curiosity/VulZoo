I brought this to Twitter, and here's a comment by Rich Felker:

<solardiz> Android 5.0 "has removed support for non-PIE binaries. Attempting to run a non-PIE binary will generate an error" http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/03/13/1
<@RichFelker> @solardiz Guess that means no emacs on Android...
<@solardiz> @RichFelker Why, can't one build Emacs as PIE?
<@RichFelker> @solardiz The whole dumper issue. The final emacs binary is a dump of an emacs with a lisp heap full of pointers and no relocation data.
