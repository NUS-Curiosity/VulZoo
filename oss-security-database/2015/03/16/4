Subject: CVE Request: memory leak in openssl "hostname" TLS Extension

Hi,

Reported to us by a customer.

The "hostname" TLS extension in openssl had a memory leak, fixed in 2009:

https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7587347bc48e7e8a1e800e48bb0a658f1557c424

    Fix memory leak.

Fixed in 0.9.8g. (did not check 0.9.7, the extension was introduced in the 0.9.7 lifetime somewhen)

1.0.0 and 1.0.1 already contained the fix as they shipped.

Ciao, Marcus
