I am not aware of any current browser which meets any of these criteria,
much less all of them:
  - supports the ancient BDF bitmap font format in its webfonts, instead of
    scalable font formats such as OpenType, TrueType, or Postscript Type 1.
  - uses the old X server-side font technology instead of rendering on
    the client side, where it can do complex text layout & antialiasing
  - downloads a BDF font from a website, stores to a local directory,
    runs mkfontdir in that directory, and adds it to the X font path.

The primary exploit path X.Org is aware of these would be a local user who
can login to an X session already, running "xset +fp" to add a directory
under their control to the font path of that X server in order to execute
code with the privileges of the X server (often root).
