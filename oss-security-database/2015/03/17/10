-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Thanks very much for passing along a link to the affected
drivers/infiniband/core/umem.c source code. This specific CVE wasn't
previously announced on the oss-security list, but your message has
important information about an open-source vulnerability.

> https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-8159

For a CVE assigned by Red Hat, it's their prerogative to make their
initial announcement in a document that doesn't mention the related
source-code change and doesn't state whether the document's
information is applicable to upstream. Linux kernel CVEs published by
MITRE (or NVD) normally don't mention fixed Red Hat package versions,
but we do prefer to include some type of related version information
if the upstream applicability is not (yet) known. This doesn't mean
precisely expressing a single distribution's data when better
information is likely to be released soon. This CVE's version
information will be updated based on your report and other sources. In
this case, 2.6.32-504.12.2 was the only actionable version information
determined directly from Red Hat's document.

The specific source-code change from
https://community.mellanox.com/message/4402#4402 isn't in 3.19.1 or
4.0-rc4.
