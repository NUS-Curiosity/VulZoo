Firstly, a correction to my earlier statement about the fixed release:
1.0.0i is the first release to include the patch.

Yes

I don't believe so. It looks like these are initialized as NULL, and
if they are still NULL at this point in execution then we assume the
input file was malformed and exit with the appropriate return code.

This vulnerability is related to the missing "> 1024 * 1024" test in
the parse_SST function.  The workbook could be crafted with a bad
shared strings table that could use up an excessive amount of memory
resources on the target system. gdb/exploitable.py also indicated
DestAvNearNull at the time of the crash.

The retcode change should benefit #3 and #4, but I don't know that it
has any role at all in preventing the vulnerabilities.
