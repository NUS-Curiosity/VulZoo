On 2015-02-26 I reported to Cygwin that they had a similar man-in-the-middle issue.
The Cygwin package manager (which downloaded all other packages) was unprotected
and downloaded using http (as http://cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe or http://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe).
They changed it to load with HTTPS, and later added HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).

However, since they were the only site that could (realistically) correct it, I didn't
request a CVE.  (FYI, they quickly repaired that problem once they received the report.)

Should I have requested a CVE?
