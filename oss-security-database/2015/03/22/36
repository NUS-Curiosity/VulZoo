The same way as for bootstrapping key validity using OpenPGP , in the
absence of a direct verification path a probabilistic trust model can
be used, mainly. The package being signing using the same key over
time signifies that it is coming from authoritative source (unless
you've been MITMed a long time), the fingerprint of the OpenPGP key
should be included in email announcements and other documents that are
being mirrored by multiple sources, reducing the likelihood of a MITM
if corresponding information is the same in multiple archives over a
long time. Its always better to have a direct validation path to the
key in question, but all is not in vein without it.
