So I guess we enter uncharted territory here. So my thought is this:

Vendor has front page that recommends doing something completely insane
and insecure (http/md5s/etc.). On the back end (good lucking finding
this) vendor does something sort of secure (gpg signing of packages, no
clue if key distribution is secure) but this is not really documented well.

Does this win a CVE or not? I personally think yes, yes it does.

Mitre as always is the final arbiter of what is cool. I mean what is a CVE.
