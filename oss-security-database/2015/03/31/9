Well, it's been an interesting experience to be on the other side of
the information deficit for once.  Usually, it's us who complain about
certain upstreams who say that they have fixed some vulnerabilities in
a new release (along with tons of other fixes), list a few CVEs, but
without any details what was actually fixed.

In any case, my immediate need for this information is gone.  Debian
jessie will not release with the docker.io package.  (Previously, it
was at version 1.3.3, which is why I was a bit concerned.)
