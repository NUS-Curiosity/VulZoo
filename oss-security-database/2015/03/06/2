My 2c ... no it does not.

There are 7 parts in a URL. What is called "netloc" in that description
is actually two fields: [userinfo '@'] authority

The userinfo field is very much alive and well in non-HTTP schemes.


Ignoring the userinfo field leaves implementations open to attacks of
the form:
   scheme://example.com@...shing.com/path
