Subject: CVE request: Maven downloads JARs via HTTP

Hi,

I don't see a CVE assigned for this anywhere:

https://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-5672

"Maven Central can now be accessed via HTTPS. I think the default
configuration should be switched to use that, rather than the current
unsecured HTTP transport."

This was fixed in Maven 3.2.3:

https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.2.3/release-notes.html

Thanks,
