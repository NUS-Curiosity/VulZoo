> Upstream has opened two bugs for issues in realmd

This initial response has a CVE ID only for the second one.

Is upstream planning to announce this as a vulnerability fix? Although
the old behavior was unsafe if there was any possibility of an
untrusted device on the LAN, it appears that the old behavior had been
intentional. For example, the old behavior may have been chosen as a
security/convenience tradeoff. This example might be applicable:

Use CVE-2015-2704.
