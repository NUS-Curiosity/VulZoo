-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

At this point, it seems best to define the affected releases for
CVE-2015-2687 to include Icehouse and Juno, in addition to Havana.
There is at least one person (hfamily15) who believes it is a
vulnerability within all of these releases, and nobody has indicated
that it must not be considered a vulnerability within any of these
releases.

This means that the http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/03/24/10
text starting with "It is conceivable that" is no longer applicable.

The CVE project is not attempting to suggest that the existence of a
CVE ID associated with a supported release means that an OSSA is
required.

Similarly, there's obviously no obligation to send a notification to
oss-security whenever a potential vulnerability has been evaluated.
