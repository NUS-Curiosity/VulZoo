Use CVE-2013-7436. The "If the https is used to transfer the cookie"
text in the commit seems somewhat confusing. As far as we can tell,
the new code does not mean that the server looks for cookie
transmission over https and then decides to use the secure attribute.
Instead, the new code seems to have the "normal" behavior in which the
server sets the secure attribute upon any use of an https session by
the client.

In other words, there isn't an incomplete fix in which the first
cookie transmission over https lacks the secure attribute.
