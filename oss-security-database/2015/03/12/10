Subject: CVE request: lftp saves unknown host's fingerprint in known_hosts
 without any prompt

Hello,

I did not see a CVE request for this yet - so here we go:

While connecting to an unknown host, lftp silently accepts it's
fingerprint and adds it to the known_hosts file.
This makes MitM attack possible.

Upstream report...
https://github.com/lavv17/lftp/issues/116
...and the fix:
https://github.com/lavv17/lftp/commit/bc7b476e782d77839765f56bbdb4cee9f36b54ec

References:
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=774769
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1180209

Can a CVE be assigned to this please?

Thanks.
