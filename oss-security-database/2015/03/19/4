Volume is definitely a problem, and only going to get worse.

Has any consideration been given to maybe going with "Second class"
CVEs? For example in a case where a security issue is obvious (a PHP app
with XSS due to missing htmlspecialchars for example) and well
documented (link to a github commit or similar) could Mitre just assigns
the CVE, link it to the gihub commit or whatever the original source is
and it never give it a "real" description? Most of these types of issues
just need CVEs and an entry in the database with the source, I don't
think anyone cares much beyond that.
