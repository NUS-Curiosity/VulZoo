Subject: CVE request: flexlay: Insecure use of temporary files

Hi,

Flexlay [1], a generic 2D editor, insecurely uses temporary files which
have a fixed name. This affects the current development tree (which is
the most used version of flexlay) as well as older releases. Reported in
flexlay's issue tracker as #65 [2].

A CVE has previously been requested from secalert@...hat.com, however,
they told me I should use this list as the FIXME comment [3] in the
affected code is apparently public enough.
