Subject: mail-client/claws-mail-3.13.1: Stack Overflow - CVE needed?

As per https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=569010

This upstream bug was fixed in
3.13.1:http://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/claws-mail/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3557

The title is "Remotely exploitable bug", but the information is a bit
unclear. It looks like this is a stack overflow. Anyway, probably
means 3.13.1 should receive fast stabilization and a GLSA.

This version also fixes two oob errors I reported, I don't think
they're security risks, but for completeness here they are (some
consider every oob issue to be worthy of treating as a potential
security issue):http://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/claws-mail/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3559http://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/claws-mail/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3563
