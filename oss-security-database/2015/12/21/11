Considering that until recently, Go did not protect against RSA-CRT key
leaks, doesn't that mean that all certificates whose private key was
touched by Go code should be re-issued?

RSA-CRT hardening was added in this commit:

https://github.com/golang/go/commit/40ac3690efe420ff7665c6fe1eec0933c41d1413

To protect against future key leaks due to similar issues in the
implementation integer arithmetic, I strongly recommend backporting this
hardening feature.
