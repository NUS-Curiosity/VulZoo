Hello List,

Those three interlinked issues did not find complete
discussion/solution in the past 3 month after reporting to Linux
distributor, but there is silent approval for disclosure (for
2015-11-30).

Send me a note, if someone else wants to take a look before that,
otherwise I would post the links 2015-12-14.

Kind regards,
hd
