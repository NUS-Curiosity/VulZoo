I have a question about CVE-2015-8384, according to
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1287623 the fixing commit
in upstream VCS is r1558, but (cf.
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1287623#c6) CVE-2015-3210
was assigned for the issue fixed by the same revision r1558.

Should any of those two CVE be rejected?

Regards,
Salvatore
