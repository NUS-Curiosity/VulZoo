Subject: CVE request - Linux kernel - Fix handling of stored error in a
 negatively instantiated user key

Gday,

A bug was found by Dmitry Vyukov (of Google engineering) in the Linux
kernel key management code.

A malicious user with a local account may be able to escalate privileges
and take control of local system by abusing the user key subsystem.

>From the patch: 

--
If a user key gets negatively instantiated, an error code is cached in the
payload area.  A negatively instantiated key may be then be positively
instantiated by updating it with valid data.  However, the ->update key
type method must be aware that the error code may be there.
--

The paging address is predictable and mappable as userspace memory and can
be used by abused by an attacker to escalate privileges.

This is not the same issue as CVE-2015-7872, this issue persists
after the fix is applied.  I have only seen this affected on the 4.4 
release candidates.


Thanks,

Wade Mealing
