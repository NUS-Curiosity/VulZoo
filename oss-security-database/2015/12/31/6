Subject: Re: CVE request: pngcrush-1.3.35 through 1.7.88 segfault when run with "-loco" option

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Can you explain how a privilege boundary is crossed?

Our understanding is that pngcrush is a command-line program, and that
the bug is largely equivalent to a scenario in which the "-loco"
functionality had not been implemented.

We probably would need a threat model in which the victim cannot
recover from the attack by simply avoiding all subsequent use of the
"-loco" option, e.g., a segfault that realistically could lead to code
execution.

We also can't, for example, assign a CVE ID for a threat model in
which an attacker constructs a huge PNG file in the hope that a victim
may decide to try "pngcrush -loco" on it, and the segfault may cause
the creation of a core file that consumes the victim's available disk
space.
