Subject: CVE-2015-8461: A race condition when handling socket errors can lead
 to an assertion failure in resolver.c

CVE:                CVE-2015-8461
Document Version:   2.0
Posting date:       15 December 2015
Program Impacted:   BIND
Versions affected:  9.9.8 -> 9.9.8-P1, 9.9.8-S1 -> 9.9.8-S2, 9.10.3 ->
9.10.3-P1
Severity:           Medium
Exploitable:        Remotely

Description:

   Beginning with the September 2015 maintenance releases 9.9.8 and
   9.10.3, an error was introduced into BIND 9 which can cause a
   server to exit after encountering an INSIST assertion failure
   in resolver.c

Impact:

   An uncommonly occurring condition can cause affected servers to
   exit with an INSIST failure depending on the outcome of a race
   condition in resolver.c  While difficult to exploit reliably, a
   malicious party could, through deliberate behavior, significantly
   increase the probability of encountering the triggering condition,
   resulting in denial-of-service to clients if successful.
