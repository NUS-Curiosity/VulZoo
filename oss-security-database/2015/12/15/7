Subject: CVE Request: Linux Kernel: information leak from getsockname

Hi,

spotted by grsecurity

getsockname() for some socket families did not check the length of the passed sockaddr,
copying out more kernel memory than required, leaking information from the kernel stack,
including kernel addresses. This can be used for KASLR bypass or other information leaks. 

Ciao, Marcus
