Subject: CVE Request: Use after free in PHP Collator::sortWithSortKeys function

Hi,

I reported a use after free in PHP's Intl extension. The vulnerability is
in Collator::sortWithSortKeys function. Only Php 7.0.0 is affected.

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71020

This can potentially be remotely exploitable if the sorting function is
called on a user supplied array.

Not sure If this is CVE worthy. But if so, please assign it one.

Thanks.
