Subject: Being vulnerable to POODLE

Hi,
If you have a piece of software which is vulnerable to POODLE, should a
CVE be requested for it or should CVE-2014-3566 just be referenced in
any advisories published?

It turns out that CoovaChilli[1] is vulnerable to POODLE & I'd like to
follow the correct procedure regarding disclosure. There's a fix pending
due to needing further testing at which point an advisory will be
published with the necessary details.

Regards,


Sevan
