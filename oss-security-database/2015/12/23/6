Subject: Use after free in nghttp2

https://nghttp2.org/blog/2015/12/23/nghttp2-v1-6-0/

Quote from release announcement:
"This release fixes heap-use-after-free bug in idle stream handling
code. We strongly recommend to upgrade the older installation to this
latest version as soon as possible."

Given nghttp2 is used for many (most?) http2 deployments and these
become more and more common I think this is rather serious.
