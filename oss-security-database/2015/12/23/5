Subject: CVE request -- linux kernel: overlay: fix permission checking for
 setattr

Hello,
If possible, we would like to obtain a CVE-ID for the following security issue.
I was not able to find an already-assigned CVE-ID for this.

A flaw was found in the overlay filesystem of the Linux kernel which allows
an unprivileged user to change attributes of the files in the overlay,
particularly allowing access to root-only-accessible files like '/etc/shadow'.

- an upstream Linux kernel commit fixing the issue.
