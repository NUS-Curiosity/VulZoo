Subject: CVE Request: Plone CSRF

Hi,

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue, please?

   https://plone.org/security/20151006/multiple-csrf-vulnerabilities-in-zope

Plone is built on the Zope2 application framework. In the Zope2 application
framework, there are multiple CSRF vulnerabilities. The latest version of
Plone has automatic CSRF protection integrated at the database layer. This
patch basically backports the latest automatically CSRF infrastructure to
Plone 4.x.

The relevant code is in:

https://github.com/plone/plone.protect
and
https://github.com/plone/plone4.csrffixes
finally, more information about the problem:
https://plone.org/products/plone/security/advisories/security-vulnerability-20151006-csrf


The vendor credits with the discovery: John Page ( hyp3rlinx )

Thanks, let me know if you'd like more information.


Thanks,
Nathan
