We have one person who discovered and submitted a vulnerability. On further
investigation by the security team, more vulnerabilities were found.

There are no CVEs. The backport is of the technology to protect all
functionality, along with addons of the CMS.

Zope2 development is dead. They do not have the people to address the
problem and aren't very interested in it(we've tried coordinating). It is a
Zope2 issue vulnerability. Plone will likely be forking...

There are no other previously known unpatched CSRF vulnerabilities this is
backporting. After testing, we knew that our automatic CSRF protection also
addressed the reported CSRF issue.

security-vulnerability-20151006-csrf is the first public announcement that
Zope2 is mostly unprotected. Zope2 has a collection of management
interfaces, many of which are vulnerable.
