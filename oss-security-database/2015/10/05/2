Fixed downstream in Gentoo with mail-mta/opensmtpd-5.7.2_p1-r1:

https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=3f8e2fe24f3ff174d8515b82607e951e054f68f6

Users are encouraged to update immediately. It's worth noting that
this vulnerability was being triggered "in the wild" - hence the
rushed disclosure etc.

Regards,
Jason
