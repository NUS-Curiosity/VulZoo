Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Nova

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Nova network security group changes are not applied to running
       instances
Reporter: Sreekumar S and Suntao
Products: Nova
Affects: <=2014.2.3, >=2015.1.0, <=2015.1.1

Description:
Sreekumar S and Suntao independently reported a vulnerability in Nova
network. Security group changes silently fail to be applied to already
running instances, potentially resulting in instances not being
protected by the security group. All Nova network setups are affected.
