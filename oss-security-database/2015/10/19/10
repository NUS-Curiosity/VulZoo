Actually, we might have this now.  See:
  http://www.cryptol.net/

These guys put on a very short training at BSidesPDX this last weekend
and it seems like it could be exactly what you're looking for.  No,
not to solve all the DH trouble, but it can make sure an
implementation matches a specification.  Of course you have to have a
specification.  But once you do, it can verify binaries' behavior.
