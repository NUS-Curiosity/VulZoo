Interestingly I noticed OpenSSH bumped their 'DH_GRP_MIN' to 2048 bit
just a few days ago to account for precomputation attacks:

http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/dh.h.diff?
r1=1.13&r2=1.14

RFC4419 seems to recommend 1024 bit minimum, but the document appears
to be from 2006.
