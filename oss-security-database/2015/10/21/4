Subject: CVE Request: BusyBox tar directory traversal

Hello - The BusyBox implementation of tar will extract a symlink that
points outside of the current working directory and then follow that
symlink when extracting other files. This allows for a directory
traversal attack when extracting untrusted tarballs.

This behavior was documented in the BusyBox source with the following
2011 commit:

  http://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=a116552869db5e7793ae10968eb3c962c69b3d8c

I've created an upstream bug report:

  https://bugs.busybox.net/8411

Can we get a CVE assigned to track this? Thanks!

Tyler
