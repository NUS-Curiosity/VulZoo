Elemental-IRCd Security Release: 2015-10-07

CVE-2015-5290

Elemental-IRCd reference code: e50b0d59-f3c5-4472-a3cd-e2e07731417c

## Summary

Elemental-IRCd is an Internet Relay Chat (IRC / RFC 1459) daemon intended
for stable, secure deployments for both private and public-facing users. It
provides quick messaging across servers, even when deployed on a global
scale. One of the recent goals of the project has been to limit memory
leaks and test functionality to ensure quality for all users.

While looking for resource leaks and other things to test inside
Elemental-IRCd git master, we stumbled on an unfortunate programming error
in how the MONITOR command was handled that can lead to a system
out-of-memory event if an attacker hammers at the MONITOR command over and
over.

## Affected Daemons

In our testing, the following IRC daemons were affected:

ircd-ratbox 3.0.8, SVN trunk and older
charybdis 3.5-dev and older
ircd-seven 1.1.3 and older
Elemental-IRCd 6.6.2 and older
Other derivatives of these daemons will be affected as well unless for some
reason they came across and fixed that issue before this release.

## Vulnerability Information

Public release date: 2015-10-07
CVE: CVE-2015-5290
CVSS v3:
CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:W/RC:C/CR:H/IR:L/AR:H/MAV:N/MAC:L/MPR:N/MUI:N/MC:L/MI:N/MA:H
CVSS score: 8.8 / 8.6 / 9.5
Attack complexity: Trivial (less than 30 lines of code)

## Notes

If applying these patches is somehow impossible, the attack can be
completely mitigated by unloading the m_monitor.so module using the
following command provided you have permission to load and unload modules:

    /MODUNLOAD m_monitor.so

The required privilege to do this is defined as the admin flag inside the
flags section of the relevant operator{} block in the configuration
(OLD:O:Line).

This patch can be applied at runtime and will automatically garbage-collect
any memory that has been leaked in the past.

A full set of technical details will be released as soon as it is confirmed
that major IRC networks affected by this have been patched.
