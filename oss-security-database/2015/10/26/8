A fix has been applied to Tails git:
https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/repository/revisions/b9fd6312435d55dd0bc0b6abdb7994da4d66e2b2

In short, the wget binary is moved to /usr/lib/wget/wget, and a
wrapper script is put in place in /usr/bin/wget. The wrapper ensures
that wget is called via torsocks, and additionally, also forces
--passive-ftp.

Moving wget to /usr/lib/wget/wget gets the potentially dangerous wget
binary out of $PATH. A dedicated attacker could check if /usr/bin/wget
is a script and then parse it to find the actual binary, but that
would need to be a very dedicated attacker and at that point, there
are more feasible attacks available.
