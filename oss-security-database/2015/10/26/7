Subject: CVE Request: Wordpress: Cross-site scripting vulnerability in the
 user list table

Hi

Wordpress release 4.3.1 Security and Maintenance Release contained as
well a fix for a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the user list
table:

https://wordpress.org/news/2015/09/wordpress-4-3-1/

Upstream commit:
https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/f91a5fd10ea7245e5b41e288624819a37adf290a

Has a CVE for this already been requested as well? If not can you
assign a CVE?

Regards,
Salvatore
