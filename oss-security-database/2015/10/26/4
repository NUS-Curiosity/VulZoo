Subject: CVE request - open-vm-tools using predictable filename in /tmp

Hi,

It seems that vm-support, from open-vm-tools use /tmp to
store output of diagnostic software.

See 
https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/blob/master/open-vm-tools/scripts/common/vm-support#L200

Can a CVE be assigned ?
