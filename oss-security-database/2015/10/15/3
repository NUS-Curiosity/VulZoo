Subject: CVE Request: Linux Kernel heap corruption on debug_read_tlb

Hello,

Is there a CVE for this? If not, could one be assigned, please?

     https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/6853351/
     commit e203db293863fa15b4b1917d4398fb5bd63c4e88
     iommu/omap: Fix debug_read_tlb() to use seq_printf()

     The debug_read_tlb() uses the sprintf() functions directly on the
buffer
     allocated by buf = kmalloc(count), without taking into account the size
     of the buffer, with the consequence corrupting the heap, depending on
     the count requested by the user.

     The patch fixes the issue replacing sprintf() by seq_printf().
