ok, that's a relief :) but, running the numbers, even 100 hundred
2048-bit groups comes out to a quarter MiB of RAM.  (i figure 256 bytes
per prime, a well-known, shared generator)

Larger groups (or more groups) inflate the size even further.  I know
RAM is cheap these days but for embedded devices a quarter meg or more
of RAM is still not insignificant.

yep, agreed.
