Subject: CVE request: Heap overflow and DoS with a tga file in gdk-pixbuf < 2.32.1

Hello,

We found a heap overflow and a DoS in the gdk-pixbuf implementation
triggered by the scaling of tga file. These issues are only fixed in the
recent release of gdk-pixbuf 2.32.1 but affects older versions (we tested
it in a fully updated Ubuntu 14.04).

These issues were found using QuickFuzz.

Regards,
Gustavo.
