Subject: CVE Request: Information disclosure in pcre

Hi All,

It was reported that pcre_exec in PHP pcre extenstion partially
initialize a buffer when an invalid regex is processed, which can lead
to an arbitrary code execution.

https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1537

This patch has been committed upstream via:
http://vcs.pcre.org/pcre/code/trunk/pcre_exec.c?r1=1502&r2=1510

And is a part of upstream release pcre-8.37

This was initially reported by ZDI (ZDI-CAN-2547), but it seems there
was no follow-up.

Can a CVE id be please assigned to this issue?
