As far as we can tell, the message was written this way because you
are addressing multiple audiences: one audience is interested in what
aspects of the commits are security-related so that they can be mapped
to individual CVE IDs, and another audience is much less concerned
about these mapping details but wants to fix the security problem
without adding a new problem in its place. Specifically, our
understanding is that there is no expectation that anyone has a
production copy of the code with
46844402bca7a38fc224483ba6f0a93c4613203f but not
a632841f8e65d402e13e81921515f5a1e2736c82. If anyone had such a copy,
they possibly might find that an attacker could cause a performance
degradation via a crafted client that intentionally triggers the
"select() call repeated in a loop if the timeout expired without
incoming data" issue. In other words, there is no CVE ID for a
"repeated in a loop" problem, and probably for two reasons: nobody is
using that code, and the performance degradation is too small.

The only CVE ID is for the presence of "addr.sin6_addr = in6addr_any"
in the original code. Use CVE-2015-6520.
