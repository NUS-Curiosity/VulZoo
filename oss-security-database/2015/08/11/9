Subject: CVE request - OpenSSH 6.9 PAM privilege separation vulnerabilities

Hello list,

could you please assign two CVE IDs for the following two security
issues fixed in OpenSSH 7.0 (directly taken from the release notes [1]):

 * sshd(8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a privilege separation
   weakness related to PAM support. Attackers who could successfully
   compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
   execution and who had valid credentials on the host could
   impersonate other users.  Reported by Moritz Jodeit.

 * sshd(8): Portable OpenSSH only: Fixed a use-after-free bug
   related to PAM support that was reachable by attackers who could
   compromise the pre-authentication process for remote code
   execution. Also reported by Moritz Jodeit.

Thank you,
