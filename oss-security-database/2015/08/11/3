Subject: Re: CVE for crypto_get_random() from libsrtp

Hello,

The weakest method it provides uses no encryption at all, just HMAC-SHA1 
with 80 bit authentication tag:
http://srtp.sourcearchive.com/documentation/1.4.2.dfsg/group__SRTP_g94d0056e812802ac2920aa474bc5b59b.html

Unless CVE is assigned, we don't plan to ship any patch at the moment.

Regards,
