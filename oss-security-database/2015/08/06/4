Martin,

We agree that that issue should be included in a 1.4.3 release under a 4th
CVE ID. In addition, we would also like to include:

https://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/12865/

Which addresses the very closely related issue:

https://golang.org/issue/11930

...under the same (4th, not yet assigned) CVE ID.
