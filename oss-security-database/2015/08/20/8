POC for oCERT#2015-009 VLC arbitrary pointer dereference

Running VLC v2.2.1 with sample_crash causes a segmentation fault on 0xccddeeff, an address read in from 0x1b6e6 in the sample_crash file. After this address is freed, vlc then attempts to free the next four bytes in the file, 0x1122331e. 

This data can be changed in the sample_crash file to free two arbitrary addresses. 

sample_crash : http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=94915905821495818830 <http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=94915905821495818830>
