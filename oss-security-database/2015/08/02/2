Subject: CVE request: Multiple spree ruby gems vulnerabilities (across
 multiple versions)

Spree is a complete open source e-commerce solution for Ruby on Rails
* https://spreecommerce.com/
* https://github.com/spree/spree/
* https://rubygems.org/gems/spree (and related gems)

Was going through Spree's releases, and I came across several security
issues that lack CVEs (though some have OSVDB IDs).

* Fixed by

Rendering of arbitrary RABL templates allows for execution arbitrary files
on the host system, as well as disclosing the existence of files on the
system
* Reported via https://spreecommerce.com/blog/security-updates-2015-7-20
* Fixed by

Rendering of arbitrary RABL templates allows for execution arbitrary files
on the host system, as well as disclosing the existence of files on the
system
* Reported via https://spreecommerce.com/blog/security-updates-2015-7-28
* Fixed by
https://github.com/spree/spree/commit/3a5d387d54ad87fea15d3e05018445bf8a24a419
* Fix released in 2.2.13, 2.3.12, 2.4.9, 3.0.3

Separate from the above, there was an additional security issue fixed as of
0.50.0, though the issue didn't affect Spree code directly (but could be
used to compromise a Spree instance):

Spree api/orders.json Search Function Arbitrary Command Execution
* Tracked as http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/71900
* Exploited via
http://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/multi/http/spree_searchlogic_exec
* Reported via https://spreecommerce.com/blog/security-fixes
* Fixed by replacing https://github.com/binarylogic/searchlogic (and the
https://github.com/railsdog/searchlogic fork) with
https://github.com/ernie/meta_search
* Fixed in 0.50.0
* Really this issue affects searchlogic and rd_searchlogic gems, not spree
code itself. I tried to find where in searchlogic this issue was fixed
since the project has had releases since this issue was found, but not
having much luck.

Can CVEs be assigned for these issues?

Thanks,
