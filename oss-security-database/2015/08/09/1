Subject: CVE request - simple-php-captcha - captcha bypass vulnerability

Hi,

We found a captcha bypass vulnerability in an open source captcha 
software, made by Cory LaViska for A Beautiful Site. Here is the github 
repository: https://github.com/claviska/simple-php-captcha.

We opened an issue on github 
<https://github.com/claviska/simple-php-captcha/issues/16>, and the 
vulnerability has been fixed. They never did any release so we don't 
think the fix will be released in any form. Simply advising users to 
update to git master's should suffice.

The simple-php-captcha.php file had a vulnerability enabling a client to 
generate the captcha response automatically, effectively bypassing the 
captcha.

Since the microtime() function was used both in the initial seed for the 
captcha and in the captcha url path sent to the client, it was possible 
to generate the captcha result automatically by running the same code 
client-side.

Could a CVE be assigned to this?

Thank you,
François
