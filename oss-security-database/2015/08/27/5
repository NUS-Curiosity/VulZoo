Subject: CVE-2014-8177 gluster-swift metadata constraints are not correctly
 enforced

Hi,

A flaw was found in the metadata constraints in gluster-swift package. By
adding metadata in several separate calls, a malicious user could bypass the
max_meta_count constraint, and store more metadata than allowed by the
configuration.

Upstream Fix: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/215487

Please refer to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1257525

we are using  CVE-2014-8177,  CVE SPLIT due to different codebases. 
so Please use CVE-2014-8177 for gluster-swift and for openstack-swift 
CVE-2014-7960 was already assigned.
