Subject: CVE Request: twig remote code execution

Hello,

the symphony project released a security advisory for the Twig PHP library:
http://symfony.com/blog/security-release-twig-1-20-0

The linked GitHub pull requests provides the fixes:
https://github.com/twigphp/Twig/pull/1759

AFAICT there are least two issues: a remote code execution fixed by the "fixed
sandbox security issue" patch, and at least another issue regarding access to
"reserved macro names".

The RCE deserves a CVE IMO, but I'm not sure about the other one (or if it is
indeed only one issue).

Can CVE(s) be assigned for the above issue(s) as you deem appropriate?

Thanks
