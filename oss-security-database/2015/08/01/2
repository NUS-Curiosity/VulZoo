Sidekiq is "Simple, efficient background processing for Ruby" (a gem)
* http://sidekiq.org

Was going through Sidekiq's changelog and its commits, and I came across
several security issues that lack CVEs.

XSS via queue name in Sidekiq::Web
* Reported via https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/issues/2330
* Fixed by
https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/2178d66b6686fbf4430223c34c184a64c9906828
* Fix released in sidekiq 3.4.0

XSS via job arguments display class in Sidekiq::Web
* Reported via https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/pull/2309
* Fixed by

* Fix released in sidekiq 3.4.0

Sidekiq::Web lacks CSRF protection
* Reported via https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/pull/2422
* Fixed by
https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/cf3c43b2410c4573e05ac119494e41115f4140ad
* Fix released in sidekiq 3.4.2
* Follow-up fix in
https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/commit/75a3524c919857aac16e0541b0cb107f48d00694
to enable sessions in Sinatra, plus mention of a possible monkey patch
needed to make Rails work correctly (neither change is in a release yet).

Can CVEs be assigned for these issues?

Thanks,
