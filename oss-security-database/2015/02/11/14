I have tested this bug against the Email App in a Samsung Galaxy S4
(4.2.2.0200 vulnerable) and S5 mini (4.2.2.0400 not vulnerable) but I
didn't find these versions numbers in the Email git repository.

That patch fixes a problem with matches with the vulnerability that I
reported but only with that I can not say that that patch fixes what I
have reported.
