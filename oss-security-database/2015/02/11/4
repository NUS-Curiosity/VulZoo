Changing environment variables is not compliant with the prevalent
interpretation of of POSIX, and as a result, at least glibc will not
change its behavior.  This means that AT_SECURE programs such as sudo
need to implement proper filtering.

I will obtain clarification from the Austin Group that scrubbing
environment variables in the implementation name space is allowed, and
then we can revisit this matter as far as glibc is concerned.
