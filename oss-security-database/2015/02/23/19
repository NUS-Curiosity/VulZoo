Subject: Re: [videolan] older issues in libbluray

So the good news/bad news is I'm finished cleaning out about 20 older
bugs that were embargoed and not properly handled (mostly due to them
stalling and then being forgotten I guess, some were from 6 years ago,
well before I even worked for Red Hat).

Again my apologies for this mess. The good news is that all our current
embargoed flaws (none against VLC currently =) are being actively
handled (e.g. worked on in a current time frame) and moving forwards we
should hopefully be able to avoid issues like this.

Also one request (not just specific to VLC, but everyone with a
project): please have a security@ email address for your project or a
security web page that makes it obvious how to contact and report things
privately, this is a common problem and easily solved (and will make it
much easier for people to report issues).

I just recently found myself emailing random security@ addresses at
other projects to see if they bounce or not. I still have no idea if the
projects received my security report (no bounce so here's hoping!).
