Subject: CVE request: two OpenLDAP DoS issues

Hi,

OpenLDAP slapd has two bugs that allow a remote unauthenticated client 
to crash the LDAP server.

The deref overlay in slapd 2.4.13 through 2.4.40 dereferences a NULL 
pointer when a search request includes the Deref control with an empty 
list of attributes to return (missing input validation).

Fix:
http://www.openldap.org/devel/gitweb.cgi?p=openldap.git;a=commitdiff;h=c32e74763f77675b9e144126e375977ed6dc562c

Certain search queries including the Matched Values control can trigger 
a double free in slapd 2.4.40 when freeing operation controls. This is a 
regression in 2.4.40, no earlier releases are affected.

Fix:

May we have CVEs assigned to these, please?

thanks,
Ryan
