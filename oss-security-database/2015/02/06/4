Subject: CVE request for denial-of-service vulnerability in fcgi

Hi,

there appears to be at least a denial-of-service vulnerability in fcgi:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1189958

Can someone pleas assign a CVE id to this, to make sure that other
distributions notice this problem as well.

Unfortunately it looks like fastcgi upstream now died, as their mailing
list is not reachable anymore:
http://mailman.fastcgi.com/mailman/listinfo/fastcgi-developers

So if someone knows how to contact them, please forward them this
information.

Regards
Till Maas
