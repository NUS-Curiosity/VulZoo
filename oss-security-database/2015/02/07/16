Subject: Re: Mozilla: Use-after-free when doing multiple
 nesting using bad tags

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=679572#c2 states "The
addresses look like it's hit our \"frame-poisoning\" mitigation which would
make that an unmapped and unexploitable address but that's off the top of
my head and needs investigation.", so if true, it's only a DoS, which
Mozilla doesn't assign CVEs for since it's not exploitable.

Check
http://robert.ocallahan.org/2010/10/mitigating-dangling-pointer-bugs-using_15.html
for more information about frame poisoning and how it works to make what
used to be always critical security bugs into just crash bugs.

Also, Mozilla is a CNA, so requests for CVEs for Mozilla products should be
directed to them. I've cc'd security@ and Dan Veditz to confirm the above,
however.
