Subject: CVE-2015-0881

I'm trying to track down information on CVE-2015-0881.

I can't find a squid security contact (security@...id-cache.org
bounced), there's no security report, and no link to a source code patch
for this.

This is regarding 3.1.9 and earlier, 3.1.10 was released on 22 Dec 2010,
so 4+ years ago.

Needless to say I am more than a bit confused. A link to a specific code
patch/vuln/file would be helpful. Also if anyone knows how to contact
Squid re security issues properly I'd love to know.
