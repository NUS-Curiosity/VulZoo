We don't build/test setuid binaries, so if you only enforced the
restriction for setuid binaries, then we wouldn't have any problem.

Yes, that form would work for us.

You could also reject relative RPATH for all binaries, unless a
specific LD_ALLOW_RELATIVE_RPATH or some such environment variable is
set.

We could then set that environment variable in the test execution
environment, but not outside of it.

I guess my point is that we must have the ability to use relative
RPATH in testing, so either we'll have to revert your patch, or make
an escape hatch of some sort.
