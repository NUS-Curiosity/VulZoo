FWIW, relative RPATHs are quite fundamental to our test execution
environment, and any patch that unconditionally ignores them would
have to be reverted in our tree.

Also, don't you want to discuss this on libc-alpha? oss-security could
be all for it, but without buy-in from libc-alpha your patch is
unlikely to be going anywhere.
