That's useful to know. Is that for setuid binaries or more generally? As I 
noted, it would be dead easy only to use the part of the patch that rejects 
them for the former only. Although as I said, that offers less protection. 
Would that make the patch more consumable? Another option would be to have 
something like /etc/suid-debug which could flag that an override is in 
operation.

I'm intending to, but getting security folk, who may well wear slightly more 
positive hats to begin with, to review it, seemed like a safe place to start. 
I can well imagine pursuading the glibc folk will be more difficult :/.
