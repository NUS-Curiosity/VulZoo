Title: Glance import task leaks image in backend
Reporter: Abhishek Kekane (NTT)
Products: Glance
Affects: 2014.2 versions through 2014.2.2

Description:
Abhishek Kekane from NTT reported a vulnerability in the Glance import task.
By creating numerous images using the task API and deleting them, an
authenticated attacker may accumulate untracked image data in the backend
resulting in potential resource exhaustion and denial of service. All glance
setups using API v2 are affected.
