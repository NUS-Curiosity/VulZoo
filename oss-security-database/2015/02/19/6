> Title: Glance import task leaks image in backend

Is this about two separate findings, one in 2014 and one in 2015, that
were ultimately fixed at the same time in Glance:

  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/122427/
  Sep 18, 2014 ... an exception is raised and is not handled ...
  the uploaded image file stays in a storage and clogs it

  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/156553
  Feb 17, 2015 ... Import task does not update the location
  of the image ... Image data remains in backend for
  deleted image

? If so, then it should have two CVE IDs.
