Subject: CVE request: vulnerabilities in libcsoap

Hi,

A number of vulnerabilities exist in nanohttp, a lightweight webserver library
included with libcsoap (http://csoap.sourceforge.net). Patches are
provided below against
1.1.0-17.2.

* Remote buffer overflow
If the server is misconfigured, a remote user can trigger a buffer
overflow by requesting a resource of a certain length.

* Remote null pointer dereference
A remote user can cause a null pointer dereference by sending a
malformed Authorization: header.

Please let me know if you req

Cheers,

Patrick
