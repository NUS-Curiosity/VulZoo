Use CVE-2015-1559 for all of the CSRF vulnerabilities.

This token-creation approach is arguably an undesirable behavior, but
it does not have a CVE ID. The existence of the
eb514ea3c45d74a1218e207fb4b345b1 value does not provide access unless
an autologin=1 request is sent within an administrative session. This
issue is relevant mainly when a CSRF vulnerability exists.
http://forum.efrontlearning.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=1940 says:

  Admin->Maintenance->Autologin. This new tab allows to select the
  users that may autologin to the system via a simple link. Useful for
  guest users but there are many others uses as well.

We do not think that intentionally setting up Autologin for an
administrator is a common or plausible use case. If Autologin had been
enabled for any other user account, the attacker would apparently need
to know both the username and the account's creation date. Better
salting would be an opportunity for security improvement. Accounts
that would realistically be configured for Autologin are probably not
high-value accounts, and the salt choice could be a
security-versus-complexity tradeoff.
