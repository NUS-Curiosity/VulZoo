Subject: CVE Request: jabberd remote information disclosure

Hello,

A buffer overflow was found in the XMPP server jabberd2 when normalizing
strings that can lead to remote information disclosure [1]. When parsing a
JID, jabberd2 version 2.3.2 and below truncate the data but do not verify
whether the result is valid UTF8 before passing it to libidn. If the data ends
with an unterminated multi-byte UTF8 sequence then libidn may copy data past
the buffer into the result. This can be exploited by remote clients or remote
servers.

Could you please assign a CVE for this issue?

Best regards,
Thijs Alkemade
