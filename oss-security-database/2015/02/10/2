Subject: Current outstanding CVE requests

Myself, several coworkers and other people have outstanding CVE requests
(I've put them in a spreadsheet so I can clean out my inbox
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L3ltTkrrIn_wrDOXZx7OXrwVeglk2qeN17DW6c9kz1U/edit#gid=0
- please note this list is not complete, email me to get access so you
can edit it). I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to back fill or
otherwise help with the load for CVE assignments on Open Source
software. Thanks.
