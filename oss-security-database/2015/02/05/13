Our initial thought is that the 001649.html disclosure occurred first,
and has a single root cause that also applies to id=409. So, we don't
think that id=409 can have its own separate CVE ID, even though the
id=409 report contained additional detail.

Use CVE-2014-9653 for the entire "readelf.c uses pread() ... it's
happy with partial reads and valgrind show various errors" report
fixed by "file has been changed to bail out when pread() returns
partial buffers."
