Please note they released 3.0.4 to mitigate the problem in case someone updates,
but does not remove malicious code. This is unusual from WordPress plugin
authors. I am very happy to see improvement.

3.0.4
    Renamed the setting affected by the security issue mentioned in 3.0.3. This
    should stop the malicious code from appearing on sites where the plugin is
    updated without removing the malicious code.
