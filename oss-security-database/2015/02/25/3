            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2015-1563 / XSA-118
                              version 2

    arm: vgic: incorrect rate limiting of guest triggered logging

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

On ARM systems the code which deals with virtualising the GIC
distributor would, under various circumstances, log messages on a
guest accessible code path without appropriate rate limiting.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest could cause repeated logging to the hypervisor
console, leading to a Denial of Service attack.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.4 and later systems running on ARM hardware are vulnerable.

x86 systems are not affected.

MITIGATION
==========

The problematic log messages are issued with priority Warning.

Therefore they can be rate limited by adding "loglvl=error/warning" to the
hypervisor command line or suppressed entirely by adding "loglvl=error".

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

This bug was publicly reported on xen-devel, before it was appreciated
that there was a security problem.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Julien Grall.

RESOLUTION
==========
