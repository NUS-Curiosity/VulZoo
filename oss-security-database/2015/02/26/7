Subject: XSS In Zope

So originally Radek Steoger of Red Hat found an XSS in luci/conga:

==========
Within luci's use of Products.PluggableAuthService there appears to be
an XSS, e.g.:

https://luci.example.com:8084/acl_users/users/manage_updatePasswordForm?manage_tabs_message=%3Cscript%3Ealert('1234')%3C/script%3E
==========

this was tracked down to being in Products.PluggableAuthService (a
component of Zope).

I notified the Zope security people, they tracked it down on their end,
this was actually found/fixed in 2009:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/490514

https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/commit/2abdf14620f146857dc8e3ffd2b6a754884c331d

and the fix was forward ported from the 2.10 branch, as well as to the
2.11 branch and the trunk. The fix landed in:
  Zope 2.10.10
  Zope 2.11.5
  Zope 2.12.2

With thanks to Tres, Matt and Nathan for sorting this out/chasing it
down on Zope's end (basically they did all the heavy lifting).

So this should probably get a CVE from 2009.
