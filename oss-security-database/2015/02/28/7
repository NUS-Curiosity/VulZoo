I'm wondering what the actual impact of this issue is supposed to be.
Why would any of the uids inside the container have write access to a
shared filesystem on which their uids are presumably not even
meaningful? It seems to me like this would only affect world-writable
files/directories on the shared filesystem, which sound like a bad
idea to begin with.
