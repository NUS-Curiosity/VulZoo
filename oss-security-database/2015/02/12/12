Use CVE-2014-9679 for this integer overflow that was fixed in 2.0.2.

The scope of this CVE does not include the "nothing that guarantees
that r->bpp is non-zero" observation the "Feb 1, 2015" comment.

This isn't directly relevant to whether a CVE should exist, but
http://cups.org/documentation.php/doc-2.0/man-cups-files.conf.html
mentions 'Specifies the level of security sandboxing that is applied
to print filters, backends, and other child processes of the
scheduler. The default is "strict". This directive is currently only
used/supported on OS X.' Apparently some online discussions of CUPS
include third-party recommendations to disable sandboxing.
