Subject: Re: CVE request: sudo TZ issue

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Your February 9 message said "CVE request," your February 11 message
didn't withdraw the request, and you mentioned that 'the promise that
commands be started with a "safe" environment' is an intended property
of sudo. That's sufficient for a CVE; use CVE-2014-9680.

The scope of CVE-2014-9680 is limited to the undesired ability of an
attacker to trigger an open call for a pathname outside the zoneinfo
directory (whether this is done with an absolute pathname or a
relative pathname). The scope of CVE-2014-9680 does not include
blocking other types of invalid or potentially malicious TZ values.
For example:

> It is longer than the value of PATH_MAX.

It seems simple to envision a program for which a length of PATH_MAX-2
triggers a buffer overflow. Even if such a program were known, we
wouldn't want to assign a CVE ID to sudo on the basis that PATH_MAX-2
isn't blocked.

> Procmail is another program that recklessly whitelists TZ

Use CVE-2014-9681 for the similar issue in procmail.
