There are two distinct buffer overflows:

* Off-by-one heap overflow when parsing addresses that have left angle 
bracket, then a comma, but no right angle bracket. For example: 
<moo@...mple.com,

* Heap overflow when parsing addresses that end with backslash. For 
example: <moo@...mple.com\

Credit goes to Jan Darmochwal for identifying the root causes.
