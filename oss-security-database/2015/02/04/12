Subject: CVE Request: PHP/file: out-of-bounds memory access in softmagic

Hi,
please assign a CVE ID for this issue in file (and in the respective
PHP extension):

Originally reported in file:
Bug report: http://bugs.gw.com/view.php?id=398
Fix: https://github.com/file/file/commit/59e63838913eee47f5c120a6c53d4565af638158

A slightly modified version is also present in PHP (it should receive
the same CVE ID):

We've already fixed these in Debian updates (but CVE IDs haven't been available
back then):
