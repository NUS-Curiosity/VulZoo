        Assign a CVE Identifier <cve-assign@...re.org>
Subject: Old nagios CVE

So I'm just doing some spring cleaning:

http://www.nagios.org/news/77-news-announcements/133-nagios-302-and-212-released

nagios cross-site scripting in statusmap.cgi

we have this as found and reported towards the end of 2008, the public
update was 2009 so this will need a 2008 CVE, thanks.
