There's two different resumption mechanisms. Both involve accessing the
key material, what differs is where/how it's retained.

session-ids: The server assigns an id to the key material and sends the
id to the client. This requires the server to keep state but is widely
supported by all clients (SSLv3 does that already)

session-tickets: The server creates a ticket containing the encrypted
key material and asks the client to safekeep it for him. This doesn't
require the server to keep any state and therefore scales better... but
is a TLS extension that not all clients support.


In practice, even if key session-ids are in use, the key material might
leave the server (a very common setup is to have a memcache server store
the key material for all servers in a datacenter). This is configured
using SSLSessionCache.

Session Tickets are about "making it scale in very large environment
(several datacenters)" or "when memory is limited (think embedded/IoT)"

Yes. The problem doesn't just affect browsers... and it's not "just" PFS
either.

Some people go out of their way to try to have more than 128bits of
security or to use non-AES based ciphers... their efforts are likely to
be vain if session tickets as OpenSSL issues them are issued.

Don't get me wrong, I think that session tickets are a good thing and
that all clients should have support for it... but as far as the server
side implementations go, I agree with you; they shouldn't be enabled by
default.

Whether it's Google, Facebook, Twitter, youname it, they all had to
reimplement their own session ticket magic; it hopefully does the right
thing (PFS wise).
