Subject: CVE request: spencer regexp

Hi,
please assign a CVE ID for this:

http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/695940
https://guidovranken.wordpress.com/2015/02/04/full-disclosure-heap-overflow-in-h-spencers-regex-library-on-32-bit-systems/

This affects multiple source packages including local copies of the
code. However, in many cases the code is only used when building for
Android or Windows.

Current WIP status for source packages in Debian:

Cheers,
