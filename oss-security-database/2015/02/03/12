Some additional info: This code is shared with cabextract. I recently
also reported issues to the author that were all fixed in
the cabextract 1.5 and libmspack 0.5alpha releases.
(The author was unaware that I am not part of debian, so he only
mentions Debian fixes in the release notes - but these include the
fixes for the issues reported by me).

Rundown of issues I found:

All found with american fuzzy lop.

(P.S.: Do we have a policy on attachments on this list? I was unsure if
it'd be apprechiated that I attach the issue-exposing samples)
