Hi folks.

By reviewing our mysql and mariadb issues we correlated this unknown issue
to a bugreport submitted to us by an external researcher.

CVE-2014-4274

https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=857678

The bugreport also has a reproducer.

Stefan "nordi" Nordhausen reported this issue to both Oracle and to us on
7th of January 2014.

Oracle fixed it in their 2014oct CPU.
MariaDB fixed it in 10.0.13 I think.


We had sadly lacked disclosure timeline control on this issue and reactions on
Oracle side were also, errm, delayed.

Ciao, Marcus
