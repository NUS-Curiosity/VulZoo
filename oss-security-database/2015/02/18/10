Subject: CVE request: xrdp

Starting with glibc 2.17 (eglibc 2.17), crypt() fails with EINVAL (w/
NULL return) if the salt violates specifications. Additionally, on
FIPS-140 enabled Linux systems, DES or MD5 encrypted passwords passed to
crypt() fail with EPERM (w/ NULL return).

It was discovered by Ken Milnore that xrdp 0.6.1 and earlier, when
validating user accounts against plain passwd files or via shadow-utils,
does not check for NULL returns from crypt(). [1]

--- sesman/verify_user.c ---
  encr = crypt(pass,salt);
  if (g_strncmp(encr, hash, 34) != 0)
  {
    return 0;
  }
  return 1;
----------------------------

A NULL return crashes the xrdp-sesman daemon resulting in an xrdp server
denial of service (for all modules that use xrdp's session manager for
user authentication via old-style passwd files or via shadow passwords).

This has been fixed by upstream in its development branch. [2]

Please allocate a CVE for this issue.

Thanks.
