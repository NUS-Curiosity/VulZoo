 Overflow Vulnerability in match()

Thanks for your explanation.
 It has also been confirmed from PHP that this is not a bug of their
product:

"
We cannot do much for it.
Increase the stack of your server (apache has an option for that for
example) or simplify your regex.
One should really not feed pcre with custom inputs :)
"

Cheers, Wen.

AFAIK this is not a bug on PHP at all, this is a long time known issue
on PCRE lib instead.
Check the documentation for futher
