we want to request a CVE for the vulnerability discussed in your mail:

> > In WordPress 4.1 and higher, files with invalid or unsafe names could
> > be uploaded. Discovered by Michael Kapfer and Sebastian Kraemer of
> > HSASec.

The vulnerability was fixed with the update 4.1.2 and was (according to your assumption) located in this call graph:
ï¿¼
- /wp-admin/async-upload.php : (Index)
- - /wp-admin/includes/ajax-actions.php : wp_ajax_upload_attachment
- - - /wp-includes/functions.php : wp_check_filetype_and_ext
- - - - /wp-includes/functions.php : wp_check_filetype

The validation of filenames in "/wp-includes/functions.php : wp_check_filetype" failed under certain circumstances if the user provided filename contains special chars of regular expressions.
	
Exploiting this vulnerability enables users with any fileupload-privilege to upload and execute any type of files. This results in the ability of executing arbitrary code.
