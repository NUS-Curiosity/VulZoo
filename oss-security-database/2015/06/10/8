Subject: CVE=2015-1234 disambiguation

Hello,

I've spotted this on fulldisclosure mailing list today:
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Jun/17

It says CVE-2015-1234 was assigned to that issue, which I think is
wrong, because this same CVE was mentioned by Google in their Chrome
update in April 2015 [1]
http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.cz/2015/04/stable-channel-update.html

Can someone sched some light here?
Explicitely added cve-assign, and Justin Burke (fuldisclosure post
author).

Thanks.
