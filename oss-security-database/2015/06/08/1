Subject: Suggestions Sought for Appsec Reading List

Hi oss-sec readers!

Earlier this year, we decided to start a curated list for learning about
application security and host it on Github.

Currently, we have a good spread of general topics and PHP-specific
security pitfalls, but we'd like to gather more resources to help
developers with experience in a particular language learn how to build more
resilient applications.

The list lives at that URL, please send pull requests. It's as easy as
creating a .json file somewhere appropriately within the data/ directory;
I'll take care of the rest.
