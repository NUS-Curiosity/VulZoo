This can have a single CVE ID, CVE-2015-4625.

With only this change, the original report of "another process can
generate 2^32 authentication sessions and just disconnect immediately.
The counter gets incremented but the cookies never get removed from
the list, until eventually counter wraps and a second cookie is
minted." would still be considered an implementation error, but it
could no longer be considered "exploitable" in the context of the
current polkit security model. In other words, because the two
concerns (90832 and 90837) are not independent vulnerabilities, there
should not be two CVE IDs.
