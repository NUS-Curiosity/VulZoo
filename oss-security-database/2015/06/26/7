Subject: Re: CVE Request: Anchor CMS - Multiple Stored and DOM Based XSS issues

Adding Further details regarding the issue: (sorry for not including the
details in the first mail).

1)
*Stored/Persistent XSS: *
While creating a new page (any authenticated user can create a new page),
the page title is not properly sanitized before saving the input the
database and hence users inject their own payloads. A sample POC can be
trying to give the following payload while adding a new page:

Page title = *page"onmouseover="alert(1)";*

Same injection can be also done on username field while creating a new user
or when editing an already existing user. So any user can purposefully add
JavaScript along with his name. If the user profile page is visited by the
admin or any other users, it will trigger the JavaScript.

2) *DOM Based XSS:*

DOM Based XSS occurs under every single URL below* /admin/*. A sample POC
can be:

http://localhost/anchor-cms/admin/posts/%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E
 <http://localhost/anchor-cms/admin/%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E>
ttp://localhost/anchor-cms/admin/%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E
<http://localhost/anchor-cms/admin/%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C/script%3E>
