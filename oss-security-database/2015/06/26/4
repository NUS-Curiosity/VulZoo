Subject: CVE-2015-3258 cups-filters: texttopdf heap-based buffer overflow

Hi,

A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the way the texttopdf
utility of cups-filters processed print jobs with a specially crafted
line size. An attacker being able to submit print jobs could exploit
this flaw to crash texttopdf or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

This was discovered by Petr Sklenar of Red Hat.

This is fixed in cups-filters 1.0.70.

Patch:
http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7363

Minor note on the side: The commit thanks me for the patch. The patch
was created by Tim Waugh of Red Hat, I've merely forwarded it.

Thanks,
