I have not tried this, but here's some context:

Most browsers have issues where they do not update the URL bar when
content from a different is shown (i.e., the update happens to late), or
they show the new URL while still displaying old content (update too
late).  I've seen such discrepancies with Firefox, but I don't know if
it's still present in current versions.

If such bugs are present, freezing browsers while they are showing
inconsistent content (hence the DoS attempt) could lead the user to
attribute content to the incorrect site.
