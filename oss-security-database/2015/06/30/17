CVE covers the CWE-276 ("Incorrect Default Permissions") issue and
similar weak-permissions issues as long as a security boundary is
crossed. A security boundary would be crossed on a general-purpose,
multi-user computer, as well as on most other multi-user platforms.
Typically there is an exception in the case of an embedded device
where a multi-user level of access control isn't set up and wasn't
ever intended or documented by the vendor. For example, obtaining an
OS image of an arbitrary embedded device, and noting that it has a
filesystem that supports file permissions, doesn't necessarily imply
anything about what those permissions were supposed to be.
