Subject: CVE Request: UDP checksum DoS

Hi

AFAICS there wasn't a CVE requested for the following:

https://twitter.com/grsecurity/status/605854034260426753

> remote DoS via flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums

It has been fixed in v4.1-rc7:

Could you assign a CVE for this issue?

Thanks in advance,

Regards,
Salvatore
