No, in general, repackaging doesn't mean that there can be new CVEs as
a result of a reevaluation of whether any part of a product's
configuration/behavior would have been chosen differently if it had
been the repackager's own original code.

There can, however, be new CVEs for new interaction errors. For
example, if a Linux distribution shipped that product with upstream's
standard default config-file permissions, but simultaneously shipped a
setup tool that required a password in the database URI (without
addressing file permissions during setup, and without showing the file
contents to the user), then there would need to be a CVE for
something, because there is no way to use that combination safely.
Most likely the CVE would name the setup tool as the primary affected
product/component.

This would apply in essentially the same way if it weren't a
standalone setup tool, but were instead a module for a larger
configuration-management product. If a module is intended to modify
configuration files, it seems that the module author has (at least
some) responsibility for avoiding introduction of vulnerabilities into
the configuration. This configuration-management module topic may have
some open questions. However, as far as we know, people haven't been
submitting many CVE requests about vulnerabilities that were caused
when a module didn't incorporate complete knowledge of
configuration-file semantics.

We agree that this is a straightforward case that would have a CVE.
This is, more or less, an extreme example of the setup-tool case
described above: either way, the vendor has forced the product into an
always-unsafe state.
