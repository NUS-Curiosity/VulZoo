Subject: Possible CVE Request: Multiple stack overflows in squashfs-tools and
 sasquatch

I recently discovered several highly similar stack overflow weakness in squashfs-tools and sasquatch.
This issue has already been made public to both projects, with recommendations on how to fix them, but a fix has not been released by the project maintainers.

Sasquatch is an experimental fork of squashfs-tools.
Squashfs-tools is present in the repositories of Debian, CentOS, and other Linux distributions.

The vulnerability can be exploited by using the unsquashfs command to unpack a malicious squashfs image that causes a stack overflow in an unchecked variable length array.
Thereafter, a function that copies data from the squashfs image to the overflown array is executed.

Iâ€™m requesting a CVE number for this vulnerability,  per project.

Title: Stack overflows in squash-fs
Products: squash-fs
Affects: All versions
Type: Stack overflow
First CVE ID Request: Yes

Title: Stack overflows in sasquatch

Thanks in advance,
