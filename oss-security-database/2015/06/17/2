Could you clearify if this CVE assignment is correct? I noticed that
Red Hat Bugzilla has
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1231816 (CVE-2015-1850)
for the nova issue and similarly
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1231817 (CVE-2015-1851)
for the cinder issue. Is this correct?

Regards and thanks in advance,
Salvatore
