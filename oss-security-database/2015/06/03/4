Subject: CVE request Linux kernel: udf: information leakage when reading
 symlink

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the UDF file system(CONFIG_UDF_FS) support is 
vulnerable to an information leakage issue. It could occur while reading 
symlink information from corrupted/malicious udf file system image.

An unprivileged user could use this flaw to leak kernel memory bytes.

Upstream fix:
