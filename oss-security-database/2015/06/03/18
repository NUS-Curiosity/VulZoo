What makes uudecode different is that the discovery was an
out-of-bounds read, and uudecode is neither a library nor a
multiple-input program. (Wireshark is a multiple-input program in the
sense that it is commonly used for live packet capture, and must
remain running to capture packets that are sent later. Some other
programs are multiple-input programs because they maintain the state
of multiple sessions.)

In these situations (i.e., OOB-read library=no multiple-input=no),
obtaining a CVE ID currently requires a realistic scenario with a
security impact. One class of scenarios, as mentioned, is data
exfiltration. Another possible class of scenarios involves a read
operation that triggers a change to the program's control flow.

We're not sure that it would be worthwhile to try to document (in
advance) all possible combinations of product attributes and issue
categories, in order to suggest which combinations need more impact
analysis than others.

Also, we realize that some oss-security readers may be very interested
in crash reports that ultimately cannot have CVE IDs. For example,
these reports may help to suggest a specific type of code-quality
problem in a named product, and that information could be quite useful
in choosing the direction of follow-on research into exploitable
problems in that product.
