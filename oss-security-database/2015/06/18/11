Can you clarify the security impact? We have not looked into the code
paths or the overall product design. Is this a process that is
specific to one FTP client? Is the problem that the gl_errfunc
assignment doesn't occur and there is always a dereference of a NULL
function pointer? Is there a commonly relevant consequence other than
the ability of an FTP client to conduct a DoS attack against its own
session?
