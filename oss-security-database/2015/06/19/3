Subject: Re: CVE request: Content type spoofing in ruby gem paperclip <4.2.2

OSVDB noticed that this seems to be CVE-2015-2963

http://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN83881261/index.html (no idea why they call it an
XSS)

https://robots.thoughtbot.com/paperclip-security-release is the official
notification and just references the commit message.
