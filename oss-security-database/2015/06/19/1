Subject: Re: Bug#786909: chromium: unconditionally downloads binary blob

Since this made it to LWN [0] and Y Combinator [1] with an incredible
amount of misinformation, let's attempt a (hopefully) non-hyped
conversation about this, which unfortunately didn't happen a few days
ago.

Except that the actual contents of the downloaded files in many ways
do not actually matter.  Those files are nacl executables, which are
sandboxed in any nacl-enabled chromium, so barring a sandbox escape
included in the files, this is functionally the same as visiting any
nacl website (less the fact that hotword automatically gets microphone
permission, which itself is worth independent critique).

Additionally, the Debian packages are intentionally built with nacl
disabled (in fact not built at all).  So, at least on Debian, even if
the downloaded files were in fact malicious, without a nacl
interpreter present, there is absolutely no way to trigger the
badness.

Maybe now it's clear that a meaningful conversation at the time would
have preempted the ensuing misinformation campaign.

I simply do not follow the logic leading to this conclusion.  How does
engaging in discussion lead to any specific problem being ignored
exactly?

Anyway, if some incredibly basic homework had been done, you could
have convinced yourself of the non-issue nature of this problem,
rather than engaging in unfounded speculation.

That is exactly what Debian unstable is for, and in many ways it
worked as intended, except for the special snowflake that is chromium.
Since major chromium versions get uploaded to both unstable and stable
to fix security issues, problems introduced into unstable also
unfortunately get introduced to stable.

Well, it is out there now [0,1], unfortunately with a huge amount of
misinformation.

Anyway the Debian security tracker is tracking this [2].  As stated
there, it will be fixed along with the next incoming round of chromium
security issues.  It is absolutely not worth fixing on its own.

Best wishes,
Mike
