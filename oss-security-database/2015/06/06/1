Subject: CVE Request: bson-ruby DoS and possible injection

Hi,

Egor Homakov recently disclosed a vulnerability in the `bson` rubygem as
seen here: http://sakurity.com/blog/2015/06/04/mongo_ruby_regexp.html

Could we please get a CVE?

By submitting a specially crafted string to a service relying on the bson
rubygem, an attacker may trigger denials of service or even inject data
into victim's MongoDB instances.

Users are advised to update to versions >= 3.0.4 of the `bson` rubygem.
Relevant commits can be seen here:

Thanks!,
