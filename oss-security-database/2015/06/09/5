Some requests are delayed because of complexity in deciding how 
vulnerability information can be best represented in CVE. If there is a 
vulnerability-research category, aspect, or approach that we feel may have 
unexpected concerns that are specific to CVE, we prefer to resolve that 
within our team, rather than follow a piecemeal approach to the related 
individual requests. Accordingly, we do not designate a timeline that 
applies globally to every request. If anyone needs additional confirmation 
that a request has indeed been received and read, and that we are aware of 
it remaining unanswered, sending directly to the cve-assign@...re.org 
address is the best option.
