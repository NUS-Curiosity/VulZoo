The unstated rationale here seems to be "ntp-keygen is a command-line
program that is not normally exposed in a way that crosses privilege
boundaries."

The documentation mentions:

  After setting up the environment it is advisable to update certificates
  from time to time, if only to extend the validity interval.
  Simply run
  @code{ntp-keygen}
  with the same flags as before to generate new certificates

It seems plausible that some sites may have created a web interface so
that operations staff can occasionally do a certificate update (maybe
with a new key), but these staff don't have login access to the
machine running NTP. The flaw would give them the new ability to
(sometimes) launch a CPU consumption attack. However, we have not
actually heard of anyone with a web-based ntp-keygen arrangement, so
we currently don't want to assign a CVE ID for that.

Use CVE-2015-3405 for this code error that results in a key space
that's much smaller than expected.
