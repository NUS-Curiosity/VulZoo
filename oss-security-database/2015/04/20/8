Yes, there can be a CVE mapping for this. However, because there's
additional information in https://www.illumos.org/issues/5853 that's
not discussed in your message, we don't know whether one or two CVE
IDs is the correct number.

If each of the two observations of "default error is negative one.
However, callers are expecting errnos or zero." and "we're supposed to
be checking the alignment of two different offsets, pfr_loff and
pfr_ioff, but end up checking pfr_loff twice" could be independently
exploitable, then there will be two CVE IDs. If only one is
exploitable, or if exploitation requires both, then there will be one
CVE ID.

The cve-assign@...re.org address can be used for non-public requests
for illumos CVEs. There may be other options for the open-source
parts, but we think that not all of illumos is open source.
http://wiki.illumos.org/display/illumos/illumos+FAQs says "There still
remain some binary-only, closed source components that we inherited
from Oracle." If the component also affects an Oracle product, then
Oracle could assign the CVE ID.
