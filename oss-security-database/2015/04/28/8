I think the issues here are vulnerabilities in plugins.

Sources:
https://scrutinizer-ci.com/blog/php-security-analysis-finds-xss-vulnerability-in-popular-wordpress-plugins
https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/
https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-xss-vulnerability-affecting-multiple-wordpress-plugins.html

The sucuri blog post lists a whole number of affected plugins. Maybe at
least the more popular ones (jetpack, wordpress seo, google analytics
by yoast, all in one seo) should get their own CVEs.
