If the person is already very familiar with what types of issues
are included in CVE, and what requests should go to MITRE
rather than to the vendor, then we are usually most concerned
with counting vulnerabilities. In other words, minimum
information for a report about one open-source product could be:

 - is part of the report about a vulnerability affecting one
   version, and another part of the report about a vulnerability
   affecting a different version?

 - is part of the report about a vulnerability that became public
   at one point in time, and another part of the report about a
   vulnerability that became public at a different point in time,
   such that customers may realistically have an installation that
   already has a fix for only the first part?

 - is part of the report about a vulnerability discovered by one
   person/organization, and another part of the report about a
   vulnerability discovered by a different person/organization?

 - is there any reasonable interpretation that part of the report
   is about one "vulnerability type" and another part of the report
   is about a different "vulnerability type"? (We know that there
   is no possible definition of "vulnerability type" that makes
   sense for every conceivable security-research effort that may be
   occurring now or in the future.)

"already very familiar" isn't the common case, though.
