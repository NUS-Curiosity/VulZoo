Subject: CVE request - TelescopeJS Information Leakage: User BCrypt password
 hash post-authentication

Hi,

TelescopeJS leaks the users BCrypt password hash in incoming websocket
messages once the user has authenticated. Due to the fact that TelescopeJS
is an expressjs web application, it uses the model of storing session
information in the browsers localStorage.

This means that if an attacker is able to find a single cross-site
scripting flaw in MeteorJS, they would then be able to extract the users
password hash from incoming websocket messages. This hash could then be
cracked.

The bcrypt hash is sent in incoming websocket messages every time the user
object is needed by the application.

This vulnerability affects TelescopeJS installations below version 0.15.

If any more details are required, please let me know.

Thank you,
Shubham
