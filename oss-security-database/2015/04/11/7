Hi Kurt,

Murray McAllister handled the response to this when I reported it to secalert@
but it's currently languishing in BZ#1126713

If you want I can send my patch as a starting point - it got really
nasty because
nobody considered that strong sums would be >16 bytes when writing rsync.

Regards,
  Michael
