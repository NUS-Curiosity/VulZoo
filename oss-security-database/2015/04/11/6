Subject: Re: Re: [CVE Requests] rsync and librsync collisions

If you'd like Red Hat can:

1) handle disclosure coordination (like we do for OpenSSL)

and/or

2) handle patching/etc, we ship rsync so this is obviously of interest
to us.

Contact secalert@...hat.com if you want and either myself or a coworker
will handle this. Thanks!
