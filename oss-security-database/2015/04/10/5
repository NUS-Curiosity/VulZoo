I believe this kind of issues is not considered security / needing CVE
without further justification.  The problem here only occurs if
malloc(small_value) fails.  Considering how small the value is and that
it's not attacker controlled, it's fairly non-obvious if attacker has
any practical chance of triggering this bug.
