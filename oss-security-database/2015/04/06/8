We think your question is based on a misinterpretation of what we
wrote. To avoid that, we shouldn't have started a sentence with "As
far as we can tell, the patches don't address."

wasn't intended to mean:

  The patches are inadequate because a separate scenario exists,
  and that separate scenario is not addressed by the patches.

Instead, it was intended to mean:

  We are not disputing that the patches are adequate. Also, in our
  current understanding, all attack scenarios ultimately depend on the
  previously incorrect handling of renames. Because there isn't a
  second type of scenario, there isn't a second CVE ID.
