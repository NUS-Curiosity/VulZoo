Subject: Remote file inclusion in django-markupfield

Hey folks,

An arbitrary file inclusion bug was discovered in django-markupfield.

A CVE was issued from Debian, CVE-2015-0846, but the commit is public in
the upstream repo, so this mail is to avoid deduplication of this issue.

Sorry about this mishandling,

Thanks,
  Paul
