Note that this and your request are about two different wordpress releases (at
first I got confused too by the version numbers, 4.1.2 != 4.2.1).

This blog post seems to be about the same issue fixed in 4.2.1: it talks about
comments length when inserted in the database, which is what commit [0] seems
to fix (basically the only commit in the 4.2.1 release [1]). Also, both the
wordpress announce and the blog post credit the vulnerability discovery to the
same person.

(All this to say that we need CVEs for both the 4.1.2 and the 4.2.1 releases:
they fix different issues).

Cheers
