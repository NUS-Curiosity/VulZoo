This is probably not a good idea, considering such an increasing interest for this list :)

Is there any reason for this separation? Is this something the upstream projects desire? We all want the same thing, we all care about security, that is why people want to be on this list. Is this an attempt to punish companies and their open source users just because these companies also have closed source products? What is unfree with Enea Linux?

I think it is good that more people show interest in security and want to be on the list. If being on this list helps security updates to spread more quickly, why not let these people/distros in as long as they are serious, reliable and follow the rules and processes.
