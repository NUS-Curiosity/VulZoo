I guess Ubuntu has to be dropped from the linux-distros then, because
www.ubuntu.com appears to be http-only and the ISO download is entirely
insecure. The security notices are also served insecurely there:

http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/

Am I missing something... ? It doesn't make much sense to criticize this
when you folks are doing the same. I do get the impression that Enea
Linux is handling security poorly (where are all of the other issues?)
but this bothered me.
