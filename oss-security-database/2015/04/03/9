 All advisories should have a correspondent patch, Can you please let me

Yes, we failed here, this was sent by one of our engineers (and not the security team) while I was attending ELC and Open Embedded.

I agree, we have plan to provide patches in a more secure way. Our intension is to do 
more for security. Security for embedded customers has not been a high prio in the 
past since most of these devices are isolated, not connected to the outside world. This
is however changing and thus security is becoming important.
To become a member in the Linux-distros list is not the only security concern for us, 
this is one of the items on our list.  This is a sign that we care about security, and we 
want to be part of this community, to contribute back to this community as much as we
can and also get help and inspiration to improve.

Patches to our customers are handled differently, basically the way each of our customers require. The publically available patches are primarily for non-customer Enea Linux users, but still we should provide security updates in a secure way.
Please note that Enea Linux is used in the embedded systems, so our customers don't want every day (binary/source code) patches. Some embedded devices are not easy to update. Instead we often deliver e.g. monthly updates or when the customer desires the update.
