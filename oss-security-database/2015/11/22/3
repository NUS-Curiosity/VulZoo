As far as we can tell, what you mean is that:

  - http://www.xmlsoft.org/news.html mentions 10 CVE IDs

  - the descriptions of those CVE IDs seem largely unrelated to
    either 751603 or 751631

  - also, there is discussion in 751631 about possibly not having
    a CVE ID

  - the cve-assign@...re.org address was on your Cc line

and thus your own preference is for your research to have a CVE mapping
when possible.

Use CVE-2015-8317 for both 751603 and 751631.

In the case of a widely used library, a vulnerability in git code,
without an affected upstream release, can sometimes have a CVE ID.
However, it would be necessary to establish that a product used the
vulnerable code. For example, at least in the past, one of the
principal libxml2 users was Chrome. At present, it seems that Chromium
is using parserInternals.c from 2.9.2, not from unreleased git code
(download
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/libxml/src/parserInternals.c?format=TEXT
and then base64 decode that and compare it to the 2.9.2 file). Our
guess is that it is unlikely that this specific xmlNextChar
vulnerability affected a product; we are not planning to research
this, but other people can research it if they wish. There is
currently no CVE ID for 751643.
