Subject: CVE request -- Linux kernel: selinux: rate-limit unrecognized
 netlink message warnings in selinux_nlmsg_perm()

It was found that the kernel produces unlimited number of warning
messages in case certain malformed NETLINK packets are received.

A local, unprivileged user could generate such packets unlimitedly
and potentially flood the kernel and the system log with excessive
warning messages.

Upstream patch proposal:
