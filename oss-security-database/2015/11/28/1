Subject: CVE request: XSS to RCE in PHP-Fusion 9

I discovered a stored XSS vulnerability in PHP-Fusion 9 that can result in
RCE. Robots.php is an administration tool that allows an administrator with
access to this feature to modify the robots.txt file.

The robots.txt editor fails to sanitize the robots.txt file content as it
loads the <textarea> content. Someone who has access to this tool, can
submit a malicious payload to the contents of the robots.txt file.

When a higher privileged user browses the robots.txt editor, the XSS
payload does a silent ajax request to /administration/banners.php and pulls
out their hidden CSRF token. It then uses their syphoned CSRF token and
performs an ajax POST request to the banners page with PHP code that is
then executed unbeknownst to the victim, resulting in a reverse TCP shell
to an attackers server.

A working payload can be found here:

The issue has been resolved in the following commit:

https://github.com/php-fusion/PHP-Fusion/commit/f1a5fce791e2392d5a23a6d62ab65c481cdd6a66

This breaks a trust boundary as a user with access to only the robots.txt
editor can use this to escalate their privileges, read files or gain a
reverse TCP shell on the server.

Please assign a CVE ID to this issue. A request was sent to MITRE directly
18 days ago with no response.

Thanks,

Brendan Scarvell
