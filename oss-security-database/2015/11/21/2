Subject: CVE request for LightDM - XDMCP denial of service

Hi,

it seems that some versions of LightDM (1.14 and 1.16 series) are vulnerable
to a denial of service when XDMCP server is enabled. When that's the case, an
XDMCP request with no address will crash LightDM.

More information can be found in https://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm/+bug/15168
31 and the bug is fixed with 1.14.4 and 1.16.6 (and development release
1.17.2).

Can a CVE be assigned to this?

Thanks in advance,
