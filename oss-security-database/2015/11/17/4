We think this may be similar to the
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/11/03/11 case in which
the product isn't a library, and typically doesn't need to remain
running after bad input is encountered. A possible exception to the
latter is "mplayer -slave" but, in that situation, it appears that an
attack would not cross privilege boundaries. If the attacker is able
to send slave commands, and wants to kill the mplayer process, they
can send a "quit" command (or, with slightly more complexity, a "run"
command).

> Upstream is notified.

A CVE ID may be available if the upstream response indicates that the
out-of-bounds reads allow the attacker to change the flow of control.
