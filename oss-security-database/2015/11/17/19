The MITRE CVE team has no current plans to provide a CVE ID associated
with the Apache Commons Collection product for its behavior described
at:

  https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache_commons_statement_to_widespread

and elsewhere. Our interpretation is that some people are taking a
position that, very roughly, corresponds to:

 - suppose that a library product is very difficult to deploy safely
   in a use case involving untrusted input

 - furthermore, suppose that part of this library product has
   semantics that are inconsistent with the usual semantics for the
   programming language in use

 - furthermore, suppose that a number of applications are actually
   using this library in a very unsafe way

 - furthermore, suppose that the vendor of this library product has
   decided to change this product's behavior so that (among other
   differences) it will sometimes be easier to deploy safely

 - furthermore, suppose that this vendor's change notification seems
   to be more about hardening the library as a way to help prevent
   exploitation of current or future applications, and seems to be
   less about announcing the original behavior as a library
   vulnerability

 - still, a CVE ID could be used as a name for the original behavior

We prefer not to have a CVE ID for the library product in this
situation. There is a continuum between "inadvertent coding error" on
the left side and "a choice that was reasonable for a smaller than
expected fraction of customers" on the right side. The situation here
is not far enough to the left to have a CVE ID.

The CVE-2015-3253 ID came from the Apache Software Foundation itself,
and thus can't be generalized to other cases that may seem similar.

The CVE-2015-4852 ID came from Oracle and must remain associated only
with Oracle's own software (WebLogic Server is the product they've
named).

We'll send a separate response about the Jenkins SECURITY-218 report.
