Actually, yes, a CVE was assigned a while ago: CVE-2015-7805.

We realize that the www.nemux.org URL says "09 Oct 2015 Mitre.org
contacted (no response)"; however, we actually did respond on that
day. (The person who wanted a CVE ID wrote to us from two e-mail
addresses, one of which did not work for us. The person wrote to us a
few weeks ago confirming that they did receive the CVE ID. We will
follow up.)
