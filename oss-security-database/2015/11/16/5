Is it really a vulnerability?  All the code does is read 4 bytes from a 
proc file, and reads that into address 0 in the process, which will very 
likely kill it unless that page is mapped somehow, which the code does 
not make any attempt to.  Is the OP mistaking a crashed userlevel 
process with a system-wide crash?

Cheers,
