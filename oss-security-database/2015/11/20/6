It appears that this is the major finding. Use CVE-2015-8308.

This possibly can be included in CVE but, if so, the CVE ID would be
different. Is there any other information, e.g., why was there a
decision to make reset an optional behavior rather than a required
behavior? Is there a possible attack by a different local user, or is
the relevant attack that someone could steal the computer and recover
the authentication cookies (possibly violating an expectation of the
legitimate user who believed they were safely logged out)? Is the
behavior different from all major display managers?
http://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXDM says "LXDM is the lightweight display
manager ..." -- is the design tradeoff possibly different on a
low-resource machine where it's very expensive to restart the X server?
