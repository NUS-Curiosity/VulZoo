Subject: CVE request -- linux kernel: Null pointer dereference when mounting
 ext4 filesystem

Hello,
If possible, we would like to obtain a CVE-ID for the following security issue.

It was reported that there are some exit paths in ext4_fill_super() which result
in destruction of workqueue which is not yet initialized, leading to kernel NULL
pointer dereference. A privileged user with permission to mount a filesystem or
anybody having physical access to the system's USB port and prepared filesystem
on USB disk which will be automatically mounted can cause system panic and thus
DoS.
