This is not a vulnerability in the library.  How can this feature allow
remote code execution if it does not involve any networking at all?

The root cause is the incorrect use of Java deserialization.  As long as
you do not fix that, something else on the classpath will serve the role
of Apache Commons Collections.

Disabling InvokerTransformer deserialization may be a prudent hardening
measure, but calling the existing behavior a vulnerability is a bit of a
stretch.
