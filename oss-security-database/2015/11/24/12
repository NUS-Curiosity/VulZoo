Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Django security releases issued (1.7.11, 1.8.7, and
 1.9rc2)

Today the Django team issued multiple releases -- Django 1.7.11, 1.8.7, and 
1.9rc2 -- as part of our security process. These releases address a 
security issue, and we encourage all users to upgrade as soon as possible.

More details can be found on our blog:

https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/nov/24/security-releases-issued/

As a reminder, we ask that potential security issues be reported via 
private email to security@...ngoproject.com and not via Django's Trac 
instance or the django-developers list. Please see 
https://www.djangoproject.com/security for further information.
