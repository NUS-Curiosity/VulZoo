Subject: CVE Request: IPTables-Parse: Use of predictable names for temporary
 files

Hi

IPTables-Parse up to 1.6 used temporary files in insecure way, since
it used predictable filenames. This issue was fixed in 1.6 with the
following commit:

https://github.com/mtrmac/IPTables-Parse/commit/b400b976d81140f6971132e94eb7657b5b0a2b87

Upstream Changelog:
https://metacpan.org/source/MRASH/IPTables-Parse-1.6/Changes
> (Miloslav Trmač) Fixed a vulnerability to not use predictable names
> for temporary files. This vulnerability would allow an attacker on a
> multi- user system to set up symlinks to overwrite any file the
> current user has write access to. If a user manually overrides the
> temporary file locations with the 'iptout' and 'ipterr' hash keys,
> it is recommended to not use predictable names either.

Can a CVE be assigned for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
