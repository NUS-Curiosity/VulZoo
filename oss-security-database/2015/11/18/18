Use CVE-2015-8234.

We're willing to let the OpenStack VMT have CVEs for mostly arbitrary
types of issues that they want OpenStack customers to treat as
vulnerabilities.
http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/glance-specs/specs/liberty/image-signing-and-verification-support.html
possibly suggests that the behavior represents an intended
intermediate step of feature development: "An alternative to using the
existing MD5 hash algorithm is to create a separate configurable hash
for use with verifying/creating the signature. However, creating a
separate hash negatively affects the performance, without providing
much benefit. Note that since there are preferable hash algorithms to
MD5 that are more secure, a separate change is being proposed to allow
for the configuring of this hash algorithm. This will not be included
as a part of this change, in the interest of having a straightforward
initial implementation." If so, then we think vendors typically
wouldn't want CVEs in these types of situations, unless the
intermediate step actually made something worse than before the
feature development started.
