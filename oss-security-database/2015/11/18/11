Groovy Plugin and its version is unrelated, as Groovy is included in Jenkins core. Jenkins was vulnerable even without Groovy Plugin.

We updated neither commons-collections nor Groovy, the fix for both is specific to Jenkins, in the same component, and was part of the same release of Jenkins. Does this mean the one CVE ID covers both?
