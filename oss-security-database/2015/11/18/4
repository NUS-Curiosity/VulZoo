This approach makes sense to me, but I think we should have a better
idea of whether and how "a point where ROP gadgets are reasonably hard
to find & exploit" is potentially reachable.  If it is not even
potentially reachable, then this undermines the effort, unfortunately.

Also, "hard" might be a wrong goal.  More important is making attacks
less reliable or/and less generic, such as through forcing them to be
more complex or/and to rely on more aspects of the target system.

Overall, this might be a worthwhile effort - it's just that I'd like to
see a more convincing potential plan early on, even if the individual
mitigations would be getting upstreamed one by one (as they should be).

Thanks,

Alexander
