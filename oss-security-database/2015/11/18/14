That was a detail we discussed internally. I'll need to look at it again 
but the idea was to make those kinds of epilogues less useful. Maybe 
Florian can comment.

There's also the contification thing (although now I've googled it I'm 
not sure that's really the right term). I currently envision this as 
follows: instead of using a call instruction, we push an index into a 
table of known return addresses and convert returns into essentially a 
switch. I think that can be made to work entirely inside the compiler 
for static functions (LTO might help to enlarge the scope). I could also 
imagine a more involved approach involving linker trickery.
