Subject: CVE request - Linux kernel - Unix sockets use after free -
 peer_wait_queue prematurely freed

Gday,


A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of Unix sockets(AF_UNIX).  A
server polling for data coming from a client socket may put the peer
socket on a wait list.  This peer may close the connection making
the reference on the wait list no longer valid. A determined attacker
could poison this memory and lead to bypassing permissions on a the socket, 
and packets being injected into the stream.  This may also panic the machine.

Thanks,

Wade Mealing
