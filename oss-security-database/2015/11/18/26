Thank you.

I'm not 100% sure, but I think it was not considered to be a
vulnerability as such because, while it's indeed unambiguously wrong,
it doesn't directly present a vulnerability.  It's only, like you say,
when an application prohibits only '/' characters, when this results in
a vulnerability.

I trust your judgement on this, so if this is worth a CVE ID, please
assign one.
