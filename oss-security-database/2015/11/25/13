Totally reasonable, Kurt.
Where would you actually see the border between what's in and what's
out? Actually there are lots of (proprietary source) vendor products out
there that are heavily built on open source (e.g. virtually all linux
kernel based embedded devices)
Not saying someone should go through the hassles to chase for it - but
if the info is brought to you/to the repository...
