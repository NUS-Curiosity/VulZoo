Because this is the Open Source Security mailing list, and I work for a
company (Red Hat) that does Open Source and because I have no interest in
the hassles of dealing with proprietary software (legal
threats/licensing/DMCA/etc.).

If you would like to work with proprietary vendors on such an effort I
welcome you to try, you can easily setup a project on GitHUB and move ahead
without any need to coordinate with the Open Source effort.
