https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/Certificates-Shipped/

The idea is to create a comprehensive list of shipped certs/keys/etc by
open source vendors/distributions/projects so that:

1) we have a list of secrets maintained by external parties that we rely
upon
2) we can audit them and make sure we should be trusting them
3) also spot changes more easily (since the existing corpus is available)

I'm guessing there are some surprises waiting for us.
