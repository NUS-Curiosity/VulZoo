Subject: Major outstanding CVE requests

So we have a number of PCRE issues that need CVE's and a git issue that
needs a CVE (at this point we've actually shipped an update for it, most of
these requests are more than a month old, and several are 2-3 months old.
Red Hat needs CVE's for these, as do other vendors I'm sure. I know it's
thanksgiving in the USA right now, but the backlog is becoming a problem.
Can I have permission from Mitre to assign CVE's to these issues?
