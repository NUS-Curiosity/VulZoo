This statement is how we have been operating our mitigation strategy:

"Applications which use Apache Commons Collections and do not use
deserialization are not vulnerable."

Assuming that statement is correct, disabling deserialization by default
doesn't offer additional protection to people. Instead it requires a
code change when they upgrade to re-enable it and cause them to be
vulnerable again.

Would the greater community be better served by additional documentation
on how to safely handle the deserialization in their application? Is
there such a method, or is this hopelessly broken?

If you're still vulnerable even if you don't use deserialization in your
application this completely changes our risk profile and we need to
change our mitigation strategy.
