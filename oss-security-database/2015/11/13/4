 execution on deserialisation flaw

+1
Note that Daniel from Jenkins requested a CVE ID, too (for the Jenkins
Fix [1]. I propose to use the same ID here.
This is btw. the only critical bug (SECURITY-218) without a CVE-ID
included in latest Jenkins release [2].
(...and: kudos to the Jenkins team for acting so quickly and
professional; great work ;-)

Full details of the vulnerability can be found in this recent blog post, [1]. A proposed patch for 3.2.x branch has been submitted upstream, but no release has been made with the fix at the current time. The issue affects version 3.x, and 4.x of Apache common-collections, [2].
