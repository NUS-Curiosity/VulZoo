Is there any proof that Apache Commons Collections functors package
isn't doing what it's intended to be doing? Everything I'm reading
indicates that the problem is with applications believing they can
*trust* the input, not that there's a bug in the functors package, ie,
bad design.

The currently proposed "fix"[1] is to disable functionality that is
being used. This will break applications that need them.
