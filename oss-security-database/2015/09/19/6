Hi,

For some reason the attached image test case didn't make it through.
Gustavo was kind enough to email me a copy and asked me to add it to
our bug for easy public access.

Direct link:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=1075212

Our bug for this issue is here:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264015

PS: FYI, "On September 20th, 2015, 0:00 UTC we will be upgrading the Red
Hat Bugzilla servers in a migration process lasting 10 to 14 hours."

Thanks,
