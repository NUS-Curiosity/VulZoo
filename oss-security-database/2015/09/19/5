Subject: CVE Request: Plone header injection

Hi,

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue, please?

   https://plone.org/security/20150910/header-injection

Users who had access to write cookie values were able to inject headers
into the response. Versions affected are all versions Plone 3. A hotfix has
been posted only as releases are not made of these versions any longer. The
code in question was actually fixed long ago but no CVE was ever assigned
and no hotfix was ever created for older versions of Plone.

The relevant code is:

https://plone.org/security/20150910/

The vendor credits with the discovery: Jan Pokorny from RedHat

Thanks, let me know if you'd like more information.

Nathan
