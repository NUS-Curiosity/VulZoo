That request was about 40 minutes earlier.

Sending the same CVE request to multiple addresses is typically not
what MITRE wants, although you're certainly welcome to change your
mind and decide that you had actually preferred that a CVE request be
publicly archived from the beginning. (It's rare for a vendor to use
oss-security for CVE requests related to "critical" vulnerabilities
that don't yet have a fixed release. The issue descriptions here, in
combination with vendor confirmation, probably make the
vulnerabilities sufficiently public that they are within the scope of
the oss-security list charter. We think the implication is that
readers should look at

  https://code.google.com/p/google-security-research/issues/list?can=1

at a future time, if interested in other details.)
