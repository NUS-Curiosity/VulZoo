Subject: CVE Request: remote triggerable use-after-free in rpcbind

Hi,

One of our customers saw rpcbind crashing on a remote security scan.
Olaf Kirch identified and fixed the problem:

http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-nfs/msg53045.html
https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=946204

It so far has not been integrated into rpcbind upstream.

This is a use-after-free, so at least remote denial of service.
We have not researched further exploitability.

Ciao, Marcus
