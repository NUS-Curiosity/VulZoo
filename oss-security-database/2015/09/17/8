Not a single one of those programs does anything to its input that
ought to be considered any form of interpretation in the sense you
imply.  They simply produce outputs that correspond to their inputs.
If that output is later presented to a terminal emulator, *then* some
characters happen to produce effects that go beyond simply displaying
them as glyphs on a screen, one by one.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with `head`, `tail`, `more`, `curl`,
`wget` or `diff`.  They are not meant to “interpret” anything of the
sort that is being addressed, and indeed they do not.  `less` *does*
have special processing rules active by default for input sequences
that would cause terminals to do anything special; indeed, the default
behaviour of `less`, without the `-r` option, is the only mentioned
behaviour that may be considered a form of interpretation.

Perhaps “most of us” should use `view` to view files.
