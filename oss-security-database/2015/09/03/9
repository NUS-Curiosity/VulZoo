This is slightly off-topic for the current thread, but I think it is of
interest to oss-security subscribers in general:

Dmitry V. Levin pointed out to me off-list that less already provides a
way to specify its normally interactive commands on the command line.
The man page says:

       +cmd   Causes the specified cmd to be executed each time a new file  is
              examined.  For example, +G causes less to initially display each
              file starting at the end rather than the beginning.

and indeed e.g. "less -nUEX +F" works as desired.
