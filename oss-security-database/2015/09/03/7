"tail -f" on a log file is indeed very common, but it is bad practice
(akin to other very common bad practices like a sysadmin going into a
user's homedir as root).  A safer alternative in terms of terminal
escapes is the "F" keypress in "less -nU" (or in "less -nUEX" to more
closely resemble "tail -f").  Unfortunately, I am not aware of a
command-line option that would do this (that is, assume that "F" was
pressed right away) - perhaps one should be added, if it's not already
in there.  Unfortunately, less is more complicated and has greater
attack surface than tail.  Maybe this can be partially mitigated by
using the C locale with it (no UTF-8), but I did not look into that.
