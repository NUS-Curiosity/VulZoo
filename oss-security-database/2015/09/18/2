Subject: CVE Request: Squid HTTP Proxy Denial of Service

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,
 The TLS/SSL parser in the latest series of Squid HTTP Proxy has been
found to have several bugs leading to Denial of Service possibilities.
Can CVE be assigned as appropriate please?

Vulnerable versions are 3.5.0.1 to 3.5.8 (inclusive), which are built
with OpenSSL and configured for "SSL-Bump" decryption.


Integer overflows can lead to invalid pointer math reading from random
memory on some CPU architectures. In the best case this leads to wrong
TLS extensiosn being used for the client, worst-case a crash of the
proxy terminating all active transactions.
Fixed by
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13914.p
atch>.

Incorrect message size checks and assumptions about the existence of
TLS extensions in the SSL/TLS handshake message can lead to very high
CPU consumption (up to and including 'infinite loop' behaviour).
Fixed by
<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13915.p
atch>.


The above can be triggered remotely. Though there is one layer of
authorization applied before this processing to check that the client
is allowed to use the proxy, that check is generally weak. MS Skype on
Windows XP is known to trigger some of these.

(Formal release with advisory will be coming in a few days. 3.5.9
tarballs are available now, via FTP if the web mirrors ).
