Yes, that is correct. I should have rephrased that better, thanks for  
clearing that up.

Also correct. There are several ways one can go about this, but the  
point is, do people actually do that? Do they take that extra care  
sometimes? :)

I'd also like to point out that the title should've been  
"s/party/hack/ like it's 1999", I guess that's what you get when  
you're trying to write up things fast, but that's not really the point  
of the post ;-)

Yes, there are several ways to go about this, but the point is that  
'cat -A file' isn't something that people do in their day to day lives!

I believe some adjustments to the script would make it not jump a line  
for other terminal emulators.
