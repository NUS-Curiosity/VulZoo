Subject: CVE Request - TrueCrypt 7.1a and VeraCrypt 1.14 Local Elevation of
 Privilege


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
 
Hi,

I would like to request two CVE identifiers for the two security issues
described below affecting TrueCrypt 7.1a (latest version) and its fork
VeraCrypt 1.14 (latest version) running on all versions of Windows.

These issues were reported by James Forshaw (Google).

Issue 1: Local Elevation of Privilege on Windows by abusing
              drive letter handling.

Issue 2: Local Elevation of Privilege on Windows caused by incorrect
              Impersonation Token Handling.

Issue 1 is critical.

A fix has already been developed. Version 1.15 of VeraCrypt will be
released soon to address those issues.

For your information, I have sent a similar CVE request to mitre.org.

Regards,
