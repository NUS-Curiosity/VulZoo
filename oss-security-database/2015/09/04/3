Subject: CVE Request: PgBouncer: failed auth_query lookup leads to connection
 as auth_user

Hi

Could you please assign a CVE for the following PgBouncer issue?

>From upstream announce:

https://pgbouncer.github.io/2015/09/pgbouncer-1-6-1/
> New auth_user functionality introduced in 1.6 allows login as
> auth_user when client presents unknown username. Itâ€™s quite likely
> auth_user is superuser. Affects only setups that have enabled
> auth_user in their config.
