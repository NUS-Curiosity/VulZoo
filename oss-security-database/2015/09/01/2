I definitely think it deserves a closer look. Here are three recent
finds that kcwu reported after apparently testing GNU screen with
afl-fuzz:

https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?45713
https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?45715
https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?45714

While I suspect that command injection bugs (the thing that started
the thread) are fairly rare, I fully expect that escape sequence
handling is under-audited and that there's plenty of mem corruption
bugs to be found.

(Cc:ing Hanno in case he wants to have a look.)
