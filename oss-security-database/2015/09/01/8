Subject: CSRF to RCE in Jenkins

Hello,

a CSRF to RCE exploit was published on Bugtraq last week. It affects
Jenkins >= 1.626, including the latest public version. No CVE is
affected (AFAIK) and an exploit should be added to the BeEF Project
soon.

Original post to Bugtraq:

BeEf devs working on an exploit for 1.627:
