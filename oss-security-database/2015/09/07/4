Subject: Heap overflow and DoS in unzip 6.0

Hello,

Two issues were found in unzip 6.0:

* A heap overflow triggered by unzipping a file with password (e.g unzip -p
-P x sigsegv.zip)
* A denegation of service with a file that never finishes unzipping (e.g.
unzip sigxcpu.zip).

Upstream is notified. Nevertheless the test cases as well as the valgrind
and the adress sanitizer reports of the heap overflow case are attached (as
a single file) in case someone wants to provide some feedback. These issues
were found with QuickFuzz.

Regards,
Gustavo.
