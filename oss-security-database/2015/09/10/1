Subject: CVE request Qemu: ide: divide by zero issue

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the IDE disk and CD/DVD-ROM emulation support is 
vulnerable to a divide by zero issue. It could occur while executing an IDE 
command WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX to determine the maximum size of a drive.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu instance 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:
-------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2015-09/msg02479.html

The fix disables undue IDE commands for CD-ROM drives.

Thank you.
