This looks like the relevant fix:

https://cyrus.foundation/cyrus-imapd/commit/?id=07de4ff1bf2fa340b9d77b8e7de8d43d47a33921

This patch seems to fix an information disclosure (out of bounds heap read).

The patch may be incomplete because n could become negative.  I'll ask
on the cyrus-devel list once my subscription request goes through.

This otherwise unrelated commits might be security-relevant as well:
