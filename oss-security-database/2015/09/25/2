*Product Introduction Overview:*
"VuFind is a library resource portal designed and developed for libraries
by libraries. The goal of VuFind is to enable your users to search and
browse through all of your library's resources by replacing the traditional
OPAC to include: Catalog Records, Locally Cached Journals, Digital Library
Items, Institutional Repository, Institutional Bibliography, Other Library
Collections and Resources. VuFind is completely modular so you can
implement just the basic system, or all of the components. And since it's
open source, you can modify the modules to best fit your need or you can
add new modules to extend your resource offerings. VuFind runs on Solr
Energy. Apache Solr, an open source search engine, offers amazing
performance and scalability to allow for VuFind to respond to search
queries in milliseconds time. It has the ability to be distributed if you
need to spread the load of the catalog over many servers or in a server
farm environment. VuFind is offered for free through the GPL open source
license. This means that you can use the software for free. You can modify
the software and share your successes with the community! Take a look at
our VuFind Installations Wiki page to see how a variety of organizations
have taken advantage of VuFind's flexibility. If you are already using
VuFind, feel free to edit the page and share your accomplishments. "
