 glibc gethostbyname buffer overflow

Dear All,

We were asked off-list whether HAProxy is vulnerable to GHOST or not,
and thought others might be interested in the answer as well.  The short
version is:  HAProxy is NOT vulnerable to GHOST.

The slightly longer version is:  we are looking for gethostbyname()
calls whose hostname argument can be controlled by an attacker.  There
are indeed a few calls to gethostbyname() in HAProxy, but their hostname
arguments all depend on the configuration file, in the end, so they are
safe (side note: there is getaddrinfo() support too, but it seems to be
turned on for Solaris only, by default).

Hope this is useful.  With best regards,
