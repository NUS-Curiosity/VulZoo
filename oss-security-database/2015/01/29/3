This would be a bad idea and lead to much confusion, especially for
people that have already consumed this CVE and written up reports that
in turn have been shipped to other people/etc.

Can we REJECT this CVE if the issue is not a security issue, obviously
if it is a security issue we should keep this CVE.

Additionally if we can get a new CVE for Bz981942 that would be great,
thanks!
