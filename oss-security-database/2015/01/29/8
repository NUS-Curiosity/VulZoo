So you'll be doing the work to confirm which ones are/are not, patch
them, regression test the patches and so on? Awesome!

There's a reason we don't treat every potential security flaw as a
security vulnerability. We have finite resources and pretty much an
infinite number of flaws to deal with. Until you solve that problem we
have to make due with "best effort", letting perfection be the enemy of
good will kill us.
