Subject: Re: Assignment of CVE IDs with 5 or more digits by
 January 13, 2015

Might I suggest we use a larger ID (e.g. 6 digit one) for the next
"major" issue in order to effectively force people into compliance? I
fear if it's only 5/6 digits for "minor" issues some orgs/vendors may
try to ignore the issue for a while longer. Alternatively maybe hand out
a few blocks of 5/6 digit ID's to vendors like RHT/MSFT/etc.
