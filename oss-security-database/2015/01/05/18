Subject: Re: CVE request: Concrete5 XSS vulnerability

That report unfortunately fell through the cracks, as you can see on
my reply. Our disclosure program is currently community driven, and
I've taken steps to prevent this from happening to other reports. That
is unfortunate and is completely our fault. Now disclosure for assumed
active bugs outside of our program is still for sure the wrong thing
to do always especially when not accompanied by an email to our
security@...crete5.org address. This would've been resolved quickly
had it been sent to our security@...crete5.org email, so I'd suggest
falling back to that in the future.
