I have to clarify this last part of my CVE request for libmspack. I
mentioned clamav embedding libmspack. Upstream Clamav tarball embeds
an older version of libmspack, which does not seem to be affected by
this problem. The problem itself for libmspack can be reproduced with
https://bugs.debian.org/773041#13 .
