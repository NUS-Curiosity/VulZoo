Subject: CVE Request: libmspack: frame_end overflow which could cause
 infinite loop

Hi,

Jakub Wilk originally reported to the Debian BTS a problem with
cabextract on a specially crafted cab file, causing cabextract to hang
forever. The problem is actually in the embedded copy of libmspack, see
[1]. Libmspack, a library to provide compression and decompression of
some file formats used by Microsoft, is used in many project (or
embedded there like also Clamav). This issue can cause a remotely
exploitable denial-of-service condition due to clamav thread hanging
forever while scanning the file. A patch is available at [2] for
libmspack.

Could you please assign a CVE for this issue in libmspack?
