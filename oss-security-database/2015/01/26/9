Subject: CVE HOWTO - updated and moved to github

https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO

replaces the old
https://people.redhat.com/kseifrie/CVE-OpenSource-Request-HOWTO.html

I'll also be adding some information on SPLIT/MERGE and other details
for people that want to know more. Feedback is welcome, pull requests
even more so.
