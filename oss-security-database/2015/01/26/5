Subject: [OSSA 2015-003] Glance user storage quota bypass (CVE-2014-9623)

===============================================
OSSA-2015-003: Glance user storage quota bypass
===============================================

:Date: January 26, 2015
:CVE: CVE-2014-9623


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Glance: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 versions up to 2014.2.1


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Tushar Patil from NTT reported a vulnerability in Glance. By deleting
images that are being uploaded, a malicious user can overcome the
storage quota and thus may overrun the backend. Images in deleted
state are not taken into account by quota and won't be effectively
deleted until the upload is completed. Only Glance setups configured
with user_storage_quota are affected.
