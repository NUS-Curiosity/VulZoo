Hi,

This bug report is pretty unclear. What is the exact request sent to
allow such a crash? Does it bypass the password security?
Furthermore, due to its design, kgb-bot isn't supposed to be wide
open, but only restricted to kgb-client to send their commit messages.

Anyone with more information?

With my best regards,
