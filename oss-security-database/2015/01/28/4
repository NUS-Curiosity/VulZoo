Dear Qualys team, dear list,

I assume this is an invitation to elaborate ;)

>From GHOST.c :
...
  char name[10];
  memset(name, '0', len);
  name[len] = '\0';
...


len is worth 991 at that point in time. Quite clearly, this will not fit
into 10 bytes :)

I am merely mentioning it in case anyone else was trying to run this code
and was hitting this particular stack overflow.

It is till an epic bug, congratulations on finding it !

Best regards,
