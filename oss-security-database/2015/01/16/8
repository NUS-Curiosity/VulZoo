Could you please elaborate? Citing my email to upstream: 
"--no-absolute-filenames option seems to be intended to limit extracting 
contents of an archive to be strictly inside a current directory (it 
guards against both absolute paths and relative paths with .. in them). 
However it can be bypassed with symlinks [extracted from the archive]."
