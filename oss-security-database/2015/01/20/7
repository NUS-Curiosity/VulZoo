Hi!

I think these issues in patch also deserve CVEs:

https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?44051
"With a specific file, patch goes to infinite loop and eats all CPU time."

https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?44051
"Got an other issue which output this before segfault: patching file util.h

Ran out of memory using Plan A -- trying again...

patching file util.h
Segmentation fault"

http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/?id=44a987e02f04b9d81a0db4a611145cad1093a2d3
"Add line number overflow checking. Based on Robert C. Seacord's INT32-C document for integer overflow checking and Tobias Stoeckmann's "integer overflows and oob memory access" patch for FreeBSD."

Thank you!
