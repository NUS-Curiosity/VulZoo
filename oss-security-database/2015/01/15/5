There's probably no better evidence for the severe usability issues
pgp-based mail has than people on a mailing list of IT security
specialists explaining each other how to properly use it :-)

Having said that: I have a rough kind-of-proposal to fix exactly that
problem. I think pgp not encrypting/signing the subject is one of its
major usability fails.
I'll send my ideas to the gpg dev list soon, will post a link here when
done. Let's see if we can at least fix that.
