Subject: CVE Request for Privoxy Version: 3.0.22

Privoxy Version 3.0.22 has two vulnerabilities that were fixed in the version of Privoxy 3.0.22. Can we please assign CVE(s) to this.

Fixed a memory leak when rejecting client connections due to
the socket limit being reached (CID 66382). This affected
Privoxy 3.0.21 when compiled with IPv6 support (on most
platforms this is the default).


Fixed an immediate-use-after-free bug (CID 66394) and two
additional unconfirmed use-after-free complaints made by
Coverity scan (CID 66391, CID 66376).
