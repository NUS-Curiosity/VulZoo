Sure, it's based on some open-source software, it wouldn't be a linux 
distribution otherwise. But is it open source itself? Actually, I'm not 
sure what does this mean exactly but it's the second distro brought to 
oss-security recently (the first one was Red Star) which seems to be 
more appropriate for full-disclosure than for oss-security.

But maybe it's just me...
