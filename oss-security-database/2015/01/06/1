Subject: CVE Revoke

Hi,

I'm requesting a revoke of the CVE-ID: CVE-2014-9426.
The reason is due to when erealloc fails, it doesn't return, it causes a
bailout.
If erealloc causes a bailout, it is not possible for this double free to
happen.

Discussion here: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=68665&thanks=2


Thanks,
