Subject: Possible CVE request: python-pillow: potential denial-of-service in
 PNG decompression code

Hello,

Pillow release 2.7.0 fixes a potential denial-of-service issue in PNG
decompression code [1].

Exact upstream commit that resolves this:
https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/commit/b3e09122e527ae554eb590741bbd7611d5710e40

[1]: http://pillow.readthedocs.org/releasenotes/2.7.0.html#png-text-chunk-size-limits

Does it deserve a CVE, or it's considered a hardening measure, and not
a vulnerability?

Thanks.
