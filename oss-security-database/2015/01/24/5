This is a somewhat unusual situation in which there is arguably a
single underlying discovery: if any filesystem supports extended
privilege attributes, its setattr operation has a requirement for
certain code that supports the functionality of removing extended
privilege attributes. Previously, there was no such requirement in the
sense that notify_change was (wrongly) expected to support that
functionality. Thus, it seems best to model this as a single security
problem (with a single CVE ID) in which the set of requirements for
setattr operations was incomplete. It does not seem worthwhile to
model this as a series of related security problems (with multiple CVE
IDs) in which individual filesystems had their own independent
implementation errors.

Use CVE-2015-1350.
