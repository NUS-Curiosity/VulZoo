Socat security advisory 6 - Possible DoS with fork

Overview
  socats signal handler implementations are not async-signal-safe and
  can cause crash or freeze of socat processes

Vulnerability Id: (pending)

Severity: Low

Details
  Socats signal handler implementations are not asnyc-signal-safe. When
  a signal is triggered while the process is within a non
  async-signal-safe function the signal handler will call a non
  sync-signal-safe function too. POSIX specifies the behaviour in this
  situation as undefined. Dependend on involved functions, libraries,
  and operating system, the process can continue, freeze, or crash.
  Mostly this issue occurs when socat is in listening mode with fork
  option and a couple of child processes terminate at the same time.
