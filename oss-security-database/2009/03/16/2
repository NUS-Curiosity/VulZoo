Evolution Data Server is not affected since version 2.21.1, as it uses 
GLib's base64 functions. Obviously, using a vulnerable GLib with a 
current Evolution Data Server still presents a vulnerable setup -- 
however the advisory and CVE entry should not reflect that as a 
vulnerability in Evolution Data Server 2.21.1 to 2.24.5.
