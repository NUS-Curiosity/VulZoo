I anchored on this:

which is John Dong's answer to an inquiry I had for how many CVEs to
create:

So CVE-2008-4641 was assigned to issue 4, and CVE-2008-4639 was assigned
to issue 2.  However, I made a mistake in CVE-2008-4639 and said "before
2.84" instead of "2.84 and earlier."  I've since fixed the CVE-2008-4639
description to say ""2.84 and earlier."

Now what's this about 2.86?... Sounds like it may be a regression.
