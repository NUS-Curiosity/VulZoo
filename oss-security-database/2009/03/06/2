Subject: CVE request: kernel: inotify local DoS

According to the upstream commit 3632dee2, if userspace supplies an 
invalid pointer to a read() of an inotify instance, the inotify device's 
event list mutex is unlocked twice. This causes an unbalance which 
effectively leaves the data structure unprotected, and we can trigger 
oopses by accessing the inotify instance from different tasks
concurrently.
