By "dummy auth data," do you mean that it's replaced with real/unique
passwords/keys before the system becomes operational?  Or do these
pre-packaged values work unless the admin RTFM?  (If the latter, then it
needs a CVE; if the former, then there doesn't seem to be a vuln because
there's no impact on authentication).
