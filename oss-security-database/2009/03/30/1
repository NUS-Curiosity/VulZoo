Subject: CVE id request: auth2db

Hi

auth2db uses addslashes() to protect against SQL injections. This should be 
mysql_real_escape_string(), so it also works, if multibyte character 
encodings are used.

Debian Bug report:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=521823

Could I please get a CVE id for this?

Cheers
Steffen
