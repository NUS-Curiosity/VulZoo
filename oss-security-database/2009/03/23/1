Subject: CVE request: kernel: nfsd did not drop CAP_MKNOD for non-root

According to the upstream commit 76a67ec6, an unprivileged client can,
for example, create a device node on a filesystem exported with
root_squash as CAP_MKNOD is not among the capabilities dropped when an
nfsd thread handles a request from a non-root user. I believe this
problem was introduced in upstream commit e338d263a (follows: v2.6.24;
precedes: v2.6.25-rc1).
