Subject: CVE Request - Open Flash Chart v2

The Piwik project released an advisory re: the inclusion of
ofc_upload_image.php -- a potentially exploitable file from the
php-ofc-library offered by the Open Flash Chart project.

Since Open Flash Chart is used by web sites and open source projects,
a common CVE makes sense.

Open Flash Chart:  Affected v2 Beta 1 through v2 Lug Wyrm Charmer.  Fixed: no
Piwki:  Affected: 0.2.35 through 0.4.3.  Fixed in 0.4.4.  (Removed file)
Open Web Analytics:  Affected: 1.2.  Fixed in svn.  (Removed file)
