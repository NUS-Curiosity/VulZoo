Subject:  CVE request: insecure usage of temporary files in docutils

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

Jakub Wilk found an insecure usage of temporary files with predictable names
in the emacs mode reStructuredText (rst.el) as shipped by docutils 0.5 and
0.6 that allows a local user to perform a symlink attack to overwrite
arbitrary files.

Could a CVE be assigned for this issue?

Thanks in advance.
