The "Fixed a initialization order remark by Serg" fix,  problem pointed
out in your comment dated as "[14 Jul 15:53] Sergei Golubchik".

As when you use full path for --datadir, it's correctly expanded using
realpath.  Relative paths starting with '.' are expected to be resolved
from CWD.  I've not checked path starting with '~', they may be
affected by this problem too.

Thank you for clarifications / confirmations!
