These were previously discussed in <hccd44$uli$1@....gmane.org>.  I discussed 
them off list with the Redhat folks.  I can forward our off list discussions 
which include details of our original URLs.  The only reason the advisories 
haven't been forwarded to the normal lists is that the person responsible for 
managing them has been otherwise engaged this last month and we were aware of 
the oCERT agregate advisory.
