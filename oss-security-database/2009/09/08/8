Subject: CVE Request - glib symlink copying permission exposure

Hi,

I'd like to request a CVE for an issue where glib causes symlink targets
to gain 0777 permissions when any symlink pointing at the target is
copied.  There is no privilege escalation, but it can lead to situations
where other users on a system could have read/write access to important
files (e.g. .ssh/id_rsa).

Thanks,

-Kees
