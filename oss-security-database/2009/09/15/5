FYI: These issues also affect the Horde Groupware Edition and Horde
Groupware Webmail Edition.

Secunia has a dedicated advisory, SA369729 [1] for these. It mentions
that the two editions are only affected by the two XSS issues. This is
in accordance with upstream's release announcements.

However, the 1.2.4 release of both editions seem to be missing in that
advisory, both are vulnerable to all three issues, including the file
overwrite, according to the release announcements [2, 3].
