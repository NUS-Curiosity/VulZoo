This one is here in 2.4 :

in 2.4, was fixed with the other one above from 2005 (0f3f23).

OK, for 2.4, all the issues mentionned here were fixed in 2.4.37.6 and present
up to 2.4.37.5.

In 2.6 now :

  - tc_fill_tclass was fixed in 2.6.31-rc9 (commit 16ebb5e0)
  - neightbl_fill_info, tcf_fill_node, tc_fill_qdisc... in 2.6.13-rc1
    (commit 9ef1d4c7)

OK, thanks Steven.
