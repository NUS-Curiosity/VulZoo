Vulnerabilities as this, but only for some proprietary product, are leading
some security scanners like nessus, but not only,  to signal vulnerability
for LDAP bind null, LDAP null base SEARCH and so. For this many LDAP
administrators are forced by their security deparment,who are ignorant of
these details but follow what they say the tools without understanding the
implications, to configure their LDAP server by disabling the anonymous bind
in general, also to the LDAP root DSE. But this is in direct violation of
RFC LDAP and subsequently causing a large quantity of issues with other
products that follow the RFC.

Free to ask if you want more details.
