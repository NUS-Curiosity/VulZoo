Subject: Re: OpenOffice.org CVE-2009-2139


Hi,
there was a thread about it on vendor-sec some month ago.

Here are the two descriptions from Petr:

CVE-2009-2139

Manipulated EMF files can lead to heap overflows and arbitrary code
execution

    * Synopsis: Manipulated EMF files can lead to heap overflows and
                arbitrary code execution
    * State: Resolved

1. Impact

A security vulnerability with the way OpenOffice/Go-oo 2.x and 3.x process EMF
files may allow a remote unprivileged user who provides an OpenOffice.org/Go-oo
document that is opened by a local user to execute arbitrary commands on the
system with the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org/Go-oo. No working
exploit is known right now.

2. Affected releases

The problem was introduced in OpenOffice.org release, based on ooo-build (Go-oo),
version 2.1. It was fixed in the version 3.0.1. The original OpenOffice.org
builds, available from http://www.openoffice.org/, were not affected.

3. Symptoms

There are no predictable symptoms that would indicate this issue has occurred

4. Relief/Workaround

There is no workaround. See "Resolution" below.

5. Resolution

This issue is addressed in the following release:

OpenOffice.org, based on ooo-build (Go-oo), version 3.0.1

Note: The original OpenOffice.org builds, available from http://www.openoffice.org/,
were newer affected by this vulnerability.

6. Comments

The issue is similar to CVE-2008-2238. The ooo-build-specific variant was found and fixed by ooo-build (Go-oo) developers.


And:
CVE-2009-2140

Manipulated EMF+ files can lead to heap overflows and arbitrary code
execution

    * Synopsis: Manipulated EMF+ files can lead to heap overflows and
                arbitrary code execution
    * State: Resolved

1. Impact

A security vulnerability with the way OpenOffice/Go-oo 2.x and 3.x
process EMF+ files may allow a remote unprivileged user who provides an
OpenOffice.org/Go-oo document that is opened by a local user to execute
arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the user running
OpenOffice.org/Go-oo. No working exploit is known right now.


2. Affected releases

The problem was introduced in OpenOffice.org release, based on ooo-build
(Go-oo), version 2.3.1. It was fixed in the version 3.0.1. Only the builds
supporting EMF+ import (applying EMFPlus patchset) were affected. The
original OpenOffice.org builds, available from http://www.openoffice.org/,
were newer affected.


3. Symptoms

There are no predictable symptoms that would indicate this issue has occurred


4. Relief/Workaround
