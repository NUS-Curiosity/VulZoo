Looks like this actually got split to two after all...

CVE-2009-3051:
Multiple format string vulnerabilities in
lib/silcclient/client_entry.c in Secure Internet Live Conferencing
(SILC) Toolkit before 1.1.10, and SILC Client before 1.1.8, allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string
specifiers in a nickname field, related to the (1)
silc_client_add_client, (2) silc_client_update_client, and (3)
silc_client_nickname_format functions.

Which corresponds to this commit:
http://git.silcnet.org/gitweb/?p=silc.git;a=commitdiff;h=1598b3a51b51a434037461ccd35487bc0df3137c


CVE-2009-3163:
Multiple format string vulnerabilities in lib/silcclient/command.c in
Secure Internet Live Conferencing (SILC) Toolkit before 1.1.10, and
SILC Client 1.1.8 and earlier, allow remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via format string specifiers in a channel name, related
to (1) silc_client_command_topic, (2) silc_client_command_kick, (3)
silc_client_command_leave, and (4) silc_client_command_users.

Which corresponds to (the second part of) this commit:
http://git.silcnet.org/gitweb/?p=silc.git;a=commitdiff;h=8cb801cf6482666818e721822ce81c81ec818908


Btw, SILC seems to implement own snprintf function, that is not only
wrapper around system snprintf, so glibc hardening may not help here
(I've not tried to confirm that with real PoC though).
