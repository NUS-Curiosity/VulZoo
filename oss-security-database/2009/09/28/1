Subject: CVE request: oping allows the disclosure of arbitrary file contents

  oping is setuid root application and one of the command line arguments allows
 a configuration file to be specified.  This file is read and *reported*
 to the console - Unless the file is lucky enough to look like a list
 of hostnames.

  Brief details here:
