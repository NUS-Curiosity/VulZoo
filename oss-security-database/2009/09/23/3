Subject: Three Shibboleth issues

1)

| The Shibboleth software includes code to encode and decode URL
| information, and has been shown to crash on certain malformed
| encoded URLs due to a buffer overrun.

(Also potential pre-auth code execution.)

2)

NUL injection in certificate names:

3)

| The Shibboleth software supports the use of SAML metadata to
| identify authentication and encryption keys by means of the
| <KeyDescriptor> element. In previous versions, the software
| was improperly ignoring the "use" attribute and treating all
| elements as valid for both signing/TLS and encryption.

Isolated patches are available here:

Be careful when applying them---one hunk touches an inline function in
a header-only C++ class with virtual functions (see the mailing list
discussion).
