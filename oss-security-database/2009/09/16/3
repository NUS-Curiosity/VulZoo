Subject: CVE id request: changetrack

Hi,
there is an insecure use of file names in changetrack, a 
service that checks the filesystem for changes. It is 
possible to execute arbitrary commands as root via this bug.
Looking at the code this seems to happen as the filename is 
passed to a system call to track the changes with an rcs.

Details here: http://bugs.debian.org/546791

Can I please get a CVE id for this issue?

Cheers
Nico
