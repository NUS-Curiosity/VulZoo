How do you know that the crash you found is the one that's in VulnDisco?
Maybe there are two distinct crashes.  (These types of vague disclosures
can be a real duplicate headache for us in CVE... but neither do we want
to say that a commercial 0day has been fixed when it hasn't).

CVE-2009-3111 below is anchored exclusively on the FreeRADIUS patch for
the CVE-2003-0967 regression.  If there's high confidence that this is the
same as the intevydis.com disclosure, then I'll integrate it into the
description/references.

Reference: URL:https://lists.freeradius.org/pipermail/freeradius-users/2009-September/msg00242.html
Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20090909 CVE Request -- FreeRADIUS 1.1.8
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/09/09/1
Reference: CONFIRM:http://github.com/alandekok/freeradius-server/commit/860cad9e02ba344edb0038419e415fe05a9a01f4

The rad_decode function in FreeRADIUS before 1.1.8 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (radiusd crash) via zero-length
Tunnel-Password attributes.  NOTE: this is a regression error related
to CVE-2003-0967.
