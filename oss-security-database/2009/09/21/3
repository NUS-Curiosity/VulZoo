We recently created CVE-2009-3239 to address an OpenOffice overflow in
enhwmf.cxx/emfplus.cxx, as described in SUSE-SR:2009:015:

  "This update of OpenOffice.org fixes potential buffer overflow in EMF
   parser code (enhwmf.cxx, emfplus.cxx)."

http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2009-09/msg00001.html

Is CVE-2009-3239 a duplicate of CVE-2009-2139?

(If so, we would probably keep CVE-2009-2139 and remove CVE-2009-3239.)
