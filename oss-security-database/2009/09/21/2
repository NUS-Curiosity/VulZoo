Subject: CVE request: kernel: issue with O_EXCL creates on NFSv4

There is an issue with O_EXCL creates on NFSv4 that with enough 
attempts, it is possible for a lingering file from a failed create that 
is world-writable but only setuid execute as the user who is attempting 
these creates. Fortunately, root is not susceptible to this bug, so a 
setuid root file should not be possible. It might be possible to exploit 
this to gain access as another user though.
