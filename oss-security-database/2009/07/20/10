Subject: squid DoS in external auth header parser

I noticed this on Debian's bts [1] and also on upstream's bugzilla [2]
but no CVE has been assigned (not sure if one has been requested or not,
but I've not seen a request come through here).

By the initial looks of things, it seems to be a fairly low severity
issue and may not be easy to duplicate/trigger.  The reporter didn't really
provide much in the way of a reproducer or relevant configs (and the
reference to zope auths makes me not even want to touch it).

Has anyone taken a look at this or has a CVE been requested for it?
Upstream has done nothing with this despite it being reported two weeks
ago.
