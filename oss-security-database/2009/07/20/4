Oh, understood.  I did not think that way, because mmap_min_addr is
implemented in recent 2.4 kernels, which are sort of "older", and it is
also implemented in RHEL-5'ish OpenVZ kernels that we actually use.
(BTW, I'd be happy to share the mmap_min_addr back-port patch to
RHEL-5'ish kernels with Red Hat if there's any interest.)

I am going to release 2.4.37.3-ow1 with a CVE-2009-1895 fix in it, and I
expect it to get into 2.4.37.4.  It's not important for systems with
"sane" userlands (no crappy SUID-root programs), though.
