It was a default RHEL 5.3 SELinux policy.  The same vulnerability from
the policy exists in Fedora 10 and 11.  I haven't tested anything else,
but I imagine lots more are vulnerable (and it doesn't matter what 
kernel you're running).  There will be a CVE for this vulnerability as 
well.

(Really there should have been a CVE for the lack of 
-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks instead of pretending the only problem 
was /dev/net/tun.  As the commit to add it showed (and at least 10 other 
commits to the kernel this weekend) lots of other code was affected, so 
someone not applying a fix for a CVE mentioning only /dev/net/tun 
because they don't have the code for /dev/net/tun compiled in, is going 
to be missing out on a number of fixes).
