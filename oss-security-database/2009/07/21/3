Subject: CVE Request -- RubyGems

Hello Steve, vendors,

  a potential system integrity violation flaw
was found in the way RubyGems used to handle
it's external Gem archives. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted Gem (POSIX tar)
archive, which once opened by an unsuspecting
user, would overwrite relevant system file.
