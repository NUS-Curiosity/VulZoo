Hello Solar Designer,
 I am not sure yet if this works on Apache 2.2.11 which is the latest release. I have tried
and reproduced it on some earlier versions (e.g Apache 2.2.2). Thus I wouldn't really mark
it as that critical yet, since up-to-date servers might not really be vulnerable. Right now only
unpatched older versions (which have also other vulnerabilities anyway, according to the Apache 2.2
Changelog) probably do have a problem. However, this problem wasn't mentioned in the Changelong so
if it indeed doesn't apply to the latest versions (which is yet to be defined),
it might have been fixed "accidentally".

All in all, for now I wouldn't really make that much of an issue about it and I don't think that
the vendors need to hold off releasing anything if they have to. Anyway, I had already mentioned
it in the lists some days earlier and for some reason that didn't attract any attention (perhaps because
I didn't use the word 0day there): http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0305.html

I am in the process of further investigating the issue, however.
Let me know how this goes.
Regards,
ithilgore
