Subject: Apache 2.2 HTTP Basic Auth bypass

Hi,

This is sort of an advance heads-up.  ithilgore, an Nmap developer,
CC'ed on this posting, mentioned on the nmap-dev mailing list (public)
earlier today that he discovered an Apache HTTP Basic Auth bypass
vulnerability, which is yet to be fully researched and reported.

ithilgore - I understand that you might have wanted to have a bit more
time to play with this on your own, but you posted to a public list,
which is why I consider it appropriate to post this to oss-security
"without your consent" to let the distro vendors "prepare" (e.g., hold
off on releasing update packages fixing some minor issues in
anticipation of needing to add a critical fix in a matter of days - just
to provide an example of how such advance notification can be of use).
Of course, the Apache security team is represented on this list, too, so
you might receive questions off-list, I guess. ;-)

Alexander
