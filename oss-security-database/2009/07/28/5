Subject: debian bug report on bind9 DoS

There's a bind 9 DoS reported in Debian's BTS [1] that provides a
reproducer and some interesting info on a bind9 crash.  I don't think
it's a huge problem with a well-secured bind9 configuration, but could
be quite problematic for bind config's that allow updates without an
RNDC key (typical of some dynamic DNS implementations), or on a system
that has lax enough permissions that the RNDC key is exposed.

We don't ship bind 8 so I cannot say whether or not it only affects bind
9 or earlier versions.  Some further information is in our bugzilla from
some quick testing I did [2].

This probably requires a CVE name.
