Good, looks better.

Plus one extraneous version change ;).  Description for -5516 is
supposed to say "before 1.5.5" (as 1.5.5.0, but upstream does not seem
to use trailing ".0"s in version strings) (I have not looked whether
only 1.5.x were affected by this, this may possibly go back to older
versions), one for -5517 should say "before 1.5.6".  Version difference
was the reason for split / assignment of 2 CVEs.

Paragraph above should explain this.  Additionally, they probably just
bumped to upstream version that has all three (-5516, -5517, and -5916)
issues fixed.  Not sure what was their previous version though.
