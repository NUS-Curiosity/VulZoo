Nerver mind, Novell used CVE-2008-5517 for this.  Here's our bug
summary (the CVE description is somewhat misleading, I think):

| Local users with write access to the configuration of a Git repository
| served by gitweb could cause gitweb to execute arbitrary shell commands
| with the permission of the web server (CVE-2008-5517).

In DSA-1708-1, we use CVE-2008-5516 for these issues:

  http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git?a=commitdiff;h=516381d5
  http://repo.or.cz/w/git.git?a=commitdiff;h=c582abae

These have been fixed silently quite some time ago (in 1.5.6 and
1.5.5, respectively).

(For editorial reasons, the changelog in our DSA contains the previous
CVE assignment.)
