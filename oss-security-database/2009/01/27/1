This doesn't seem to have any security implications; it's a single null 
byte overflow that happens all the time (not under control of an 
attacker), and from looking at the function that null byte isn't going to 
overwrite anything that would lead to a security consequence.

So it looks to me like a bug, no CVE.

Thanks, Mark
