Subject: CVE Request: MoinMoin

I just now noticed this in the public MoinMoin mercurial commits:
Fixed XSS issue in antispam

The commit is:
http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.7/rev/89b91bf87dad

I haven't tried to reproduce it or anything, but the fix was simply to
perform wikiutil.escape(match.group()), so it seems valid.
