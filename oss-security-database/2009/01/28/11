Subject: CVE id request: php5

Hi

I don't think this has a CVE id yet.

Quote from the debian bugreport:
"When an invalid key is used when calling dba_replace on a dba inifile 
resource it leads to file truncation."

References:
Debian Bugreport: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=507101
Security Reason: http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/58
Upstream patch:
http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/dba/libinifile/inifile.c?r1=1.14.2.1.2.4&r2=1.14.2.1.2.5

Could I please get a CVE id for this?

Cheers
Steffen
