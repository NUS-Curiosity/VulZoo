We don't have any formal criteria for this kind of thing, but in general,
we ask whether there are realistic scenarios under which an attack can
succeed, and if any additional privileges are gained versus normal
methods.  These questions are particularly applicable to language
interpreters and compilers.  Given this scenario, it seems unrealistic
that an app would perform a dba_replace() with user-controlled input - and
if it does, then it's a vuln in the application, not PHP itself.  So it
doesn't seem to require a CVE.
