Subject: clarification on CVE-2008-5687 (mediawiki)

Hi,

the CVE id descriptions says:
"MediaWiki 1.11 through 1.13.3 does not properly protect..." 
while the referenced upstream announce announces 1.13.3 as a 
security update for 1.13.2. So it doesn't look like 1.13.3 
is affected.

Also looking at the patch it turns out that 1.13.3 is fixing 
this by adding an htaccess file.

The CVE id description should get an update.

Cheers
Nico
