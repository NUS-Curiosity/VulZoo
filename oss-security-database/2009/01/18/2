Subject: CVE request: WebSVN

WebSVN 2.0 does not properly implement access control checks, allowing
authenticated users to access files with known paths.

(This is fixed in version 2.1.  I think this feature was only included
in the 1.7 betas, and no released 1.x version before that.  Relevant
fixes are probably in r635, r636, r649.)
