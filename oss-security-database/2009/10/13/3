I believe that the following got assigned for these independently of
this request:

CVE-2009-3692
Unspecified vulnerability in the VBoxNetAdpCtl configuration tool in
Sun VirtualBox 3.0.x before 3.0.8 on Solaris x86, Linux, and Mac OS X
allows local users to gain privileges via unknown vectors.

I know this does not satisfy your request, it's rather a heads-up to
avoid duplicate assignment.
