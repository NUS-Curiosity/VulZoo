Subject: CVE request for oCERT advisory 2009-013 (yTNEF/Evolution TNEF)

I'm not sure if a CVE name has been requested for this issue; I can't
see one anywhere.

http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2009-013.html

It's for the Evolution TNEF/yTNEF issues disclosed early last month.
Could we have a CVE name assigned for this?

Thanks.
