I've responded to Tomas off list regarding these issues since our advisories 
have not yet been made available.  We have 4 advisories to cover the 
individual flaws.  If anyone else wants further details in the meantime, feel 
free to get in touch off list but I'll likely only respond to people I can 
validate (i.e. package maintainers for the distros etc).
