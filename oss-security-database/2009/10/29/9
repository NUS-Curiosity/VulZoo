We've got a rather strict backported-security-fixes-only policy
because we've got a very interdependent code base, so we usually can't
switch upstream versions for libraries because most developers have a
rather lax attitude towards ABI compatibility (and even if they don't,
we're usually trailing behind a major version or two 8-/).
