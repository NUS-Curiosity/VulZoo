Subject: Mutt 1.5.19 SSL chain verification flaw

Hi!

Mutt version 1.5.19 introduced a support for intermediate CA certs,
available when mutt is linked against both OpenSSL and GnuTLS, added
via upstream commits:

http://dev.mutt.org/trac/changeset/5621:5db868a874b6/mutt_ssl.c
http://dev.mutt.org/trac/changeset/5623:7d0583e0315d/mutt_ssl_gnutls.c

Miroslav Lichvar noticed that a certificate chain validation was not
implemented properly.  Individual certificates in the chain where
checked and accepted, but the chain as a whole as not validated
properly.

Issue was addressed via following upstream patches:

http://dev.mutt.org/trac/changeset?new=5870:dc9ec900c657@mutt_ssl.c&old=5699:1238dff54a15@mutt_ssl.c
http://dev.mutt.org/trac/changeset?new=5853:0b13183e40e0@mutt_ssl_gnutls.c&old=5699:1238dff54a15@mutt_ssl_gnutls.c

CVE-2009-1390 was assigned to this issue.
