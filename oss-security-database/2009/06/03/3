Subject: CVE request: kernel: sparc64: Fix crash with /proc/iomem

This was introduced in commit 9fd8b647 (v2.6.22-rc1), and fixed in
commit 192d7a46. The description is as follows:

From: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@...hat.com>

[ Upstream commit 67c6d11d1a174ec4cad9a3c5d5f9043c ]

When you compile kernel on Sparc64 with heap memory checking and type
"cat /proc/iomem", you get a crash, because pointers in struct
resource are uninitialized.

Most code fills struct resource with zeros, so I assume that it is
responsibility of the caller of request_resource to initialized it,
not the responsibility of request_resource functuion.

After 2.6.29 is out, there could be a check for uninitialized fields
added to request_resource to avoid crashes like this.
