It is correct to say that installations of current releases of Apache 
httpd - versions <= 2.0.63 and <= 2.2.11 - which are built using the 
bundled copy of APR-util, may be affected by the three APR-util issues, 
depending on the configuration and set of modules used.  Note that 
Apache httpd 2.x can also be built using standalone installations of APR 
and APR-util.

We're not aware of any way to trigger CVE-2009-0023 remotely using the 
set of modules included in httpd itself.  It may be possible to trigger 
both CVE-2009-1956 and CVE-2009-1955 if mod_dav is configured.
