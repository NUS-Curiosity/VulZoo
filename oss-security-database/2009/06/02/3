Hi,

Orange Labs IKEv2 fuzzer discovers two DoS vulnerabilities
----------------------------------------------------------

Two DoS vulnerabilities in the charon daemon were discovered by
fuzzing techniques:

1) Receiving a malformed IKE_SA_INIT request leaves an incomplete state
   which causes a crash of the IKEv2 charon daemon while dereferencing
   a null pointer if a subsequent CREATE_CHILD_SA request for the
   same connection is received.

2) Receiving an IKE_AUTH request with either a missing TSi or TSr
   traffic selector payload causes a crash of the IKEv2 charon daemon
   because the null pointer checks for TSi and TSr prior to deletion
   were swapped by mistake.

The IKEv2 fuzzer used was developed by the Orange Labs vulnerability
research team. The tool was initially written by Gabriel Campana and
is now maintained by Laurent Butti.

All strongSwan versions from 4.1.0 up to 4.3.0 are affected. Either
apply the two security patches

http://download.strongswan.org/patches/03_invalid_ike_state_patch/

http://download.strongswan.org/patches/04_swapped_ts_check_patch/

or upgrade to strongSwan 4.3.1 or 4.2.15.
