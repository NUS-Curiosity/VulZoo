You saw that a new comment was posted to [3] that points to an earlier
bug and a different patch, right?  Looks like it was just updated today,
to point to this bug report from january:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1985

Also, that report seems to agree with your quick analysis:

"However, the previous patch does appear to prevent a payload of more than one distinct byte,
making this effectively useless as a code injection vector. Nonetheless, it
still is effective at crashing applications that use LibTIFF."

In fact, I think the reporter of that bug was one of the writers in the
lan.st forum notes you're showing, particularly based on this comment
where he indicates it isn't exploitable and that he filed a bug:
