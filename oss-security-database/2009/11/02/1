Subject: CVE request: kernel: connector security bypass

1/ uvesafb/connector: Disallow unprivileged users to send netlink packets
upstream commit: cc44578b5a508889beb8ae3ccd4d2bbdf17bc86c
introduced in v2.6.24-rc1; fixed in v2.6.32-rc3

2/ pohmelfs/connector: Disallow unprivileged users to configure pohmelfs
upstream commit: 98a5783af02f4c9b87b676d7bbda6258045cfc76
(staging/experimental)

3/ dst/connector: Disallow unprivileged users to configure dst
upstream commit: 5788c56891cfb310e419c4f9ae20427851797431
(staging/experimental)

4/ dm/connector: Only process connector packages from privileged processes
upstream commit: 24836479a126e02be691e073c2b6cad7e7ab836a
introduced in v2.6.31-rc1; fixed in v2.6.32-rc3

2/ and 3/ are experimental; I doubt distros are supporting these.
1/ and 4/ fixed similar issues, so perhaps we should just have one CVE 
name for this.
