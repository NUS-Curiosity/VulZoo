Subject: X server umask issue

Hi everyone,

I'm looking for a second opinion, and wondering if anyone has some extra insight
into this Debian bug:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=555308

It seems that the suid X server inherits the users umask, and if you have a umask
of 0, the X log file will end up being world writable. This is obviously a very
silly thing to do anyhow, so I question if that's a security flaw itself. It is a
bug that should probably be fixed I'd say.

What I am wondering though, are there other files the X server creates that could
be an issue for this? I'm not aware of any, but I'm also not an expert by any
stretch of the imagination. Am I missing something else?

Thanks.
