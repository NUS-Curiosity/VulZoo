This says:

  2009-09-29 Version 1.3.3 is available. The new release fixes a serious
  security issue in oping: If the application is installed with the
  SetUID-bit, anybody on the system could use oping to read arbitrary
  files using the "-f" option.

So as stated, this sounds worthy of a CVE to me.  Thoughts?
