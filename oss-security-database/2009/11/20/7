Bogdan Calin disclosed the details about that vulnerability on full-disclosure 
mailing list. He didn't disclosed his script but I wrote a PoC that works like 
a charm. It makes DoS possible for any server that runs PHP within 1 minute 
with a few requests.

Additionally, this vulnerability affects 5.2.11. I guess all products before 
PHP 5.3.1 are vulnerable.

I think this deserves CVE Id. Any ideas?
