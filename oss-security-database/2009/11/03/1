Subject: CVE-2009-3547 kernel: fs: pipe.c null pointer dereference

* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in each of the following
functions in the Linux kernel: pipe_read_open(), pipe_write_open(), and
pipe_rdwr_open(). When the mutex lock is not held, the i_pipe pointer 
could be released by other processes before it is used to update the 
pipe's reader and writer counters. This could lead to a local denial of 
service or privilege escalation.
