Subject: CVE request: kernel: KVM: x86 emulator: limit instructions to 15
 bytes

Quoting from the patch: "While we are never normally passed an 
instruction that exceeds 15 bytes, smp games can cause us to attempt to 
interpret one, which will cause large latencies in non-preempt hosts."

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/avi/kvm.git;a=commitdiff;h=e42d9b8141d1f54ff72ad3850bb110c95a5f3b88
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=541160

I understand that a malicious guest can cause long scheduling latencies 
in the host, resulting in a denial of service, but I have not 
investigated this further to determine if it has more severe consequences.

Thanks, Eugene
