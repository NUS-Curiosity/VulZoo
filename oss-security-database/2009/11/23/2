This bug was fixed in 0.8.17 and 0.7.63:

Changes with nginx 0.8.17                                        28 Sep 2009

    *) Security: now "/../" are disabled in "Destination" request header
       line.

Changes with nginx 0.7.63                                        26 Oct 2009

    *) Security: now "/../" are disabled in "Destination" request header
