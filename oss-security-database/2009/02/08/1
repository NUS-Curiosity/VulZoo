Subject: CVE-2008-6049 is bogus

Hi,
"SQL injection vulnerability in index.php in TinyMCE 2.0.1 
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands 
via the menuID parameter."

I just checked this issue. As far as I can tell tinymce does 
not ship any php code so something seems fishy with that. 
2.0.1 did also not ship php code:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/tinymce/tinymce_2_0_1.zip?download


Cheers
Nico
