	information disclosure)

Robert,

  thanks for the correction!

Today also found out, the net-snmp-5.3.2.2 version, as shipped
with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is not vulnerable to this
issue (due some RH specific internal patch applied in between,
which mitigates the impact of the flaw). So other vendors,
please perform your own investigation, if particular version
of net-snmp you ship is (isn't) affected.

Also checked state of ucd-snmp-4.2.5 (not sure if someone
else ship it yet), this looks NOT to be affected to this
flaw.

Regards, Jan.
