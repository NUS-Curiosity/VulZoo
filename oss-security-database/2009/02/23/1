Subject: CVE request: mldonkey arbitrary file download vulnerability

mldonkey in version 2.9.7 and earlier permits remote attackers to
download arbitrary files accessible to the mldonkey daemon, using
crafted requests to the HTTP console.

(The proposed patch deals with this in a rather odd place.)
