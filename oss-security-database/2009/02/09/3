Subject: local list archive

Hi,

I've slightly enhanced the software behind the local archive of
oss-security at http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/ over the
weekend - now most URLs in message bodies are turned into hyperlinks
(with rel="nofollow" to reduce the added incentive for spam), and also
the CC header is displayed (previously, only Date/From/To/Subject were
displayed).

If anyone is curious, the code may be reviewed at
http://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists

Correctly detected hyperlinks may be seen in my previous posting at
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2009/02/09/2 and in many
others.

Indeed, these archives are still lacking several essential features;
this is to be worked on.

Alexander
