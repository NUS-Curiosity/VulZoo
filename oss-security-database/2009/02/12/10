BTW that BID list of affected kernels isn't correct; the multibyte stuff 
wasn't in <=2.6.18 at least.

I didn't check exactly where since it doesn't affect RHEL and didn't look 
into the issue any further -- but on first glance it seemed like you'd 
have to be a console user and display/select some carefully chosen 
characters in order to do the overflow; so it's probably a 'local attacker 
at keyboard' flaw?

Cheers, Mark
