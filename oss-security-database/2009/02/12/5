A specific version wasn't listed and the new maintainer hasn't released
any new versions, so I'm assuming the last version under the previous
maintainer, which seems to be 2.0.1.

Pinguar, sorry for the delay.

Buffer overflow in the PyCrypto ARC2 module 2.0.1 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary
code via a large ARC2 key length.
