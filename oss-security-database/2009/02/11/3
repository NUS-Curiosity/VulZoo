Thanks, TJ.  I just read the comments and the duplicate note a few
minutes ago and was going to reply to it.

We still need a CVE name, however.  Bug #3124 does not note any kind of
security impact, which there clearly is, so I don't believe a CVE name
had been assigned to this previously (at least not that I could find).
