We don't have a CVE for the fact that strcpy() exists - it can be used
safely even though it's dangerous.  My interpretation of this issue was
the same, so no CVE is needed.  Any PHP application that misuses
mb_ereg_replace(), however, is fair game.

(We already have a handful of CVEs for executable regexp's in PHP apps)
