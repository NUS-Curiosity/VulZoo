The string conversion code in the CIFS module handling was rewritten
to be able to handle destination buffer sizes.

Its basically starting with this commit:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=7fabf0c9479fef9fdb9528a5fbdb1cb744a744a4
and then conversions of the code to it.

I am however not sure of how much needs to be backported, I guess only
the stuff already with CVE entries.

Ciao, Marcus
