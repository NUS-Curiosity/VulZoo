Debian collects information on all kernel security issues in a public
SVN repo. It contains information on fixed versions, upstream
commits and external information sources (e.g. other distribution bug
trackers). It might be useful to you:
http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/kernel-sec
You can also subscribe to the SVN commit mailing list to get instant
updates.

However, writing verbose advisories on all kernel security issues would
be an Herculean task; we currently track 484 kernel security issues
in the kernel-sec tracker...
