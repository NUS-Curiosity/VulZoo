Subject: CVE id request: nsd

Hi,
the nsd name server seems to have an off-by-one which at 
least opens it up for denial of service. The advisory states 
that code execution is highly unlikely in this case though I 
had no time to check this.

Patches:

http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/nsd/nsd-2.3.7-vuln.patch

Can I get a CVE id for this please?

Cheers
Nico
