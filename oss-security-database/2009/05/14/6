Subject: CVE Request for libsndfile

From http://www.mega-nerd.com/erikd/Blog/CodeHacking/libsndfile/:

  There's a new release of libsndfile available in the usual place. This
  is a security bug fix release which fixes a potential heap overflow in
  VOC files found and reported by Tobias Klein ( http://www.trapkit.de/ )
  and another in the AIFF file parser found by me.

1.0.20 supposedly fixes it, with the author supplying patches back to
1.0.15. Can we get a CVE for this?

Jamie
