Coppermine Foto Gallery suffers from different vulnerabilities.

There is a Local File Inclusion and a Blind SQL Injection working with 
register_globals = On and magic_quotes_gpc = Off
and
a SQL Injection working in case of registration is enabled and a user can 
create/modify albums 
(default setting if registration is enabled) and php.ini regardless
and 
a Blind SQL Injection when is enabled the ecard logging system 
(that is not a default configuration) and php.ini regardless

Let's see how do they work...
