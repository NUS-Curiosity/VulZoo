Sorry for the delay.

A new CVE is not needed. These two issues (the one which was fixed in
expat CVS in June 2008 and the one with the internal copy of expat in
Python) are essentially the same. The issue seems to be first found by
Peter Valchev in June 2008. As Robert mentioned, the issue has been
fixed in expat's CVS in June 2008 but an updated release was not made
for some reason. The issue was also present in the expat bundled with
Python and it was reported to us independent from the original issue
(even though the reason of the crash is the same). CERT-FI reported the
issue to Python in July 2009. Soon after that the issue was reported to
expat maintainers too since initially we did not know that the issue was
already fixed in expat's CVS. Python's patch has been incorporated into
Python 3.1.1 but there is probably more software with an affected
internal copy of expat out there.
