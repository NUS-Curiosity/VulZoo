Subject: CVE request: fetchmail <= 6.3.10 SSL certificate NUL prefix
 verification bypass

Greetings,

fetchmail <= 6.3.10 is susceptible to NUL prefix certificates such as  
www.paypal.com\0.reknowned.site.example.

Is there a global CVE ID to collect this vulnerability that is supposed to  
be reused by applications?

If there is, please let me know.

If there is not, please assign a new CVE Id.

Thanks
