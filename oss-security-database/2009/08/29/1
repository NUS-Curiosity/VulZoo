Subject: Re: CVE request: perl-IO-Socket-SSL certificate hostname compare bug

Hi,

Just to make you able to classify the problem a bit more:
The fix is important but the impact of the problem is in my opinion currently minor,
because
- the feature to help checking the hostname against the certificate is fairly new
- in former times the apps/modules using IO::Socket::SSL had to implement
  the checking by itself (using the appropriate logic, which differs between
  various protocols).
- most did not implement any checking at all or implemented a limited or wrong check
- therefore I added the checks, where the app only has to decide how the check
  has to be done
- most apps/modules don't even do this simple thing yet, so that this buggy
  feature was not used

That means, that it only impacts apps/modules which depend on this feature
and there are only few (or none) of these apps. But it would probably be nice
to add a note to the CVE that apps/modules should start to implement proper 
certificate checking and that it got easier with newer IO::Socket::SSL
versions.

Regards,
Steffen (Maintainer of IO::Socket::SSL)
