Subject: CVE request: mantis

Hello,

Debian recently updated mantis.  The description is:

  It was discovered that the Debian Mantis package, a web based bug
  tracking system, installed the database credentials in a file with
  world-readable permissions onto the local filesystem. This allows
  local users to acquire the credentials used to control the Mantis
  database.

Can we get a CVE id for this? Thanks!

Mike
