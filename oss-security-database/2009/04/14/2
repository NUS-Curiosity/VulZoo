Somehow the wrong changeset URL shows up in CVE-2009-1272's list of
references [1] (the json decode one, instead of the zip thingy):

What shows up:
http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/json/JSON_parser.c?r1=1.1.2.14&r2=1.1.2.15

What should show up instead:
http://cvs.php.net/viewvc.cgi/php-src/ext/zip/php_zip.c?r1=1.1.2.48&r2=1.1.2.49
