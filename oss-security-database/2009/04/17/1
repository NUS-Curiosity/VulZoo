I am still able to reproduce the problem even after applying this
upstream patch (commit d25141a8). I'm still figuring out what other
patches are needed. If you know which ones, do let us know.

The expected behaviour for this is:
# ps -e
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
    1 pts/0    00:00:00 bash <-- this namespace's "init"
   10 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
# /bin/kill -s SIGKILL -1
kill -1: No such process

Take note that you need to be privileged in order to create a new PID
namespace, but to be able to kill other invisible processes outside of
the namespace is a bypass of the intended namespaces isolation.

Thanks, Eugene
