In addition to my original request, can we have one more for this bug:
https://launchpad.net/bugs/356012

"APT does not properly handle expired or revoked key signatures". This
affects apt < 0.7.21.

Basically, if a repository is signed with only a revoked or expired key,
and gpgv reports VALIDSIG, apt considers it to be properly signed. apt
should check for GOODSIG, not VALIDSIG. Patch is in the bug and this is
already fixed in Debian sid and Ubuntu 9.04.
