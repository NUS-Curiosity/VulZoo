Subject: CVE request: kernel: KVM: VMX: Dont allow uninhibited access to EFER
 on i386

According to the upstream commit 16175a79, vmx_set_msr() does not allow
i386 guests to touch EFER but they can do so through the default: label.
If does not check if they set EFER_LME, so they can oops the host. Fix
by having EFER access through the normal channel (which will check for
EFER_LME) even on i386.

This bug was introduced in upstream commit 6aa8b732ca (Dec 10, 2006).
