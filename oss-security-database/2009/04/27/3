I've been thinking about this lately, it's likely a good idea.

I think having an oss-security CNA that is not MITRE would be useful, and
hopefully would alleviate some of the pressure MITRE currently feels. There
would of course be collisions from time to time, but that's likely going to
still cause less pain than the current model provides.

If this idea is appealing to MITRE, we could start working out some of the
details.
