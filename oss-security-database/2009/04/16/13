Subject: CVE-2009-1189: invalid fix for CVE-2008-3834 (dbus)

It came to our attention that a previous security fix for dbus
(CVE-2008-3834) didn't actually fix the security issue in question.

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17803

As a result, we've assigned CVE-2009-1189 to the issue.
