It adds an additional step an attacker needs to take before having root
privileges. Also it is not just about security, it also helps to limit the
impact of non-security bugs. So I would keep the service user, but add
clear language that explains that this isn't a meaningful security boundary
and that this account needs to be considered to have root privileges.
