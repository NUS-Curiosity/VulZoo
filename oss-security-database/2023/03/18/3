Subject: Re: TTY pushback vulnerabilities / TIOCSTI

According to a note from kernel maintenance (https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?h=v6.3-rc2&id=1e641743f055f075ed9a4edd75f1fb1e05669ddc), as of 2008 only Heirloom mailx (a.k.a. nail) used it for ~h interactive header editing.

Best regards,
