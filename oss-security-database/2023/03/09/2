We have not been able to do anything useful on Linux (glibc) yet.

On OpenBSD, what we did works only because this double free is of the
form "free(ptr); many other malloc() and free() calls; free(ptr);".

If it were of the form "free(ptr); no other malloc() or free() call;
free(ptr);" then this double free would be caught immediately by
malloc's security checks.

Hopefully this helps! With best regards,
