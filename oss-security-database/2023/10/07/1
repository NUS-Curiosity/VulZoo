Subject: How can I join the linux-distros mailing list and become a representative?

My firm is one of the largest cloud provider in China and I would like to add our distro name to the website and become a disto representative.
https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros

The reason is that we have our own Linux distribution and we need to receive vulnerabilities notifications to prepare our packages in advance.

How can I do that? Please advise.
