This just seems like a personal opinion projected onto the relevant projects
though. There is nothing preventing you from getting access to patches and
distributing them to relevant package maintainers for preperation under an
embargo.

Evidently there are three atleast 3 community distros already participating on
the linux-distros list, namely Debian, Arch and Gentoo. So while Fedora might
not have any way to distribute patches, please don't infer that this applies to
all community distros.

We do this in Arch Linux, and I've personally handeled several embargos as a
community project.

A relevant piece of information is also the well-written Gentoo Pre-Release
Disclosure Agreement they have with their package maintainers.

Personally my impression of Fedora after trying to pay attention to their
security meetings and general security planning, all of this seems to be
handeled by Red Hat. So Fedora might not have any need to join the Linux distros
list themselves.
