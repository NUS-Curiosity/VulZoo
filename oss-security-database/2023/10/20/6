What about other web browsers running on X11, most notably Chrome and
Chromium?  If the issue is unique to Firefox or at least not universal
across browsers, that's an extra reason for Firefox to make a change.

Or isolate Firefox to its own X server (or at least a separate one from
where you run terminal emulators managing important stuff), like it
happens when you run it in its own VM (or perhaps many instances of it
in many VMs) on Qubes OS.  Indeed this also removes the convenience of
being able to paste stuff from Firefox with middle-click to outside of
its VM - you have to be explicit by using Qubes' Ctrl-Shift-C and
Ctrl-Shift-V - but that's currently the price for having control.  The
remaining security issue is that some JavaScript running in Firefox can
still race you when you do explicitly copy/paste stuff from Firefox.
