Given that we are discussing early disclosure, I am unsure how open source
relates to it.
This is "pre" open-sourcing the code, so all the open source-related things
might not help at all.

I would second the call to "talk to your lawyers," especially when entities
like Huawei are involved.
I am singling out Huawei specifically because it is considered a treat to
US national security and is on the embargo list.
