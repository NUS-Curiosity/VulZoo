Subject: linux-distros membership application of openEuler

Hi,

I'm requesting linux-distros mailing list membership on behalf of
openEuler[1], a Linux distro that's actively maintained since 2020. It is
hosted by OpenAtom Foundation[2] with many forms of support available from
Huawei, Kylin, UnionTech, etc. It is publicly available, free to use and open
to contribution.

Here are the responses to the membership criteria:

> 1. Be an actively maintained Unix-like operating system distro with
>    substantial use of Open Source components
> 2. Have a userbase not limited to your own organization

The distro and its commercial derivatives have more than 4.5 million accumulated
deployments on bare metal (since 2020), and even more if considering public and
private cloud instances. Joining linux-distros will make a real difference for
patching important issues for users.

>    and continuing to present day, of fixing security issues (including
>    some that had been handled on (linux-)distros, meaning that membership
>    would have been relevant to you) and releasing the fixes within 10 days

The distribution has a complete public record of security fixes[3]. Although
there is no defined policy on enforcing release time of security patches
(yet), the actual timeline in execution is 7 days for high impact issues and
14 days for medium ones.

The distribution is not a downstream or a rebuild of another distro. There
are confusions on this question (especially Wikipedia pages) because before
the project existed, there is an internal-only distro named "Euler OS" which
is RHEL-based. When openEuler project is found the distribution is rebuilt and
maintained from scratch, and there are also a few flavors of kernel packages
with different patchsets. There are also a few commercial and/or community
downstream distros of openEuler, too.

openEuler has been actively working on patching upstream issues and there is a
complete tracking and triaging of all issues with a CVE number[4]. The team
is following oss-security's information closely, although weren't actively
participating in discussions.

Yes we accept the list policy and are willing to contribute back in ways we
are able to.

> 8. Be able and willing to handle PGP-encrypted e-mail
> 9. Have someone already on the private list, or at least someone else who

Besides my role at openEuler, I’m also a part of the Debian Security Team,
though I’m not subscribed to linux-distros since there are already people
representing. If this application is accepted, I would like to step up to be
the representative of openEuler.
