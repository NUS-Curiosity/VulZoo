Let's avoid non-essential references to political sentiments here.

Oh, they're well aware of that.  From the Apache Foundation blog post:

https://news.apache.org/foundation/entry/save-open-source-the-impending-tragedy-of-the-cyber-resilience-act

"The current definitions3 are such that the CRA applies to the ASF, all
of its (volunteer) developers, and all our output. And, as the ASF
understands from its meeting with policy makers, this was intentional."

"As the regulation of open source is intentional, and there is also a
lot of common sense, good (open source) practices, in the CRA: the
expectation is that we are past the point where asking for a blanket
exception is productive."

I advise against premature protests by people who haven't even bothered
to read the available material on the topic.
