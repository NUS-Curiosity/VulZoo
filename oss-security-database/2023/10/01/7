We plan¹ to go public with the available fixes (addressing a subset of
the issues) on Monday, Oct 2nd, 12:00 UTC.

By this time we'll provide access the available fixes (based on the
current master), and to an exim-4.96.1 security release.

¹) In case none of the major distributions runs asks us for a delay.

    Best regards from Dresden/Germany
