Right, but we also had an effective mitigation for R9 pushed publicly in
Security SIG on Oct 3, same day as the vulnerability was made public:

https://sig-security.rocky.page/packages/glibc/

This was possible due to explicit permission I requested/obtained from
Qualys in a thread on linux-distros.  The rules do mention that things
like that can be done "with the reporter's explicit approval".  (This
option also came up in the recent discussion around illumos distros.)

Yes, I noticed this one too and asked him about it, and yes it was just
a test that was not shipped.

I would be pushing a Security SIG package addressing the issue for R8 as
well if we didn't get upstream's update for a day more (after Oct 5).

I agree this is something to improve, and I intend to be contributing to
that with my CIQ or Rocky Linux hat on, as well as encourage others with
Rocky Linux to contribute to upstreams more.

I did contribute to the linux-distros discussion on this glibc issue, to
an extent greater than I would have without intent to push a mitigation
or fix into Rocky Linux Security SIG.

Quoting from the above web page:

"CIQ offers an additional paid service for customers: Rocky Linux Long
Term Support ("LTS"). This is designed for organizations who want to
remain on a previous minor release of Rocky Linux (like 8.6), which is
no longer supported by the public project. CIQ staff will continue
backporting security and bug fixes into the supported minor releases for
a period of time, after the public project has retired that minor
release.

Subscribed customers who value stability can remain on their desired
release longer, while still enjoying minor security and bugfix updates
to their packages. As of this writing, CIQ is supporting non-zero,
even-numbered point releases (8.6, 8.8, 9.2, 9.4, etc.) with its LTS
offerings. LTS support lasts for 18 months after the release is retired
from the public project. For example, Rocky 8.6 was retired in November
2022. CIQ's LTS-8.6 support will last 18 months from that, or May 2024."

SIGs are ineligible to join on their own.  A distro's security team that
would only push to SIGs on the coordinated release date can.
