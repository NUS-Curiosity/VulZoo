No.

For 2023-01 I went with our existing procedure and requested an
assignment from MITRE, just as in all prior cases.  I got the automated
acknowledgement (on Thursday 28th Sep, request ID 1532633).  I've yet to
get a CVE assignment.

So for the next one, I tried a new approach.  I filled out the GitHub
Security Advisory flow ahead of release, got a GHSA, and requested a CVE
immediately.  It looks like that was issued the next day.

Going forward, the NATS project will be using GitHub's processes for
requesting a CVE assignment.  Our documented procedures have been
updated.

I'm adjusting our published text format to have known aliases near the
top, to make it easier to cross-reference.  For NATS advisory 2023-01,
this is aka GHSA-fr2g-9hjm-wr23 and GO-2023-2133.
