That's the crux of it but I don't think it frees Firefox from
responsibility. Despite the premise being contrary to common sense and
fifty years of evidence, Firefox promises to sandbox all of the bad
things that untrusted third-party code might do to you.

Are there any other programs that run third-party code by default and
are not considered vulnerabilities?
