It was a very insightful talk. However, I'm not sure whether companies
would even be willing to start a conversation with an open source
community without
an NDA being signed.

Coming from a developing country in Africa, we are building cloud
services in our new data centers for local businesses.
We wish we could offer the same level of security as large cloud
services if the large hardware companies
were willing to open a channel to us despite us being still at the
early stage ...
