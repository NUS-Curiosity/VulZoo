the problem with modification of "clipboard" is unfortunately much broader, than just command execution in the shell. Imagine situation like pasting a bank account number for money transfer into internetbankig web page, and some browser tab in background silently replaces the number. Or replaces the bitcoin address, to make situation more dramatic. The direct command execution is probably the most straight-forward approach, but with bit of a creativity you can come with many various attack scenarios. 

While I agree that application isolation in X11 is a security problem, this bug/feature is bit of a new pokemon, it also breaks tab isolation within a browser itself, when used under X11.
