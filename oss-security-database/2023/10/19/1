Humans have a habit of specifying the most important thing first, not
only in natural language, but also commands. This reflects in
command, e.g. `ls -l *z --color=never`. Forgot something? `!ls
--human-readable`, there, more stuff appended to the end. Nobody
likes to do cursor movement, and nobody likes retyping the command
from the start to meet the POSIX pedantism that requires all options
before the first non-option (operand).

For this reason, POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 is unpopluar, and so would,
unfortunately, be your suggestion to stop option processing at a
wildcard with an implicit "--" (which would become explicit "--" for
the program's argv).

The ./ suggestion has some merit, though this leads to programs
acting differently, e.g. `tar --strip=N` .
