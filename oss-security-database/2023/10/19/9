That observation may be outdated. At least my bash 5.2.15 on Debian
does not execute pasted newlines, it treats it as a multi-line
command and waits for an actual enter keypress (tested inside a few
different terminal emulators including vanilla xterm, so pretty sure
it's not being mitigated at that layer).
