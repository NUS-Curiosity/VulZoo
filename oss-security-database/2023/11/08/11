I'd say it's pretty clear it's confusing, given that non-alpha 
characters have mysterious behaviors in non-human situations, and this 
particular character is probably confusing to humans too, depending on 
how clear/large the font is.  ICVE? 1CV? lCVE?  On the computer side of 
the equation,  I just put  !CVE  into the search bar of my browser. It 
didn't even bring up a page of results, it just sent me directly to:

https://cve.mitre.org/

Don't do this.
