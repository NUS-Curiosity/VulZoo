Subject: CVE-2023-46851: Apache Allura: sensitive information exposure via
 import

Severity: critical

Affected versions:

- Apache Allura 1.0.1 through 1.15.0

Description:

Allura Discussion and Allura Forum importing does not restrict URL values 
specified in attachments. Project administrators can run these imports, which 
could cause Allura to read local files and expose them.  Exposing internal files 
then can lead to other exploits, like session hijacking, or remote code execution.

This issue affects Apache Allura from 1.0.1 through 1.15.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.16.0, which fixes the issue.  If 
you are unable to upgrade, set "disable_entry_points.allura.importers = 
forge-tracker, forge-discussion" in your .ini config file.
