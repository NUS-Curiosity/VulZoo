So <3.2.1 is affected, but also =3.2.1, and "[FIXED_VERSION]" was
seemingly not replaced in the template. What are the correct affected
and unaffected versions? I tried to dig into what releases the fix
commit is in, but I found that that commit doesn't seem to be in any
tags yet, either?

~/git/dolphinscheduler $ git tag --contains 7308888c703fbe227887d2426273100582096134
~/git/dolphinscheduler $
