Subject: Re: !CVE: A new platform to track security issues not
 acknowledged by vendors

Hello all,

Thank you for your valuable feedback! We are always open to hear from 
the community and happy to improve for the benefit of all of us.

We agree with Alexander on the exclamation mark issue, it can be tedious 
when searching in the mailing lists and other sites. Also with David 
that when possible it would be good to clearly distinct names even when 
it's not legally required.

For those reasons, the !CVE team agreed to make the identifier more 
distinctive. The IDs are now NotCVE-YYYY-XXX and they are completely 
aligned to the notcve website name. So if someone is searching for 
NotCVE in the mailing list, Google, etc, will find what they are looking 
for.

Those updates are already applied and because some sites have included 
the https://notcve.org/view.php?id=!CVE-2023-0001 link (@notCVE at X, 
etc.) we are automatically redirecting only that URL to the new one 
https://notcve.org/view.php?id=NotCVE-2023-0001

Thank you all again for your feedback!

Kind regards,
!CVE Team
