Apologies, I may have misremembered exactly what I supposed to be doing at some
point, and in hindsight, much of what I have done was closer to #6 than #1:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/25/15
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/12/2
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/01/31/7

but I at least did some of #1 if you look far enough back:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/08/09/1

I've also tried to set a good example in the messages I post on behalf of X.Org.

I'd be happy to pass on #1 to someone else and continue doing #3.  I don't have
the bandwidth to write tools to automate it though (#4) - I mostly monitor
chatter on twitter & mastodon, watch the newly published CVE list, and monitor
updates to https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker.git.
