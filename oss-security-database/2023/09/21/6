A linux-distros member pointed out to me off-list that the above sounded
like I'm against CPU microarchitectural issues being reported to distros
at all.  This is not the case.  There is in fact a way to report such
issues to the distros list now and stay within the current policies -
simply bring them to there when a coordinated disclosure date is already
finalized and it's in e.g. just 7 days.  In such cases, also microcode
fixes and/or proposed OS-level workarounds are likely to already exist.

For example, Tavis brought Zenbleed to the distros list 2 days before
its public disclosure here:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/24/1

and this little heads-up, even if over a weekend, was appreciated.

I think e.g. 7 days (anything up to 14, if the CRD is certain and final)
will work even better.
