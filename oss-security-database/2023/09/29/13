Subject: 3 buffer overflows in gstreamer's gst-plugins-bad before 1.22.6

https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/security/sa-2023-0006.html reports:

    Security Advisory 2023-0006 (ZDI-CAN-21660) (CVE-2023-40474)

    Details:
    Heap-based buffer overflow in the MXF file demuxer when handling malformed
    files with uncompressed video in GStreamer versions before 1.22.6.

    Impact:
    It is possible for a malicious third party to trigger a crash in the
    application, and possibly also effect code execution through heap
    manipulation.

    Solution:
    The gst-plugins-bad 1.22.6 releases address the issue. People using older
    branches of GStreamer should apply the patch and recompile.

    Patches:
    https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/5362.patch
    (includes patch for SA-2023-0007 / ZDI-CAN-21661 / CVE-2023-40475)

    H.265 video streams in GStreamer versions before 1.22.6.

    Impact:
    It is possible for a malicious third party to trigger a crash in the
    application, and possibly also effect code execution through stack
    manipulation.
