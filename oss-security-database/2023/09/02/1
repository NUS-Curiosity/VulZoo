Subject: CVE-2023-41180: Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++: Incorrect Certificate
 Validation in InvokeHTTP for MiNiFi C++ 

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ 0.13.0 through 0.14.0

Description:

Incorrect certificate validation in InvokeHTTP on Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ versions 0.13 to 0.14 allows an intermediary to present a forged certificate during TLS handshake negotation. The Disable Peer Verification property of InvokeHTTP was effectively flipped,  disabling verification by default, when using HTTPS.

Mitigation: Set the Disable Peer Verification property of InvokeHTTP to true when using MiNiFi C++ versions 0.13.0 or 0.14.0. Upgrading to MiNiFi C++ 0.15.0 corrects the default behavior.

This issue is being tracked as MINIFICPP-2170
