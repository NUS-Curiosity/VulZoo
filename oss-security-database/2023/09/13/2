 Information Disclosure

CVE-2023-41081 Apache Tomcat Connectors (mod_jk) Information Disclosure

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
- Apache Tomcat Connectors mod_jk Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.48

Description:
In some circumstances, such as when a configuration included
"JkOptions +ForwardDirectories" but the configuration did not provide 
explicit mounts for all possible proxied requests, mod_jk would use an 
implicit mapping and map the request to the first defined worker. Such 
an implicit mapping could result in the unintended exposure of the 
status worker and/or bypass security constraints configured in httpd. As 
of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping functionality has been removed and 
all mappings must now be via explicit configuration.
Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The ISAPI redirector is not affected.

Mitigation:
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat Connector (mod_jk) 1.2.49 or later.
- Ensure explicit mounts are configured for all possible proxied
   requests

Credit:
This vulnerability was reported responsibly to the Tomcat security team 
by Karl von Randow.
