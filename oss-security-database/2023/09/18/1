It's a per-illumos-distro property.  OmniOS has Stable & LTS releases.   Here's the current-stable
release notes, dynamically updated every time they update:

	https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/blob/r151046/doc/ReleaseNotes.md

So I'm not sure if a few days of advance notice would make those quicker,
but I do know that other distros have biweekly scheduled releases, and advance
notice there would keep those wheels spinning faster.  Esp. since "patch tuesday"
is a mere one-day before the release branch is forked off on release weeks.

Our security coordination in illumos is to warn distro-runners, and they make their own
decisions based on that data. None have ever violated embargos.

Thanks,
Dan
