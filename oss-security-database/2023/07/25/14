Does AMD make OS-loadable μcode patches available for client platforms,
or must all μcode loading on clients be done by the firmware?  If the
latter, then it will take a very long time for clients to get patched,
even if AMD released the updates promptly.  Also, server platforms can
usually reflash the firmware via the BMC, but client platforms do not
have this option.
