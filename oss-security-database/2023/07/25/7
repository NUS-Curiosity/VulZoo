Subject: Re: Our learnings from 42 Linux kernel exploits, we
 are limiting io_uring

Hi,

https://yanglingxi1993.github.io/dirty_pagetable/dirty_pagetable.html

has been updated with exploit information.

I tried to backtrack through kernel git to find the exact commit where
this locking problem got fixed, but I gave up after a while after multiple
refactoring (and a filemove) in the io_uring codel.

Cia, Marcus
