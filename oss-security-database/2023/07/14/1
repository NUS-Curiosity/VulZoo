                     Xen Security Notice 1

         winpvdrvbuild.xenproject.org potentially compromised

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Software running on the Xen Project hosted subdomain
winpvdrvbuild.xenproject.org is outdated and vulnerable to several
CVEs.  Some of the reported issues include remote code execution.  The
affected host was running the Jenkins build system for the Windows PV
Drivers subproject.

IMPACT
======

Since the list of CVEs reported include remote code execution we no
longer have confidence that binaries previously available at:

https://xenbits.xen.org/pvdrivers/win/

are trustworthy.  This includes binaries signed with Xen Project's EV
key that is cross-signed by Microsoft.

Note that the source code for the windows drivers, hosted on
xenbits.xen.org is in a separate system and we are confident that it
has not been tampered with.  The EV key was also not available to the
possibly compromised system.

ACTIONS TAKEN
=============

The possibly compromised system has been decommissioned.

We have removed all previous binaries from:

https://xenbits.xen.org/pvdrivers/win/

A new set of drivers based on the current master branch
(9.0-unstable) and built on a trusted environment have been uploaded
on the same folder with the following hashes:

ACTIONS IN PROGRESS
===================

The security team is attempting to inspect existing binaries to
determine whether there are any obvious signs of tampering.

CREDITS
=======

We would like to thank Mahmud Hasan for bringing this to our
attention.

WHAT IS AN XSN
==============

A Xen Security Notice is a mechanism the Security Team was already in
the process of introducing, for providing official communication of
security-relevant information that is not of the form that fits in the
normal XSA template.  Please bear with us as we find the right balance
while trying to fast-track it into use.
