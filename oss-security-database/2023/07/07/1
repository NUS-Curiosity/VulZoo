Subject: manjaro pamac vulnerability

FYI, I noticed a blog post about this:

https://github.com/c-skills/vala-vala-hey/blob/master/vala-vala-hey

I didn't test it, but if you can't trust stealth who can you trust? :)

I'm not familiar with manjaro, I dunno if it's the polkit config for their dbus service.
