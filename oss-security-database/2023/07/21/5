Wednesday's release was a security-only release, the two patches it
contains are very simple, unlikely to break any existing installation,
and one of these patches at least (the s/error/fatal/ one) is very easy
to backport.

But the OpenSSH developers have done an amazing job and have not only
prepared these security-only patches, they have also prepared two more
defense-in-depth patches (which are more intrusive and therefore need
testing by the community first):

https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/29ef8a04866ca14688d5b7fed7b8b9deab851f77
https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/099cdf59ce1e72f55d421c8445bf6321b3004755

The first one of these patches is probably what you are looking for
("check if a library is a PKCS#11 library without having to load it").

Thanks again to the OpenSSH developers for their incredible work! With
best regards,
