I don’t think this helps much though, right? The Qualys research that 
motivated this found an exploit chain using only libs present in 
/usr/lib in a default Ubuntu install. If you want to lock down loading 
to a specific non-/usr/lib path that you have control over, this 
suggests you know and are in control of the PKCS#11 providers you’re 
going to support. In which case, why not avoid dynamic loading to begin 
with? I guess the allowlist and new defaults are the answer to this 
conundrum though.
