Yes its weird.

I was also confused and actually only spotted the OSS software being
affected on third read over their page.

They also reference CERT and VINCE, but at least SUSE was not pulled
into the VINCE issue if there was any. (as CERT has not published
anything I am not sure there was any besides the Cisco disclosure).

Also postfix timeline starts 4 days ago only.
