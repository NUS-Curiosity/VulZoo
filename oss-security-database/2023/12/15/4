Subject: CVE-2023-30867: Apache StreamPark (incubating): Authenticated
 system users could trigger SQL injection vulnerability 

Severity: low

Affected versions:

- Apache StreamPark (incubating) 2.0.0 before 2.1.2

Description:

In the Streampark platform, when users log in to the system and use certain features, some pages provide a name-based fuzzy search, such as job names, role names, etc. The sql syntax :select * from table where jobName like '%jobName%'. However, the jobName field may receive illegal parameters, leading to SQL injection. This could potentially result in information leakage.

Mitigation:

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.1.2, which fixes the issue.
