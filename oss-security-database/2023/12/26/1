Fair enough.

To me, that's not an easy comparison at all.  Most large companies or
their employees do give something these days, and without actual metrics
I cannot tell if e.g. Huawei or Microsoft contributes more.

I think Greg's stance on this is inconsistent, if we also recall his
preference against full public disclosure of issues discussed on private
lists and his running of private lists on CPU microarchitectural issues.

However, the concern about leaks is valid.  I think the most effective
defense we have is the 14 days maximum embargo time, which removes the
data's long-term value for potential use in attacks.
