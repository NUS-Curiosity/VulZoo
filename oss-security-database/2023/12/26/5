Can you update the text for this (or point me to the proper way/persons
to do this)?

1.
"sendmail through at least 8.14.7"
->
sendmail up to and including 8.17.2

2.
remove the seemingly unrelated reference to
"Merge sendmail 8.14.8 to HEAD  freebsd/freebsd-src@...76dd"

3.
Mention that 8.18 fixes the problem:
	Accept only CR LF . CR LF as end of an SMTP message as
		required by the RFCs when the new srv_features
		option 'o' is used.

sendmail 8.18.0.2 is available at
https://ftp.sendmail.org/snapshots/sendmail.8.18.0.2.tar.gz
