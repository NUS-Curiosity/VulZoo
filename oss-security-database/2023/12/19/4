Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2023-43826: Apache Guacamole: Integer overflow in
 handling of VNC image buffers

Severity: important
Base CVSS Score: 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

Affected versions:

- Apache Guacamole through 1.5.3

Description:

Apache Guacamole 1.5.3 and older do not consistently ensure that values 
received from a VNC server will not result in integer overflow. If a 
user connects to a malicious or compromised VNC server, specially 
crafted data could result in memory corruption, possibly allowing 
arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the running guacd 
process.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.5.4, which fixes this issue.
