Subject: SLAM: Spectre based on Linear Address Masking

A vulnerability in closed source CPUs which open source OSes may need
to mitigate was disclosed today:

The first page lists these processors as affected:

    - Existing AMD CPUs vulnerable to CVE-2020-12965;
    - Future Intel CPUs supporting LAM (both 4- and 5-level paging);
    - Future AMD CPUs supporting UAI and 5-level paging;
    - Future Arm CPUs supporting TBI and 5-level paging.

as it takes advantage of CPU features which allow masking off some bits of
pointer addresses to store additional data in, such as Intel’s Linear Address
Masking (LAM), AMD’s Upper Address Ignore (UAI), or ARM's Top-byte Ignore (TBI).
