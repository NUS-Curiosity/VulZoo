It's not so much about competing with or doing things before RedHat as it
is about taking care of our users.  Since June of this year we are no
longer beholden to RedHat for patches.  Being on the distro list could mean
getting patches out sooner but that's more or less a side effect, not
necessarily the goal - though the goal IS getting patches to users as
quickly as possible, especially those shared on the private list, for
obvious reasons.

We didn't apply for the distros list before June as there was really no
point since we were tied to being a clone of RH, but that has now changed
since we are no longer just a clone, but a compatible downstream OS where
we can (and have been) make our own changes.

We very likely would be happy to help in this regard, especially if much of
it can be done without necessarily being on the private side of the list.
The folks on our side that would be great at this type of work are not the
same as those of us (myself and Andrew) that would be on the embargoed list.
