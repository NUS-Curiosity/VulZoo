Alexander,

Thank you very much for doing the research and the summary.
There is another point that I am concerned about.
Based on what I know, in 2021, China passed a legislature that requires
people to disclose vulnerabilities to the Chinese government within 2 days.
I don't have a good grasp on the actual terms/conditions, but based on this:
https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/product-security-vulnerabilites/

*(2) Infomation on the relevant vulnerabilities shall be reported to the
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's network security threat
and vulnerability information-sharing platform within 2 days; The content
sent shall include the name, model number, and version of the products in
which network product security vulnerabilities exist, as well as the
vulnerability's technical characteristics, threat, scope of impact, and so
forth.*

I read it as adding Chinese entities or residents to the list would force
them to disclose a subset of security vulnerabilities to the Chinese
government before public disclosure.
