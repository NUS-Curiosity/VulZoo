Hey!

I'm currently on holidays so sorry for my briefness. I couldn't miss a
chance to comment on this.

Our team at Google is working on generating CVEs for Syzkaller findings.
This is not trivial.

No, they are not. Most (all?) are bugs, so they probably should get fixed,
but I don't think we can claim them all to be vulnerabilities. Even if we
did, we probably should help NVD figure out severity for the CVSS or they
will just have to guess randomly. Figuring out a criteria for what is worth
a CVE and what is not, as well as deduplicating is probably the main bulk
of the work here.

So right now we have been experimenting with this and want to start with a
basic heuristic to generate OSV identifiers. If it goes well with OSV we
may start generating CVEs.

We analyzed crashes and concluded the only ones we are confident on
generating CVEs automatically are KASAN crashes that aren't null-ptr-deref
https://github.com/google/cvelist/blob/cve-automation/fuzzer/syzkaller/unique_to_delta.py#L51
but we will revise this criteria after we have a first version.

Anyway, as you can imagine, we know generating CVEs automatically can have
a significant disrupting effect on the industry as a lot of the regulation
and process depend on it, so we want to minimize the hatemail we'll get.

Anyway, for the curious on our progress
  - https://github.com/google/cvelist/tree/cve-automation/fuzzer has some
details
  -
https://github.com/google/cvelist/blob/cve-automation/fuzzer/syzkaller/output.json
has the output of our current heuristics

Any feedback is welcome!
