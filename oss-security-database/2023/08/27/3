Do you plan to generate CVEs only for fixed issues, or also for unfixed
ones?  The latter might be better, as it would reflect the actual
security of the Linux kernel.

The issues also need to actually be fixed.  That will require that
somebody (Google, Red Hat, Oracle, or someone else) hires additional
people to do the work.

Much of the problem comes from generating a huge number of reports and
not helping to fix them.  This causes upstream maintainers to
de-prioritize syzbot reports or even outright burn out (as in the case
of Darrick Wong).

Does this include unfixed vulnerabilities?
