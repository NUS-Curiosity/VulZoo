SECURITY-3106 / CVE-2023-40336
Folders Plugin 6.846.v23698686f0f6 and earlier does not require POST
requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to copy an item, which could
potentially automatically approve unsandboxed scripts and allow the
execution of unsafe scripts.


SECURITY-3105 / CVE-2023-40337
Folders Plugin 6.846.v23698686f0f6 and earlier does not require POST
requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to copy a view inside a folder.


SECURITY-3109 / CVE-2023-40338
Folders Plugin displays an error message when attempting to access the Scan
Organization Folder Log if no logs are available.

In Folders Plugin 6.846.v23698686f0f6 and earlier, this error message
includes the absolute path of a log file, exposing information about the
Jenkins controller file system.


SECURITY-3090 / CVE-2023-40339
Config File Provider Plugin 952.va_544a_6234b_46 and earlier does not mask
(i.e., replace with asterisks) credentials specified in configuration files
when they're written to the build log.


SECURITY-3196 / CVE-2023-40340
NodeJS Plugin integrates with Config File Provider Plugin to specify custom
NPM settings, including credentials for authentication, in a Npm config
file.

NodeJS Plugin 1.6.0 and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with
asterisks) credentials specified in the Npm config file in Pipeline build
logs.


SECURITY-3116 / CVE-2023-40341
Blue Ocean Plugin 1.27.5 and earlier does not require POST requests for an
HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified
URL, capturing GitHub credentials associated with an attacker-specified
job.


SECURITY-3115 / CVE-2023-4301 (CSRF) & CVE-2023-4302 (missing permission check)
Fortify Plugin 22.1.38 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting
in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.


SECURITY-3140 / CVE-2023-4303
Fortify Plugin 22.1.38 and earlier does not escape the error message for a
form validation method. This results in an HTML injection vulnerability.

NOTE: Since Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2, a security hardening for form
validation responses prevents JavaScript execution, so no scripts can be
injected.


SECURITY-3223 / CVE-2023-40342
Flaky Test Handler Plugin 1.2.2 and earlier does not escape JUnit test
contents when showing them on the Jenkins UI.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control JUnit report file contents.


SECURITY-3229 / CVE-2023-40343
Tuleap Authentication Plugin 1.1.20 and earlier does not use a
constant-time comparison when checking whether two authentication tokens
are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid authentication token.


SECURITY-3214 (1) / CVE-2023-40344
Delphix Plugin 3.0.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an
HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.


SECURITY-3214 (2) / CVE-2023-40345
Delphix Plugin 3.0.2 and earlier does not set the appropriate context for
credentials lookup, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials otherwise
reserved for the global configuration.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to access and capture
credentials they are not entitled to.


SECURITY-3071 / CVE-2023-40346
Shortcut Job Plugin 0.4 and earlier does not escape the shortcut
redirection URL.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to configure shortcut jobs.


SECURITY-3153 / CVE-2023-40347
Maven Artifact ChoiceListProvider (Nexus) Plugin 1.14 and earlier does not
set the appropriate context for credentials lookup, allowing the use of
System-scoped credentials otherwise reserved for the global configuration.

This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to access and capture
credentials they are not entitled to.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2894 / CVE-2023-40348 (information disclosure) & CVE-2023-40349 (insecure default)
Gogs Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at `/gogs-webhook` that can be used
to trigger builds of jobs. In Gogs Plugin 1.0.15 and earlier, an option to
specify a Gogs secret for this webhook is provided, but not enabled by
default.

This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs
corresponding to the attacker-specified job name.

Additionally, the output of the webhook endpoint includes whether a job
corresponding to the attacker-specified job name exists, even if the
attacker has no permission to access it.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-2811 / CVE-2023-40350
Docker Swarm Plugin processes Docker responses to generate the Docker Swarm
Dashboard view.

Docker Swarm Plugin 1.11 and earlier does not escape values returned from
Docker before inserting them into the Docker Swarm Dashboard view. This
results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by
attackers able to control responses from Docker.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.


SECURITY-3201 / CVE-2023-40351
Favorite View Plugin 5.v77a_37f62782d and earlier does not require POST
requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows attackers to add or remove views from another
user's favorite views tab bar.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
