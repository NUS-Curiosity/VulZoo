 |IMO this is an HTTP::Tiny vulnerability.

IMO it is no vulnerability at all since it has "always" been _very
clearly_ (even very lengthily) documented in the manual page.
(Really, even i got that right in my s-cdda-to-db.pl.)
Now you could say it could at build time, or at require time, or
what, do the equivalent to HTTP::Tiny::can_ssl() automatically and
itself, and make that the default (so that it kicks
automatically).
I am just wondering, since i for myself first test can_ssl() in
order to react accordingly, that is, how do i know?, through _it_.
