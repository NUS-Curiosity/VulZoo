Subject: Re: Checking existence of firewalled URLs via
 javascript's script.onload

Hi George,

There are many ways to make arbitrary HTTP requests through a browser, with
and without Javascript.

Here's a good writeup from 2018 from the makers of Burp Suite:
https://portswigger.net/research/exposing-intranets-with-reliable-browser-based-port-scanning

I wouldn't consider this a vulnerability in the browser.

Btw, I remember your exploits from the early 2000s - good stuff :)

Regards,
Philip
