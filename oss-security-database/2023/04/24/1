Subject: Real world vulnerabilities of CWE-1077: Floating Point Comparison
 with Incorrect Operator?

Are there real world examples of vulnerabilities of this:

https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1077.html
CWE-1077: Floating Point Comparison with Incorrect Operator

This issue can prevent the product from running reliably. If the
relevant code is reachable by an attacker, then this reliability
problem might introduce a vulnerability.

One simple example in python:

>>> A=(0.1+0.2)+0.3;B=0.1+(0.2+0.3);(A==B,A-B,A,B)
(False, 1.1102230246251565e-16, 0.6000000000000001, 0.6)
