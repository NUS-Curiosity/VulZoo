 Firefox via iframe.onload

Hello George,

from time to time it happens to rediscover techniques issues.
This is one of those times :)

In 2006 there has been a lot of interest around browser based port
scans, in particular to pivot internal networks.

The following links are some of them:

https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-07/Grossman/Whitepaper/bh-usa-07-grossman-WP.pdf

Some of those thecniques have been mitigated, and some it's still
there.

There are surely other resources IIRC, although some of them might have
been deleted, such as the ones on sla.cke.rs which is a real pity..

Cheers!
Stefano

Ps. this email applies to the other Script technique thread/email as
well.
