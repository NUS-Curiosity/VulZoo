That's true, but irrelevant. The problem is that this function fails to
perform the security function implied by its name. If
HTTP::Tiny supports TLS (instead of rejecting it), it needs to verify TLS certs by default.

If there's function named "isodd()" where "isodd(4) === true", that's a bug,
even if the documentation said that's what it did. The function/method name
implies functionality. You could call it a naming bug. Papering over bugs helps no one.

The *default* of an externally-called function needs to be secure.

I'm sympathetic to the problem of loading in the *right* certs, but systems generally
already have mechanisms for configuring certs. That seems like a solved problem.
