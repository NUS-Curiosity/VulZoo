A vulnerability does not go away if it's documented, and I find that a
rather strange take.

Also I think this discussion was had many times before, as plenty of
libraries in other language ecosystems defaulted to not checking certs
or doing incomplete checks, and over time they all defaulted to the
sane thing: To make the secure setting the default.
The fact that apparently noone has ever checked this for a major perl
library (I mean - CPAN itself, the package manager, is affected) is
quite telling tbh.
