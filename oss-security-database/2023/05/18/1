I think debian stable/bullseye may not be vulnerable with standard kernel:

The exploit write up suggests it requires the ipv6_rpl_srh_compress()
routine to be compiled in
but from my reading of the code (see
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/include/net/rpl.h)
requires CONFIG_IPV6_RPL_LWTUNNEL to be define which isn't in my
latest debian amd64 kernel:

% grep CONFIG_IPV6_RPL_LWTUNNEL /boot/config-5.10.0-23-amd64
# CONFIG_IPV6_RPL_LWTUNNEL is not set

uname -a
Linux fast 5.10.0-23-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.179-1 (2023-05-12)
x86_64 GNU/Linux

Is this reasonable?

Thanks
