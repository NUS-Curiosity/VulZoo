Subject: Re: semi-public issues on (linux-)distros

Hi,

first of all let me take the opportunity to thank you for your work in this
area. I'm not a member of the distros list anymore (have been for years),
but I appreciate very much what you do for the community.

I agree. And I'm happy to see that this is being discussed, as I've seen
Daniel talking on Mastodon about this and it would be a shame if they
wouldn't provide their high quality reports to distributions up front
anymore.

My vote is for option 1.

This is indeed tricky. I would not try to sync this to specific conditions
of the upstream policy, but to the proven track record of an upstream
project. If they can show that they can reliable do this for security
issues below a certain threshold they should get approved to post
semi-public issues onto the list.

And yes, this isn't a hard criterion that can be easily judged, which is
indeed a problem. There could be some form of vote on the list to decide
this for each project asking for it. In my experience the subscribers are
reasonable and I would expect that this would lead to good results.
