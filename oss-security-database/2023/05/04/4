The CVE process is designed with a primary goal of simply providing a unique id
for each claimed vulnerability - it's intended to not have much deeper meaning
than creating a UUID.   There is no requirement that the claimed vulnerability
be well described, proven, accepted, fixed, or anything else beyond not being a
duplicate of an existing CVE entry.

Unfortunately, many CVE consumers assume a far greater level of meaning to CVEs
than the CVE project intends by them.
