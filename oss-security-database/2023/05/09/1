Subject: CVE-2023-2253: distribution/distribution: Catalog API endpoint can
 lead to OOM via malicious user input

Publishing to oss-security as our agreed maximum embargo date has
passed now

Summary
=======

distribution/distribution
(https://github.com/distribution/distribution) is the Open Source
Registry implementation for storing and distributing container images
using the OCI Distribution Specification.

Systems that run distribution/distribution on memory-restricted
environments can suffer from denial of service by a crafted malicious
/v2/_catalog API endpoint request.


Affected software
=================

- CVE ID: CVE-2023-2253
- CVSS Score: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H (important)
- Affected: distribution/distribution < 2.8.2-beta.1 tentatively (!)
(not public yet, see timeline section below)
- Commit introducing the issue:
https://github.com/distribution/distribution/blob/b7e26bac741c76cb792f8e14c41a2163b5dae8df/registry/handlers/catalog.go#L45

The OCI Distribution Specification is *not* affected since the catalog
endpoint was moved to a reserved extension:
https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/c3e48b9d94b104d5e3db2f984bb83a55fb7ac023/extensions/README.md?plain=1#L20


Fix/Patches
===========

Fixes for main and v2.8 are attached to this email.

Patches are available to upstream in the private github advisory (see
timeline section below) but not published yet.


General Recommendation
======================

The /v2/_catalog endpoint was designed specifically to do registry
syncs with search or other API systems. Such an endpoint would create a
lot of load on the backend system, due to overfetch required to serve a
request in certain implementations.

Because of this, we strongly recommend to always this API endpoint
behind heightened privilege and avoid leaving it exposed to the
internet.


Background
==========

/v2/_catalog endpoint accepts a parameter to control the maximum amount
of records returned (query string: n).

When not given the default n=100 is used. The server trusts that n has
an acceptable value, however when using a
maliciously large value, it allocates an array/slice of n of strings
before filling the slice with data.


Steps to reproduce (provided by Jose Gomez (SUSE))
==================================================

Have a running registry with at least one image on it. and pass a 
sufficiently long
`n` to the `/v2/_catalog`.

Timeline
========
- 2023-01-27: Issue was reported by Jose Gomez (SUSE) to upstream via
email to the cncf-distribution-security list
- 2023-02-06: Response from upstream, they created a private github
advisory repository to work collaboratively on a fix
- 2023-02-07: Coordinated release date set to 2023-04-27 13:00 UTC (90
days)
- 2023-02-10: Initial fix provided by Jose Gomez in the private github
advisory for main branch, discussions and improvements
- 2023-03-21: Backport provided by Jose Gomez in the private v2.8
branch, discussions and improvements
- 2023-04-07: I asked upstream in the github advisory for a CVE, no
response
- 2023-04-24: I posted to distros to ask for a CVE, new CRD agreed with
upstream to 2023-05-08 13:00 UTC (max 14 days as per distros list
policy); also pre-notified quay and the OCI security contact
- 2023-04-25: The OCI security contact provided insight into the OCI
spec, upstream added recommendation to advisory to block the endpoint;
OCI spec itself is not affected
- 2023-05-08: Upstream asked to move coordinated release date +1 day
due to bank holiday, we agreed to new CRD: 2023-05-09 15:00 UTC
- 2023-05-09 15:00 UTC: Publish to oss-security since the maximum
agreed embargo period has passed
