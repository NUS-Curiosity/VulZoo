Let me add some cents here from SUSE perspective.

At SUSE we are common criteria certified, including the handling of
embargoed issues, which has similar strictness.

For CC we have to have processes in such a way that embargoed information
must not touch or be controlled by third party systems not within the
CC scope, which basically excludes everything not in the protected space
of our physical SUSE datacenter.

So we have real tight need to know, "must not leave any SUSE premise or
SUSE employee eyes" rules on embargoed security issues.

Relevant scope of information is really "anything where people can derive
knowledge from", and this includes security patched binaries (or also
rpm changelogs).


In regards to distros, 
https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros
is similar strict.

>From this page all info on distros is (at least) TLP:AMBER ( https://www.first.org/tlp/ )
and TLP:AMBER would exclude disclosing information outside of the need-to-know within your organization.

I understand that while some of the operators of the public clouds are also on
the distro lists, these are parts of very large cooperations and not the same
team as the intake PSIRT subscribed to distros.

So from my point I would suggest to exclude testing on third party public clouds.

Ciao, Marcus
