Subject: CVE-2023-34212: Apache NiFi: Potential Deserialization of
 Untrusted Data with JNDI in JMS Components 

Severity: important

Affected versions:

- Apache NiFi 1.8.0 through 1.21.0

Description:

The JndiJmsConnectionFactoryProvider Controller Service, along with the ConsumeJMS and PublishJMS Processors, in Apache NiFi 1.8.0 through 1.21.0 allow an authenticated and authorized user to configure URL and library properties that enable deserialization of untrusted data from a remote location.

The resolution validates the JNDI URL and restricts locations to a set of allowed schemes.

This issue is being tracked as NIFI-11614
