Thanks for the feedback.  Subscribers to oss-security are by far not
only distros, though.

I also received 5 off-list replies (as I had asked for).  All of them
were against somewhat off-topic content like Georgi's recent postings
getting through to the list on further occasions.  So the list will be
moderated more strictly accordingly.

No need for further replies to this thread, please.
