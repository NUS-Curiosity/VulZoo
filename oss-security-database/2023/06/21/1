ChatGPT will indeed generate ‘average’ quality code. That’s absolutely
ending up on GitHub and in dependency repositories. IMO, the situation
hasn’t changed for us, more code than ever before growing super-linearly
and tools that produce a bunch of noise.
On the other side - future coding buddies will be able to use Retrieval
Augmented Generation for policy following to generate high quality code
with more reliability.
