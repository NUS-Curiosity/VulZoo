OSSA-2023-001: Arbitrary file access through custom S3 XML entities
===================================================================

:Date: January 17, 2023
:CVE: CVE-2022-47950


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Swift: <2.28.1, >=2.29.0 <2.29.2, ==2.30.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Sébastien Meriot (OVH) reported a vulnerability in Swift's S3 XML
parser. By supplying specially crafted XML files an authenticated user
may coerce the S3 API into returning arbitrary file contents from the
host server resulting in unauthorized read access to potentially
sensitive data; this impacts both s3api deployments (Rocky or later),
and swift3 deployments (Queens and earlier, no longer actively
developed). Only deployments with S3 compatibility enabled are
affected.
