Subject: CVE Request -- Ekiga (x < 4.0.0): DoS (crash) after receiving call
 from other party with not UTF-8 valid name

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  a denial of service flaw was found in the way Ekiga,
a Gnome based SIP/H323 teleconferencing application,
processed information from certain OPAL connections
([certain] UTF-8 strings were not verified for validity
prior showing them). A remote attacker (other party with
a not UTF-8 valid name) could use this flaw to cause
ekiga executable crash.

Upstream bug report:
[1] https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=653009

Relevant upstream patch:
[2] http://git.gnome.org/browse/ekiga/commit/?id=7d09807257

References:
[3] http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/ekiga/4.0/ekiga-4.0.0.news
[4] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=883058

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
