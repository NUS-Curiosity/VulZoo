Subject: CVE request: Dovecot DoS in 2.x (fixed in 2.1.11)

Could a CVE be assigned for the following please?

Dovecot 2.1.11 was released and includes a fix for a crash condition
when the IMAP server was issued a SEARCH command with multiple KEYWORD
parameters.  An authenticated remote user could use this flaw to crash
Dovecot.

The upstream fix was to remove the keyword merging code.  This code
does not exist in Dovecot 1.x, but it does affect 2.x versions, at least
as far back as 2.0.9 (earliest version I checked).
