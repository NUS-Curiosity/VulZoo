Please continue to use CVE-2012-5645 for
http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/freeciv?view=revision&revision=21701
Added return value indicating success or failure for all dio_get_xxx()
functions, and check that value to avoid infinite loop in reading arrays
from network when there's no more data even though it's expected.

For
http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/freeciv?view=revision&revision=21672
Sanity check packet length received over network against values
less than header length alone to avoid situation where body length
is considered negative.

Please use CVE-2012-6083 for this issue.
