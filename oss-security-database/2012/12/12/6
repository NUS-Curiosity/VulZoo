>Locale::Maketext is a core l10n library

>Two problems were found

Several other parties have recently contacted MITRE's cve-assign
address with information that may overlap this Locale::Maketext
disclosure. The information is not yet public in all of the cases, and
can potentially affect the number of CVEs assigned. For now, we would
prefer that other CNAs allow MITRE to assign CVEs that are related to:

  - behavior of Locale::Maketext itself

  - security issues in use of Locale::Maketext by Perl-based products

  - security announcements from vendors who are attempting to work
    around a real or perceived Locale::Maketext issue

We'll try to get the full set of CVE IDs sent here as soon as possible.
