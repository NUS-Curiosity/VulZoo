I didn't try it out by now. 

Even though this is really not the best behavior at least I don't see
a real security issue here. Of course you could download a file called
foo.c"rm -rf /", open it and try to run it, but this would only be
executed with user's context which in the end doesn't make any
differences whether you having a shell script like

#!/bin/sh
rm -rf /;

or funny_shell_script.sh"rm -rf /" downloading. /dev/user is needed
here. 

However, should be fixed of course as its dangerous behavior
nevertheless. ;)

Just my 2ct. 

Cheers, 
Frank
