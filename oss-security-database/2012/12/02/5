Subject: Re: Re: [Full-disclosure] MySQL (Linux) Stack based
 buffer overrun PoC Zeroday

Hi,
My opinion is that the FILE to admin privilege elevation should be patched.
What is the reason to have FILE and ADMIN privileges seperated when
with this exploit
FILE privileges equate to ALL ADMIN privileges.
I understand that it's insecure to have FILE privileges attached to a user.
But if this a configuration issue and not a vulnerability then as
stated above there must be something wrong with the privilege
management in this SQL server.

With Kind Regards,

Kingcope
