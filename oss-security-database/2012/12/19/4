I was mistaken, I assumed that Fedora was shipping Matthew's 0.1 code, 
which differs significantly from the 0.2 code.  But it turns out that 
Fedora ships 0.2 instead (since the end of November).  Oh well.

Yes, or the UEFI implementation on the box is buggy.  It could not boot 
the installer before, but now it can.

Aren't vendors basing their implementation on the open-source code from 
Intel?  Or are you referring to the fact that Secure Boot has little to 
do with security?
