Lenovo M72e 0896A9G

This is a business-class Windows 8 machine which comes with a Windows 8 
logo sticker, so Secure Boot was enabled in the factory (and my testing 
reflected that).  I'm not sure if the type number encodes thatâ€”Lenovo 
surely offers essentially the same hardware with Secure Boot disabled by 
default, so that customers can install Windows 7 more easily.

Uhm, aren't there a couple of them in circulation?

The Fedora 18 TC3 installer boots on the machine mentioned above, in the 
factory default configuration.  Previous installer versions showed a 
Secure Boot error message.  I've run into an installer bug, though:
