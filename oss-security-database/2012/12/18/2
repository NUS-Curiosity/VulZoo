Subject: CVE Request -- Freeciv (X < 2.3.3): DoS (memory exhaustion or
 excessive CPU consumption) via malformed network packets

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  Freeciv upstream has released 2.3.3 version correcting one
security issue:

A denial of service flaw was found in the way the server component
of Freeciv, a turn-based, multi-player, X based strategy game,
processed certain packets (invalid packets with whole packet length
lower than packet header size or syntactically valid packets, but
whose processing would lead to an infinite loop). A remote attacker
could send a specially-crafted packet that, when processed would lead
to freeciv server to terminate (due to memory exhaustion) or become
unresponsive (due to excessive CPU use).
