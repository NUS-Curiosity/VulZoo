If someone has access to modify a users home directory, it's safe to
assume that they can execute commands as that user. It's like saying
"if someone gains root access to your system, they can replace your
binaries with trojan kits that open them up to remote root access".
It's not really a security issue if you can gain access you already
have.

terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
