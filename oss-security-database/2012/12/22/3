Possibly.  I usually don't bother to try to find exploits,
so I can't say for sure.

If memory serves you also need to update gnulib.

The set of patches is tricky enough that it is probably
better to upgrade to 2.11; that's simpler, and arguably
it's more likely to be safe.  You might want to fix
the two bugs that were introduced in 2.11 (see
the NEWS file), but you probably already have a 2.11
package that does that, somewhere.  You might also
want to undo the -r change introduced in 2.11.
