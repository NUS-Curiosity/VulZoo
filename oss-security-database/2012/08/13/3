Sorry maybe it's just late but I'm not finding any links to the
vulnerable code/fixed code which makes it difficult to verify these
issues. If you could put links to the affected code/lines so I can
quickly verify that would be helpful. E.g. I might need to merge some
of these (#3 and #4 and #5 for example are all input validation?).
