Subject: CVE Request -- glibc: Integer overflows, leading to stack-based
 buffer overflows in strto* related routines

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  multiple integer overflows, leading to stack-based buffer overflows were found in various stdlib functions of GNU libc (strtod, strtof, strtold, strtod_l and related routines). If an application, using the affected stdlib functions, did not perform user-level sanitization of provided inputs, a local attacker could use this flaw to cause such an application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

Upstream bug report:
[1] http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=14459

Upstream patch (might not be the final one):
[2] http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2012-08/msg00202.html

References:

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
