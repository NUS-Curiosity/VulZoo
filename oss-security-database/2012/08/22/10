As a moderator for oss-security, I hesitated about approving the posting
above, but I decided to give it a try so that list members and not
moderators can decide whether such postings are welcome or not (for
future occasions).  As previously discussed, we're currently rejecting
conference and e-magazine CFPs, as well as e-magazine issue
announcements.  In a way, CTF announcements are similar, however they
might be less frequent (although this might change if we become known
for approving them for distribution).  Another aspect is Open Source
relevance.  I guess most CTFs are Open Source relevant, but they may
lack sufficient Open Source focus for this list.

Please help us decide.

Thanks,

Alexander
