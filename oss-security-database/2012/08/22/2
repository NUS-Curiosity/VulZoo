Subject: CVE Request: Apache mod RPAF denial of service

Hi,

SÃ©bastien Bocahu reported to the Debian security team a denial of service 
issue in the Apache module RPAF (reverse proxy add forward).

http://bugs.debian.org/683984

Version 0.6 is not affected, 0.5 is and we've released a security update for 
that. Can someone please assign a CVE id to this issue?


Thanks,
Thijs
