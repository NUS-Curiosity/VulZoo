Subject: CVE Request: gnome-keyring: improper caching of gpg password/passphrase

Hi All,

gnome-keyring does not obey the configuration asking it
to stop caching passphrases after a while.

More details and patches available at the following
references:

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=681081
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=845426

Upstream bug suggests that this is a regression from 3.3.x.
But it seems some older versions may also be affected.

Can a CVE id be please assigned to this issue?

Thanks!
