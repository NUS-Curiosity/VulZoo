Subject: CVE request: Ganglia Web 3.5.1

Not a lot of details on this one, but could a CVE be assigned to this?

Upstream has released Ganglia Web 3.5.1 [1] which includes a fix for a
security flaw going back to 3.1.7 and possibly earlier versions.  This
flaw can lead to the arbitrary execution of scripts with the privileges
of the web user (apache or nobody), which could possibly lead to other
compromises or data exposure.  This flaw has been fixed in upstream
3.5.1.  No further information is currently available regarding the flaw
or a patch.
