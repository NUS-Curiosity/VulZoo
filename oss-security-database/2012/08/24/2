As you have pointed out, most CTFs are Open Source related and
definietly focus on security. This is exacly what the name of the list
is. As many may think, it's not cve-designation list only (obviously I
may be wrong about that).

In the other hand, it would be sad to see oss-security list turning
into the place, where people are writing walktroughs, spoilers and
asks for help (which IMHO would be unavoidable).
Filtering all the garbage could be overhelming for moderators.

Maybe you will consider launching a dedicated list for CTFs only?
