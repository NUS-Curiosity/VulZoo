Subject: zenoss issues

Hello,

I have found xss and command execution problems with zenoss. I created a
bugreport which can be found at http://jira.zenoss.com/jira/browse/ZEN-3183 .
However the zenoss developers don't seem to be able to reproduce the issues.

Another issue, reported by Emanuel Bronshtein can be found at
http://jira.zenoss.com/jira/browse/ZEN-3153

Regards,
Thomas Pollet
