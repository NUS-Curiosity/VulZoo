Just to be clear I am unwilling (and unable) to accept reference links
for OpenSource related CVE assignments that require:

1) a login (it's highly annoying and leads to points 2 and 3), this
also breaks automated tools that download related links in the CVE
database, not cool.
2) click through agreements (often required for logins)
3) acceptance of restrictive forms of legal agreements (e.g. NDAs)

You need to source public information that is easily accessible and
can be downloaded without significant human intervention (like
creating an account).
