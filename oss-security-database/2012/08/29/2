Subject: CVE Request -- wireshark (X >= 1.6.8): DoS (excessive CPU use and
 infinite loop) in DRDA dissector

Hello Kurt, Steve, Gerald, vendors,

  a denial of service flaw was found in the way Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) dissector of Wireshark, a network traffic analyzer, performed processing of certain DRDA packet capture files. A remote attacker could create a specially-crafted capture file that, when opened could lead to wireshark executable to consume excessive amount of CPU time and hang with an infinite loop.

Issue found by: Martin Wilck

Affected versions: Seems to affect wireshark 1.6.x versions and
                   later (1.0.x and 1.2.x definitely aren't affected)

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
