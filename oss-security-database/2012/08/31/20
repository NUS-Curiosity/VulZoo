All the bug reports I mentioned are about exactly the same issue. The non-
public ones have been marked as duplicates of the public one.

I'm aware of at least 5.4.0 RC5 containing the incomplete fix[1], but I don't 
know in which exact RC version it made its way into. 5.4.0 beta2 was still 
vulnerable to CVE-2011-1398.

PHP 5.4.1 RC1 already had the proper fix.

So, since at least PHP 5.4.0 had the incomplete fix, I guess a new CVE for 
the incomplete fix is in order. Kurt, could you please assign one?

Please let me know if it's not clear enough yet.
