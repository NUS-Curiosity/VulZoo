Take a look here, an example of CVE description: 
http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2012-2677

Integer overflow in the ordered_malloc function in boost/pool/pool.hpp in 
Boost Pool before 3.9 makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to 
perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size 
value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.

So, in this case, if you don't provide to any info, what Kurt should write?

Please post the diff between the vulnerable code and the fix so we are sure 
that is a security issue.
