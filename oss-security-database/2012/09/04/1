As for PHP 5.3/5.2, the three patches are of concern,
 [1] http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/branches/PHP_5_3/main/SAPI.c?r1=321634&r2=322263
 [2] http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/trunk/main/SAPI.c?r1=321634&r2=323033
 [3] http://svn.php.net/viewvc/php/php-src/branches/PHP_5_4/main/SAPI.c?r1=323986&r2=323985&pathrev=323986

First one still has the possibility of injecting '\r' before the first '\n'.
The second one kills the protection for the NUL byte check, so it won't
allow header splitting for Apache SAPI, but FastCGI stuff will be affected,
as per Stefan Esser's assessment,
  http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.devel/70584
Third one fixes the issue.

The check for 5.3 tags yields:
 - 5.3.11, https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/704bbb3263d0ec9a6b4a767bbc516e55388f4b0e/main/SAPI.c#L593
   has the issue completely fixed
 - 5.3.10, https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/e4afa14812d10da7413096c742470fb0582ebc95/main/SAPI.c#L593
   has none of the mentioned fixes.

The check for 5.2 tags shows that
 - 5.2.17, https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/dabfd7727f5496ebd913488f6a996117f8597686/main/SAPI.c
   has none of the mentioned fixes.

So, seems like we have the following vulnerable main versions:
  5.2.0 <= php < 5.3.11, 5.4.0 <= php < 5.4.1.
