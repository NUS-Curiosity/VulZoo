Not if it respects your umask. If you want privacy set your umask
correctly. Programs can't know what they're supposed to do unless you
tell them. And we tell the system using umask.

I'm confused. It's not exposed unless you configure umask wrong and
run this in a public viewable directory. If you want a CVE for every
single program that doesn't ensure it's (potentially sensitive) output
is mode 0600 than that's basically, well, all the programs on a system.
