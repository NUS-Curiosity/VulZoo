Subject: CVE-2009-4030 regression in mysql

Hi All,

It was found that the fix for CVE-2009-4030 was not present in mysql
version 5.0.88, as claimed by upstream.

As a result of this, Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2012:0127 which
rebased mysql in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 to 5.0.95, missed the above
fix.

We have assigned CVE-2012-4452 to this issue.
