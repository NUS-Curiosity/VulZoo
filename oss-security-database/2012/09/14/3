I do not have that information yet. The information about intended CVE
assignment till October update was exchanged off list, contact on
Oracle side was Mr. Mehnert.

Early disclosure of this issue was due to misconception, that Oracle
would have assessed severity, need for CVE and communication of
disclosure timeline before releasing patch as maintenance release. The
early disclosure mixed up the whole
reporting/analyze/classify/CVE-assign/disclosure process somehow.

Kind regards,
