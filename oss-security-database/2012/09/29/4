indeed, they were fixed a while ago. It just required a mini
fire-drill to verify that, and ensure the packages we are using in our
deployments indeed had the fixes in. As you point out, the original
problem report didn't have a CVE designation assigned, so the relevant
commit messages and standard security tracking mechanisms didn't
indicate the fixes are included.
A fun way to spend a friday afternoon.

IIRC,  per security process packages/distributors are notified before
the CVE's are made public.  It would be a great fire-drill
extinguisher if the CVE announcement provided a link to a centralized
location (for the CVE) where packages maintainers could update the
distribution information.
