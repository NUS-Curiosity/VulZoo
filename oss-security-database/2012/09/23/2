This is finally patched in 4.0.3:

Frank Denis additionally noted:

"libtiff 4.0.3 brings "various memory buffer access fixes". Does it fix
more than CVE-2012-3401?"

to which I have no answer.  The change log does in fact mention
"Various memory buffer access fixes." as the very first change listed
for libtiff.  Perhaps someone should review code changes.
