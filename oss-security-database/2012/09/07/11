Subject: Re: CVE Request -- urllib3: Does not check for SSL
 certificates by default

Hi there, I'm the author of urllib3.

I would be happy to make urllib3 verify SSL certs by default but I'm not
familiar enough with the nuances of locating the CA's in a distro-agnostic
manner. If anyone has experience or ideas in doing this, please let me
know. Bonus points if it works on OSX.

Thanks!
- Andrey
