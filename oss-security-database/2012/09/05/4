Subject: CVE-Request: openstack pickle de-serialization

Hi,

During openstack review we found that some parts of openstack
used pickle to de-serialize data. This could be used to execute
arbitrary code. Please check here:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/swift/+bug/1006414

Can someone please assign a CVE, for completeness?

thx,
Sebastian
