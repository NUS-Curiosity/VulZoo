Subject: CVE id request: tor

Hi,
from the tor release notes[0]:
Changes in version 0.2.2.39 - 2012-09-11
  Tor 0.2.2.39 fixes two more opportunities for remotely triggerable 
  assertions.

  o Security fixes:
    - Fix an assertion failure in tor_timegm() that could be triggered
      by a badly formatted directory object. Bug found by fuzzing with
      Radamsa. Fixes bug 6811; bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc.
    - Do not crash when comparing an address with port value 0 to an
      address policy. This bug could have been used to cause a remote
      assertion failure by or against directory authorities, or to
      allow some applications to crash clients. Fixes bug 6690; bugfix
      on 0.2.1.10-alpha.

I have not seen CVE ids for these issues.
Can you assign ids for them?
