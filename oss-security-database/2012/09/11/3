Subject: CVE id request: guacd

Hi,
there is a buffer overflow in the protocol handling of guacd.
This issue is confirmed to result in code execution.
Upstream fix:
http://guac-dev.org/trac/changeset/7dcefa744b4a38825619c00ae8b47e5bae6e38c0/libguac

Can we please get a CVE id for this issue?

Kind regards
Nico
