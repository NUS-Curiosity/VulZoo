I agree. Users do know how to use umask properly, but this isn't what umask
is for. The umask for the low order bits are only applied if the program
requested 0666, it's still the responsibility of the program to choose the
appropriate permissions.

Creating sensitive files with 0666 and then saying "set your umask" is just
wrong.
