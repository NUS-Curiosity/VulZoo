Although we suspect this message isn't primarily about CVE assignments,
here are two comments:

>While changing from openntpd (Ubuntu/universe) to ntp (main), a short

>Newer versions come with a default configuration listening on all

The general issue of interface listening in an NTP daemon's
configuration is perhaps best covered by CCE. CCE-4134-3 (in the
http://cce.mitre.org/lists/data/downloads/cce-rhel5-5.20111007.xls
document) is one related identifier.

>Following scenarios come to my mind with the interfaces default
>configuration

Do all of these scenarios require a host and network configuration
that accepts packets with LAN source IP addresses even if these
packets arrive from the Internet interface? Typically it's not the
responsibility of an individual network application program to address
those scenarios. If an application program tried to address such a
scenario but had an implementation error (e.g., it documented
192.168.0.0/16 as a hardcoded safe network but actually had
192.186.0.0/16 hardcoded), that's a different situation and a CVE
could be assigned.
