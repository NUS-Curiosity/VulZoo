I'm attaching a patch that makes mcrypt abort when the salt is longer than 
the temp buffer it uses.

While working on it, I noticed the err_ functions do not have a constant 
printf format, yet there are calls such as:
      sprintf(tmperr, _("Input File: %s\n"), infile);
      err_info(tmperr);
[print_enc_info in src/extra.c]

And a few others in src/mcrypt.c; for instance:
$ mcrypt --no-openpgp "%s.nc" 
mcrypt: h���Fn�`.nc is not a regular file. Skipping...

I'm attaching another patch that prevents the format string attacks.

Cheers,
