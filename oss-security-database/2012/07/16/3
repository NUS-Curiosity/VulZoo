Doing some digging, it looks like this was introduced in kdepim 4.4, and
would not affect earlier versions.  Can anyone confirm this?

I'm cc'ing Laurent Montel who made the commit, and who should be able to
shed some light as to when the vulnerability was introduced, and also
answer Kurt's question above.

Laurent, any information you can provide would be appreciated.
