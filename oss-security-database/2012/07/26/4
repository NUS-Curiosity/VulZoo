Subject: Xen Security Advisory 10 - HVM guest user mode MMIO emulation DoS

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


                 Xen Security Advisory XSA-10

	 HVM guest user mode MMIO emulation DoS vulnerability

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Internal data of the emulator for MMIO operations may, under
certain rare conditions, at the end of one emulation cycle be left
in a state affecting a subsequent emulation such that this second
emulation would fail, causing an exception to be reported to the
guest kernel where none is expected.

IMPACT
======

Guest mode unprivileged (user) code, which has been granted
the privilege to access MMIO regions, may leverage that access
to crash the whole guest.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All HVM guests exposing MMIO ranges to unprivileged (user) mode.

All versions of Xen which support HVM guests are vulnerable to this issue.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be mitigated by running PV (para-virtualised)
guests only, or by ensuring (inside the guest) that MMIO regions
can be accessed only by trustworthy processes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch will resolve the issue.

NOTE REGARDING CVE
==================

We do not yet have a CVE Candidate number for this vulnerability.
