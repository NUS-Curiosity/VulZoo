Subject: CVE Request: quota: incorrect use of tcp_wrappers

Hi All,

rquotad seems to re-use good_client implementation from portmap.
The way good_client called tcp_wrappers via hosts_ctl was not correct,
possibly causing hosts access rules defined in hosts.{allow,deny} not to
be honored.

Reference:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=566717

Can a CVE id be please allocated to this issue? (Possibly 2010 i think)

Thanks!.
