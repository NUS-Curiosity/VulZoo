>This issue does not appear to have a CVE yet ("TBD").

MITRE sent them a CVE name in response to their request this week.
Their request did not happen to include the specific mapping to the
AST-2012-010 identifier, so for now we will not mention the specific
CVE name here, because there's a small chance that the request was
actually not about AST-2012-010. There's a larger chance that this CVE
name will be added to the AST-2012-010 document soon.
