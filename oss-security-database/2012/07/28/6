Subject: ocPortal 7.1.5 <= | Open URL Redirection Vulnerability

1. OVERVIEW

ocPoral CMS 7.1.5 and lower versions are vulnerable to Open URL Redirection.


2. BACKGROUND

ocPortal is the website Content Management System (a CMS) for building
and maintaining a dynamic website. ocPortal's powerful feature-set
means there's always a way to accomplish your vision. Not only does
ocPortal's CMS have all the features you'd expect: for instance photo
galleries, news, file downloads and community forums/chats, but it
does so whilst meeting the highest accessibility and professional
standards. It is also smart enough to go beyond page management, to
automatically handle search engine optimisation, and provide
aggressive hack attack prevention.


3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

ocPoral CMS 7.1.5 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a
remote cross site redirection attack. This flaw exists because the
application does not properly sanitise the "redirect" parameter.  This
allows an attacker to create a specially crafted URL, that if clicked,
would redirect a victim from the intended legitimate web site to an
arbitrary web site of the attacker's choice.


4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

Tested on 7.1.5
