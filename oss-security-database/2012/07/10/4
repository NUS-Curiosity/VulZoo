Subject: libdbus hardening

Hi,

We are going to add a libdbus hardening patch:

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=697105

This is because some suid binaries (Xorg and others) are linked against libdbus and
it seems not right to allow users to route polkit or other
system messages to a fake dbusd via $DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS.

If anyone has a better patch or something even easier, just let us know.

There are certainly also other libs that will receive a patch.

Sebastian
