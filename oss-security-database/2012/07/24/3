Subject: CVE Request: libpng: Out-of heap-based buffer read by inflating certain
 PNG images

Hi All,

An out-of heap-based buffer read flaw was found in the way libpng, a
library of functions or creating and manipulating PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) image format files, performed reading of PNG image file data
when decompressing certain images. A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted PNG file, which once opened in an application linked
against libpng would lead to that application crash.

Thanks!
