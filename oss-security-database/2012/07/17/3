Subject: libjpeg-turbo: Heap-based buffer overflow when decompressing corrupt
 JPEG images

Hi all,

We were made aware of a flaw in libjpeg-turbo by Chris Evans of Google
security team. Details as follows:

A Heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libjpeg-turbo
decompressed certain corrupt JPEG images in which the component count
was erroneously set to a large value. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted JPEG image that, when opened, could cause an
application using libpng to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running the application.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2012-2806.

Upstream release of libjpeg-turbo-1.2.1 resolves this issue.
