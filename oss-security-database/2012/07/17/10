Thanks for the info, Laurent (and thanks for the testcase, David).

I'm still unsure whether or not a CVE is required, as per Kurt's
comments about whether or not kmail was ever advertised as not
executing javascript.

I think because, at one time, it did not execute javascript, and now it
does (which is clearly bad for a mail client to do), it probably does
require a CVE name but before assigning one and getting negative
feedback, I'd like to make sure that assigning one is indeed
appropriate.
