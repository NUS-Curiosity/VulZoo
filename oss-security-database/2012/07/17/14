Yes (it was disabled from the html engine on purpose).

Yes, but by mistake (the code that re-colors quotes in html email was ported 
to webkit, and javascript support is enabled there by default).
Your phrasing makes it sound like it was "support that was added 
intentionnally", which wasn't the case.

Yes (although we discovered it by investigating a crash due to the fact that 
remote images were starting to get loaded too, and then abruptly interrupted, 
something which got disabled at the same time).
