Subject: CVE for JBOSS EAP 5.0(twiddle and jmx invocations) ?

Following this apparently RFE on JBOSS
https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-3391?_sscc=t
i have found a nice description, and an  proposed patch, about it here
http://objectopia.com/2009/10/01/securing-jmx-invoker-layer-in-jboss/.

But the last link describe - apparently - a serious bug in the JBoss JMX
Invoker Layer, a missing authentication that can
produce a serious problem. Reading the other response i don't think there
is today the possibility to enforce a true mitigation
in JBOSS, apart putting in place some form a network control (aka a
firewall). This is for JBOSS 5.0, i know that twiddle is no longer
in JBoss EAP 6.0 which provides a totally new, much improved, secure and
scriptable management interface.

Do you think this can require a CVE for JBOSS EAP 5?

Thanks in advance
