Subject: CVE request: surf

surf does not protect its cookie jar against access read access from
other local users, as reported by Jakub Wilk in this Debian bug:

<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=659296>

Could someone please assign a CVE for this?

uzbl <http://uzbl.org/> (in the uzbl-browser wrapper script) and
netsurf <http://www.netsurf-browser.org/> (the nsgtk_check_homedir
function creates the dot directory with world-readable settings) have
a similar issue, but are from different code bases.  I think those
should get distinct CVEs, too.
