I think this is something that should be discussed (I'm not specifically
against Xen joining, but I'm worried about the precedent it might set).
Many projects incorporate upstream software, if we lower the bar of
entry in this respect we may get a lot more people on the list. This
might not be a good idea (more chances of leaks/etc.).

My understanding of the way the vs security list is used is that
upstream is typically notified (after all, they usually are the ones
fixing the issue), and that people not on the list can post to the list
to notify it of upcoming stuff (this happens all the time), we then CC
them on communications about the issue they reported to keep them in the
loop. For something this specific might it not be a better idea for Xen
just go straight to the qemu project so they can be notified of the
embargoed issues?
