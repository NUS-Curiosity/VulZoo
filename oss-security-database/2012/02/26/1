I've done some research on various frontend to iptables. Most of them
were secure for IPv4 but the IPv6 case was more complicated. But given
the fact there is a gazillon of them this was difficult to check them
all. On Netfilter side, we've decided  to publish the document
explaining how to secure helpers to explain how to fix this. It was some
months ago and I hope it has been read.

I've contacted the frontend developers and Netfilter/Linux firewalls
vendors I knew to have them test their software/equipment. I've started
this some months ago. I've also tried to contact the various CERT but
they refused to handle the case or did not reply to my requests.
