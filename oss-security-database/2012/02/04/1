I think the important aspect here is the transparency of the private
discussion (after an appropriate delay), rather than the length of the
delay itself.  That can be set by the researcher (with some reasonable
maximum, like a month).

We all should be able to see what is going on over in the closed list.
 Although it is unlikely being used for nefarious purposes (hiding
issues permanently, etc.), transparency (after a delay) is the only
way to show that it is not.  Anyway, 30 days seems appropriate.

Best wishes,
