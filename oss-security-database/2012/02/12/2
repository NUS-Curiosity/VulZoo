Page http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/files/webcalendar%201.2/ lists 1.2.4 version. I have no idea why the other page doesn't list it at all. No reply to bug-report: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3472745&group_id=3870&atid=103870 and only thing I found strange in the report is "Version: 1.2.5" as there isn't such available. I can verify this advisory if you want.
