Subject: CVE request: init script x11-common creates directories in
	insecure manners

Hi,

I've reported a small vulnerability to Debian.  Due to an insecure file
creation, a local user can gain root privileges right after the 
"x11-common" service is started.

  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=661627

Could you allocate CVE id for this issue?

Thank you,
vladz.
