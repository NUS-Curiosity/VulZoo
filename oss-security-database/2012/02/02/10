Subject: Re: XSS hiding CSRF (was: Re: Mibew messenger multiple XSS)

I agree with you, this issues should have been categorized as CSRF. I had this doubt when reporting them and i decide to consider them XSS for one main reason: even with a CSRF protection an operator is still able to inject javascript into visitor's browser (ie an operator sets chat title to XSS and it gets executed when new visitor opens a chat). But propably you are rignt, there is no gain for an admin to exploit this and, for sure you are right, a password reset has a bigger impact.

It's standard operating procedure - and has been for many years - to particularly pay attention to these "XSS hiding CSRF" cases. For that reason you'll often see discrepancies in the original report and the released Secunia advisories.

However, via the CSRF vector it can be exploited by non-admins. This is why the Secunia advisory is rated as CSRF (like the OSVDB advisory) and just mentions XSS as a follow-up impact (along with alternatively just changing the administrator's password and gain full access that way).

We encounter these "XSS hiding CSRF" cases on a weekly basis.
