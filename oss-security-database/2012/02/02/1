Against the certainty that the end of the embargo brings, so we're
putting a potential risk (rediscovery/etc.) against a guarented risk
(details will become available when the embargo ends. I'm not claiming
to know which is better but I think two weeks is already pretty short,
reducing that to say a week only saves 7 days but potentially increases
workload 100% or more (we have half as much time to deal with it).

I think the shortened embargo time is rapidly approaching the limit of
maximum benefit (that is balancing time to fix against the chance of it
becoming public and putting systems/people at risk). Personally I think
hard rules are not a good idea here, I would support guidelines that
have some flexibility, not all cases are the same.

I don't have the data handy but I know most Linux vendors are now
responding to 500-1000 security issues per year and getting the majority
of them fixed by the time the issue goes public or very shortly
thereafter, I'm not sure we can speed this up much (this works tends to
be highly serialized, find the bug, assess the bug, fix the bug, QA the
software, etc.).

Also I haven't really seen any cases in the open source world of a leak
of information leading to widespread exploitation/problems (and if there
have been I'd love to know).
