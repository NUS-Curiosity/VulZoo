This means vendors will be keeping information about the vulnerability
private until they are confident they are able to release within a week,
at which point they will then share the information with other vendors
who will scramble to get their updates ready.

As a distro, I now have two choices: I sit on vulnerabilities until our
own QA and testing is done, at which point I send them to the list and
hope that 7 days is enough for everyone else, or I simply stop using the
list for anything that's more than trivial and contact other vendors
directly.

Yes, those are two excellent examples of basically one line fixes where
a week was sufficient to publish updates. I don't think they should be
used as a reference to determine what an acceptable delay is.

For us, 7-11 is too short for certain complexe issues. 14-19 is a
reasonable delay to backport patches, perform adequate QA and publish.

Or, they have waited until they were ready before telling everyone else
about it simply to adhere to the new list rules.

This will result in issues becoming public before everyone's updates are
ready to be published, nothing more.
