Is the patch

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=556619

really correct?  It does not strip the two magic characters "=
(" should be enough, = is just defensive), so it's probably still
possible to inject an onmouseover handler and CSS which enlarges the
affected HTML element so that the handler is practically guaranteed to
fire.

I've just looked at the patch, I haven't got a (patched or unpatched)
smokeping instance to test this.
