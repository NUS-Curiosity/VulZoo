Subject: Re: running the distros lists

I got a couple of off-list requests to clarify what kind of help is
needed.  I'll do so below:

What I'd like to be happening is for some list member(s) (not too many
of them) to be proposing a CRD for each reported issue on the day it is
reported.  Then those member(s) need to stay on top of all open issues
and ensure the CRDs are met (if necessary, adjusting the CRDs as long as
the list's limit permits).  Quite often, this will involve negotiations
with other list members, with the reporter, with upstream(s), and with
various other parties (such as related projects and distros who are not
on the list).  Yes, this does sound CERT'ish. ;-)

Not exactly anyone else, but anyone who is currently on the distros list.
