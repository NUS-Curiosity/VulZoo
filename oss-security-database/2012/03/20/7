To quote Steven on a previous issue:

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q1/177

===================
In this case, the product's security feature is not living up to its
advertised capability (by generating shorter passwords than expected)
so, even if it's not that severe an issue, it's probably still of some
importance to some people.
===================

in this case replace "shorter passwords" with "random addresses that are
not random".
