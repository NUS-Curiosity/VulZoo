Huh?

http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/371-20111002-core-information-disclosure.html

and

http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/371-20111002-core-information-disclosure.html

are entirely different issues (one is "Weak encryption causes potential
information disclosure" the other is "Inadequate error checking causes
potential information disclosure."), so two issues, two CVE's. We split
based on (among other things) the underlying issues, not the outcome.

These two CVE's are fine.
