Subject: CVE-request: Joomla core information disclosure 372-20111003

After discussion with Kurt we decided these three issues need own CVE-identifiers:

http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/370-20111001-core-information-disclosure (CVE-2011-3629)
http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/371-20111002-core-information-disclosure (CVE-2011-4937)
http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/372-20111003-core-information-disclosure

These all were previously refered as CVE-2011-3629. Now I need CVE-identifier for 372-20111003, which should be 2011. I can email about these to MITRE after assignment to get these updates in CVE-list:
