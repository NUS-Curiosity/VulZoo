Subject: CVE-Request taglib vulnerabilities

Hello,

Multiple bugs were found and reported in taglib, and have been patched. Out
of the 4 reported, 2 were patched recently while 2 only affected taglib
versions upto 1.7 and not the current development head at github.The
discussion at the taglib mailing list can be viewed here at [1].

Kindly assign CVE's for the same.

Thanks,
Zubin Mithra
