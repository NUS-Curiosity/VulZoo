Subject: CVE-request: systemd local denial of login or local users can
 create arbitrary services

Can I get CVE-identifier for this issue? http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=662029

Version: 37-1
Forwarded: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=680122

By invoking systemctl status somename.service any user can create an
entry in systemd's service list. If this list gets too large the login
procedure can fail. It is not tracked which user created the entries.

Thanks to Michael Biebl for helping me understand the issue. Lennart
Poettering later explained that the issue is already known and fixed in
git commit 9a46fc3b9014de1bf0ed1f3004a536b08a19ebb3.
