Is "VS@" supposed to be vendor-sec; the defunct list? Or is there another
list I am not aware of? If so, can you please give me the *full* address?
Thanks.

I'd say you may want to coordinate that documentation with Steve Christy as
the nine times he allocated CVEs for me directly, this sort of conversation
never came up. I can understand frustration on your part that people may
not be educated, but realize that if CNAs handle this process differently,
it may not be a matter of education on how 'the system works' but rather
consistency within the entire process, agnostic of whom is allocating a CVE.

I again, do appreciate your time but I suppose I'll just wait for Steve or
whomever is manning cve@...re to contact me back.

Best,
