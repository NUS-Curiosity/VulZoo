Subject: Re: CVE Requests

#1,2,3 are all included

#4, each project is linked to where the code (both vulnerable and/or fixed)
lives

#5...
phpMoneyBooks, 1.0.2 and potentially prior versions
phpGradeBook, 1.9.4 and potentially prior versions
phpPaleo, 4.8b155 and potentially prior versions
hbportal, 0.1 and potentially prior versions
eticketing, no version numbering used *shrug*

#6 An e-mail was sent to cve@...re.org 7 days ago without response
#7 All open source
#8 Not embargoed

I think that should do it.
