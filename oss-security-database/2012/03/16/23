Uh no. Tracking these issues is critical and it happens across dozens,
and in some cases hundreds of vendors (e.g. CVE-2009-3555).

If only it were that simple. Having worked for iSIGHT/iDefense prior to
Red Hat, and now at Red Hat, let me say this simply:

CVE Is 100% critical for security work at large scales.

Automated products/etc need reliable names for security issues.
Customers need reliable ways to ask questions (did you fix that OpenSSL
thing mentioned over in this random blog post? Oh you mean this CVE,
yes. etc.).
