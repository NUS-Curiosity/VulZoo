Thanks for the clarification.  Josh has in the past been very useful with 
OpenVAS and KDE bugs in particular where there is a security team who can take 
up most of the slack and handle the co-ordination process.  Hopefully we won't 
notice any changeover when we deal with you.

Totally agree about the information aspect FWIW, never had a problem sharing 
in the past - it's just a matter of minimising the friction when disclosing.

Cheers,
Tim

PS I suspect I'll be in touch sooner rather than later about CVEs, got a 
handful that are almost ready for disclosure.
