Subject: CVE-request: Drupal Finder SA-CONTRIB-2012-017

Can we assign CVE-identifier for this vulnerability http://drupal.org/node/1432970 (SA-CONTRIB-2012-017)?

Description
Finder is a Drupal module that allows users to create faceted search forms. The module's autocomplete, checkbox, and radio button functionalities previously did not sanitize the output of fields and raw database values.

In addition, users with the "administer finder" permission were able to execute arbitrary code through a PHP import interface; specific PHP execution permissions were not required.Updated: This issue affected only the 7.x branch of code. The 6.x branch used the permission "administer finder PHP settings" which is sufficiently clear that it allows execution of PHP code.

Versions affected
Finder 6.x-1.x prior to 6.x-1.26
Finder 7.x-1.x versions (all)
Finder 7.x-2.x versions prior to 7.x-2.0-alpha8
Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the contributed Finder module, there is nothing you need to do.

Project: Finder (third-party module)
Date: 2012-February-08
Security risk: Moderately critical
Exploitable from: Remote
Vulnerability: Cross Site Scripting, Arbitrary PHP code execution, Multiple vulnerabilities
