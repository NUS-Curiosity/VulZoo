In which case you can ask for them on VS@ list where the issue will
remain embargoed. If the issue is so sensitive you cannot leak
details/etc then you need to contact Mitre directly (this will also
ensure no duplicates/etc.).

Yes and I need to finish documenting this stuff (it's become obvious we
