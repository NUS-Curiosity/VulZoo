Subject: Re: [security] Drupal CORE and Drupal Contrib

Hi Kurt,

We started considering associating CVEs with our Security Advisories
(SAs) in September of 2011. At the time we discussed it with Josh
Bressers, Jan Lieskovsky, Steven M. Christey and decided that it would
only be practical to do it for Drupal core for now and we could
considering doing it for contrib in the future. Since that discussion
there has only been one SA for Drupal core which I think has the CVEs
on it: SA-CORE-2012-001 - Drupal core multiple vulnerabilities -
http://drupal.org/node/1425084

Is there another SA for core that I'm not considering? Is there a
better way to list the CVE numbers?

There have been several SAs for contributed modules and we would
gladly update them with CVEs. If you can send an email with a link to
the SA and the CVE-id to use that would be great.

Our biggest problem with trying to integrate CVE values to the SAs for
contributed modules is that the contributed projects are all run by
individual volunteers and we don't reliably know the date we are going
to release those. My understanding is that we can ask for a 2 week
embargo on CVE requests and that would work most of the time but not
all. We're working to improve the predictability of this process, but
I think it's too early to consider getting CVE's in advance.

Thanks,
Greg
