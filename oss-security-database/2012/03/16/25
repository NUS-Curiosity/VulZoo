You may have uh noticed me assigning 200+ cve's in the last few
months. I took over for Josh. I am unwilling to public assign CVE's
that are likely to end up with duplicates (e.g. no information CVE's
already sent in as a request to Mitre).

I am quite happy to assign "secret" or whatever you want to call them
CVE's (I do it all the time on linux-distros list for embargoed
issues) but I'm also trying to avoid duplicates and other messes. If
the issue is so secret you can't even give me a version #, brief
description, etc. than chances are Mitre needs to handle it.

I'm asking for pretty basic info like version #'s affected and ideally
fixed if you got it. This doesn't need to be complicated.
