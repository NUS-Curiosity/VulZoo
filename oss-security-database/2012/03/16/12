Those mails are all exemplary requests for CVE id's, ofcourse, but the
fact that they are all already fixed and released means that 100% of
the work is already done. At that point, assigning a CVE id is mostly
useless and is done as a "just for the record" thing.

The need for unified identifier for a particular issue is greatest
when discussing the problem and its potential solutions; Not how
someone actually solved it after it's already done. If CVE is to become
a thing for changelogs only, all those projects that don't use one
but rely on commit-messages instead won't use CVE id's at all, and the
usefulness of the CVE database dwindles.

Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and
terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
