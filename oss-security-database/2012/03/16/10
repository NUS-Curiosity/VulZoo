Subject: CVE Request -- Asterisk: AST-2012-002 and AST-2012-003 flaws

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

1) AST-2012-002:

An out-of stack-based buffer write flaw was found in the way the Miliwatt
application of the Asterisk, open source telephony toolkit, performed
generation of constant audio tone at 1000Hz (the 'o' option) from certain,
provided audio packets, when the 'internal_timing' Asterisk configuration file
option was disabled. In this configuration, a remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted audio packet file, which once processed by the Miliwatt
application would lead to that application crash, or, potentially arbitrary
code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.

2) AST-2012-003:

A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Asterisk Manager
Interface of Asterisk, open source telephony toolkit, performed processing of
certain HTTP Digest Authentication headers. A remote attacker, attempting to
connect to the HTTP session could send a HTTP Digest Authentication header with
specially-crafted values for certain fields, which once processed by the
Asterisk parse digest authorization header functionality would lead to asterisk
crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
running the application.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
