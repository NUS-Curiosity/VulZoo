Subject: CVE for OpenBSD random() bug?

https://banu.com/blog/42/openbsd-bug-in-the-random-function/

http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libc/stdlib/random.c#rev1.16

Fix a bug where random() always returns 0 when srandom() is seeded
with 0.  Use 1 and not 0 as the first element of the state array,
similar to what glibc does.  OK nicm@

It would seem this fits into the "weaker then advertised" class of
security problem. Thoughts/comments (anyone strongly against this)?
