The issues which were present in the development head were :-

[1] A crafted ogg file with sampleRate as "0" leads to crash in the
application using taglib.
         fixed in the commit -
https://github.com/taglib/taglib/commit/77d61c6eca4d08b9b025738acf6b926cc750db23
[2] "vendorLength" field modification in ogg tag parsing causes crash in
the application using taglib.
         fixed in the commit -
https://github.com/taglib/taglib/commit/ab8a0ee8937256311e649a88e8ddd7c7f870ad59


The issues which are present in the latest "release" but not in the current
development head were :-

[3] Lack of sanity checks of fields which were read, and were used for
allocating memory; crafted files would lead of application crash.
[4] A one bit change in a working ogg file would cause a thread to loop
infinitely.

*Please note* :-

[1] and [2] were fixed after the report, and could be assigned CVE's.

I am unsure about the other two, as they were fixed in the development
branch, prior to our report. However, a release has not been made with the
patches for [3] and [4] yet. Kindly assign CVE's for [3] and [4] if you see
it fit to do so.
