Subject: CVE request: Two Pidgin crashes

Hello hello.  Could I request that two CVEs be issued for two separate
crashes in Pidgin?  To my knowledge no CVE exists for either issue.
Both issues were reported in our public bug tracker, and are therefore
public.

The issues are described at the following two URLs:
http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=60
http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=61

The Pidgin project has just released version 2.10.2 which fixes both issues.

Thanks,
Mark
