Subject: CVE-2010 Request: quake3 / openarena-server: DDoS by processing 'getstatus'
 and 'rcon' packets

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   yet in 2010 the following problem has been corrected in Quake3 / OpenArena:

   A distributed denial of service flaw was found in the way Quake3 Arena /
OpenArena servers used to handle 'getstatus' and 'rcon' (remote command)
connectionless requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform
distributed denial of service attack against the target server IP gameserver by
spoofing certain packets.

       http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=quake3

       mentions various Quake3 related security flaws, but doesn't
       this concrete issue yet.
