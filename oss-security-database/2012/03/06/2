Subject: CVE-request: phxEventManager search.php search_terms Parameter SQL
 Injection

Can we assign 2012 CVE-identifier for this vulnerability?

http://www.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/79738

"phxEventManager contains a flaw that may allow an attacker to carry out an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the search.php script not properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the 'search_terms' parameter. This may allow an attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data."
