Sorry, slowly catching up on mails here.

Whether that is right or wrong, I'm not 100% sure; you'd have to ask
upstream.  I just did the diff since I couldn't find a svn/git repo web
interface to generate a patch, so if it's wrong, then upstream has got
it wrong as well.

I see that Fedora has used a patch (not sure if it's the same or not),
so if I get a chance in the next few days I'll try the new version to
try to validate the fix.
