Their code bases may differ significantly in other parts, but it seems
the affected vulnerable code is still identical between the two.
Following are versions shortly before fixes got committed:

http://torcs.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/torcs/torcs/torcs/src/modules/graphic/ssggraph/grsound.cpp?revision=1.31.2.2&view=markup
http://speed-dreams.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/speed-dreams/trunk/src/modules/graphic/ssggraph/grsound.cpp?revision=4146&view=markup

In cases like this, same CVE is used for all project that use / embed
the same affected code.
