Note that additional similar issue in mime_param_cmp was fixed in
0.9.8u and 1.0.0h as:
  http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=22252

This can also be triggered by malformed S/MIME message.

The above commit also corrects an issue with the previous mime_hdr_cmp
fix that could cause the function to return either "less than" or
"greater than" when comparing NULL to non-NULL.  There's no known
security impact of this change, it seems it could cause verification /
decryption to fail when it can succeed. Reported by "bla".
