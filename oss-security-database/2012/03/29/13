It works.  I have used it for enumerating the e164.arpa tree, which
has a similarly regular structure, too, and for finding TLDs which
have redirected second level domains on ISC's Dnschanger replacement
name servers.

Reverse delegation is still not fully solved with IPv6 (and will
probably never be), so non-synthetic answers will be rare.
Particularly for anything which doesn't speak SMTP.

If you want to use DNS to facility IPv6 scanning, you probably should
store every AAAA you see in a database.
