Ok starting with core:

http://drupal.org/node/1231510
SA-CORE-2011-003 - Drupal core - Access bypass
This was already assigned CVE-2011-2726

http://drupal.org/node/1204582
SA-CORE-2011-002 - Drupal core - Access bypass
This was already assigned CVE-2011-2687

http://drupal.org/node/1168756
SA-CORE-2011-001 - Drupal core - Multiple vulnerabilities
Can't find any CVE's, do they need to be assigned?
