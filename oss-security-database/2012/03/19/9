Please use CVE-2012-1561 for this issue.

> Description
> Finder is a Drupal module that allows users to create faceted search forms. The module's autocomplete, checkbox, and radio button functionalities previously did not sanitize the output of fields and raw database values.

> In addition, users with the "administer finder" permission were able to execute arbitrary code through a PHP import interface; specific PHP execution permissions were not required.Updated: This issue affected only the 7.x branch of code. The 6.x branch used the permission "administer finder PHP settings" which is sufficiently clear that it allows execution of PHP code.
