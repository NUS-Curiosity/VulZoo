Subject: CVE request for bitlebee

A few months ago it was reported that Bitlbee did not drop extra
groups(in unix.c) that the process launching it had.
There hasn't been a CVE assigned to this issue, so I thought I would
follow up and request one.
The original report can be found at
http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/ticket/852 and it was fixed in
http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/changeset/devel%2C856.
