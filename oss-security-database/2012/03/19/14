Please use CVE-2012-1566 for this issue

>Secondly a temporary file creation flaw in mintUpdate:
>
>https://github.com/linuxmint/mintupdate/blob/master/usr/lib/linuxmint/mintUpdate/mintUpdate.py#L1444

Please use CVE-2012-1567 for this issue.

Also a note on fixing these issues:

Python

Simply use “mkstemp” from the “tempfile” module:

http://docs.python.org/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mkstemp

I tried to find a LinuxMint security contact, nothing on the website
(e.g. http://www.linuxmint.com/teams.php), someone suggested
root@...uxmint.com, here's hoping they see it.
