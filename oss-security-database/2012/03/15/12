I guess you meant to place a comma after "No".

I think we should place these on the wiki.  There's already a wiki page
on CVE IDs, but it is very brief and it does not mention obtaining CVE
IDs via oss-security or distros lists.  You could want to update it and
add links to it from other relevant oss-security wiki pages.
