Part of it also depends on usage. Google labels everything as a Beta,
sometimes for years and with millions of users. My experience is a lot
of people use Debian unstable (when I used Debian I did, otherwise
everything was to boring =). What would be interesting is if you could
provide download statistics from the main site. I know for a fact
CVE's have been assigned for publicly released applications that are
probably in use by less than 100 or in extreme cases possibly less
than 10 people globally.
