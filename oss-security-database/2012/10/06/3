Subject: CVE-request for piwigo issues (second request)

Hello,

Old CVE-request did not get filled. At least the CVE is not listed in Mitre's list, OSVDB, Secunia or Debian security-tracker. Request done in: http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/12/07/1

"""
piwigo:
a1) CSRF
a2) SQL injection
a3) stored XSS
http://secunia.com/advisories/41365/
http://piwigo.org/releases/2.1.3
http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/14973/
(the issues mentioned by the exploit-db entry appear to be the same that 
were fixed in 2.1.3)
b) search.php SQL injection
http://secunia.com/advisories/38305/
http://piwigo.org/releases/2.0.8
c) CSRF in the admin panel:

free to assign or ignore those.)
