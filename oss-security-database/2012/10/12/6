Subject: CVE request: ruby file creation due in insertion of illegal NUL
 character

Just noticed this today on ruby's web site:

http://preview.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2012/10/12/poisoned-NUL-byte-vulnerability/

The fix is located here:

http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=37163

I don't see a CVE name associated with the announcement or commit, so
I don't believe one has been assigned.
