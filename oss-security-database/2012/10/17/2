At least for Perl I consider this a feature.

The NUL byte is a special character and allows trailing white
space in the filename that is otherwise stripped. This is
(more or less) documented in perlopentut(1).

It also seems unlikely that someone adds NUL bytes to the
white list of acceptable characters by accident, and if there
is no white list in the first place, the Perl script probably
has bigger issues.
