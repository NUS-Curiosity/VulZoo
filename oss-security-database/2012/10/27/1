On FreeBSD

on amd64: typedef __uint64_t __size_t;
on i386 I believe __size_t is __unit32_t;

Since memset takes a size_t (typedefed of __size_t) a negative number
would either be optimized out or turned into a large positive number.
As such there is no negative offset or negative jump.

and such  we are not vulnerable.

Is this correct or am I missing something?
