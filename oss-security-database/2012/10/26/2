Subject: Medium severity flaw with Perl 5

I recently discovered that Perl 5 interpreter is vulnerable to memory 
corruption when large values are supplied to the x operator.

After discussions with the vendor, CVE-2012-5195 was assigned to this 
vulnerability.

I know Red Hat and Debian have picked it up, but I'm not sure about other 
vendors.
