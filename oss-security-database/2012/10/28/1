Subject: CVE Request: cgit command injection

Hi Kurt,

>From http://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/commit/?id=7ea35f9f8ecf61ab42be9947aae1176ab6e089bd
:

"syntax-highlighting.sh: Fix command injection.

By not quoting the argument, an attacker with the ability to add files
to the repository could pass arbitrary arguments to the highlight
command, in particular, the --plug-in argument which can lead to
arbitrary command execution.

This patch adds simple argument quoting."


The vulnerable script is not a hard requirement and is more in the
"contrib" variety of things. That said, lots of users do wind up using
it verbatim, as it's simple and works well, so this does affect a
decent number of folks.

The patch for it will be released in the upcoming cgit release, along
with the previous CVE for that buffer overflow. I'll send the list an
update when that release is made.


Thanks,
Jason
