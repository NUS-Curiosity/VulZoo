Subject: CVE request: use-after-free in libunity-webapps

Hi,

libunity-webapps provides functionality shared between browser addons 
that are available for Firefox and Chromium. A use-after-free bug was 
found in libunity-webapps which could potentially be exploited to crash 
the users browser or run arbitrary code.

Reference:

Could you please allocate a CVE for this?

Thanks,
Chris
