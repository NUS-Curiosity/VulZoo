No, my fault, sorry about that - I misread it.  No new CVE needed.  Using 
Agostino's original request, Item 1 from SECUNIA:47494 is the same as 
Wireshark item 2 (wnpa-sec-2012-02.html) as listed later in Agostino's 
request, to which you had already assigned CVE-2012-0042.  I originally 
read this like there were separate requests, and I missed that there were 
overlapping references that talked about the same issue.
