Subject: Mibew messenger multiple XSS

This seems to need 2012 CVE-identifier.

Advisory: http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2012/Jan/177
Codseq own advisory: http://www.codseq.it/advisories/mibew_messenger_multiple_xss
OSVDB: http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/78663
Secunia: http://secunia.com/advisories/47787/

At the moment http://mibew.org/ does not work for me.
