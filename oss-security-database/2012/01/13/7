Ok I'm still not clear on what the security claim is. Are you saying you
can cause arbitrary text output via XSL/XML mangling tricks? And
combined with having a script that uses something like "<sax:output
href="0wn3d.php" method="text">" you can put arbitrary text content into
this file which could then result in the file being parsed? The problem
is you'd have to write a script that does this, writes to a local file
with a file ending in .php or .shtml or whatever, in which case it's
pretty clear the script writer MEANT to do that. Again I'm still not
clear on what/how a security boundary is being crossed. How does this
elevate privileges or give you remote access that you wouldn't already
if you can upload arbitrary PHP scripts?
