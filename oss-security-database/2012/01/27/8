That was my question, in fact. Are separate keys (to the same user
account on the box) really supposed to be considered separate accounts
(on the box).

My first guess is “yes”, but I'm not sure if it was created like that,
and thus think it was a valid question. For the sshd, you don't (may
not) have three separate accounts, but one.
