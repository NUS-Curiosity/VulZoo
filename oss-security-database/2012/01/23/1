To make any sensible decision on this, I think you have to assume
every week of the year as having at least 4 business days (even
xmas/new years).  Any regions or religious organizations that have
multi-day holidays will either be out of luck or should have at least
one person reading their mail 4 days out of the holiday week.

Best wishes,
