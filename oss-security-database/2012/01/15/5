Note that I tried to contact Ryan Boren and wp-hackers to get
information about CVE-2011-3122, 3125, 3128 and 3129 but didn't get any
answer either (for the later the mail doesn't even appear on the
archives so I guess it was not moderated, but afaict I didn't receive a
bounce either). It seems that the security contact point is security
[at] automattic.com so maybe try that?
