Subject: New Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset

Hello,

The Information Security Centre of Excellence (ISCX) 2012 intrusion
detection evaluation dataset consists of labeled network traces, including full
packet payloads, which along with the relevant profiles are publicly
available to researchers by applying at http://iscx.ca/dataset-request-form.
A full description of the evaluation dataset can also be found at
http://www.iscx.ca/datasets. A brief abstract of the fundamental ideas
behind the dataset is also attached below. A complete blog post is
also accessible at http://ali.shiravi.com/84.

Thank you,

Hadi Shiravi
