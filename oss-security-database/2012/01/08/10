As far as publicly known, it's likely that Stuxnet was originally
spread via a security problem with USB.

Also, I'd doubt the "physical access" category. It may just require a
bit of social engineering ("I have the file you requested on this usb
stick").

Considering that I'd strongly disagree classifying such issues "low
impact".

At least for pluggable devices, I'd consider such issues rather
serious. It's another thing with PCI or other devices that require
significant work to attach to a piece of hardware.
