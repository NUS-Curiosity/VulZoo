Subject: CVE-2012-0207 kernel: igmp: Avoid zero delay when receiving odd mixture
 of IGMP queries

Commit 5b7c84066733c5dfb0e4016d939757b38de189e4 ('ipv4: correct IGMP
behavior on v3 query during v2-compatibility mode') added yet another
case for query parsing, which can result in max_delay = 0.  Substitute
a value of 1, as in the usual v3 case.
