Subject: Potential security issues fixed in PHP 5.3.9

Hi, in addition to the xslt arbitrary file creation) there are some more potential security vulnerabilities that appear to have been fixed in 5.3.9. Can you confirm if these are not security issues? Also will you need CVE assignments for the ones that are (I can help with that).

Sending to security@....net again and cc'ing oss-sec in case anyone on the list has ideas/comments.

>From the ChangeLog:
