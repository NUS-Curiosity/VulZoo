You don't need to write it "to me".  If you have further questions you'd
like to ask or things to clarify on this mailing list, then you will in
fact need to explain what you're doing in more detail.  Otherwise, you
probably don't need to.  But like I said you may want to specify your
threat model in your web app's documentation either way.
