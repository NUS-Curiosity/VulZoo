Subject: gpw password generator giving short password at low rate

Hi list,

we were pointed at a bug in gpw (a password generator), which makes it
generate shorter password than required at a rate of ~20 over 1 million.
The bug is at http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=651510
(so already public) and I'm wondering if that deserves a CVE:

* gpw seems unmaintained (upstream and in Debian since around 2006)
* I'm not sure people even use it
* people using it interactively will notice the password has the wrong
size

But as it may be used in a script, then it might still be a real issue.

What do people think?

Regards,
