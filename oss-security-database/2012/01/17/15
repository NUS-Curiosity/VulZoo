For CVE, if there is an insecure feature that is documented, but there are 
likely or proven scenarios in which an admin might be unaware of the 
insecurity of the feature, then we will often consider it for inclusion. 
In this case, we would write the CVE description in a way that emphasizes 
the admin's role in creating/introducing the issue.

A separate reason for inclusion would be if a product advertises a 
security feature, but the implementation does not achieve the claimed 
level of security.
