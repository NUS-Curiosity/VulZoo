I'm of the mind that documenting issues is good but documenting issues
doesn't always make them go away.

E.g. documenting a default usrname/password where it can be easily
changed is reasonable. Documenting a default username/password that
cannot be changed doesn't really help to the same degree.

In this case we have something that tells you not to use an unsafe
option but isn't exceedingly noticeable or clear (if it came up every
time you used that option there would be a stringer case for no CVE).
I'm sitting on the fence for this one (I can see it going either way),
wouldn't mind some more opinions from the smart people on this list.
