Subject: Re: gpw password generator giving short password at
 low rate


The rarity of an issue does not affect CVE inclusion.

In this case, the product's security feature is not living up to its 
advertised capability (by generating shorter passwords than expected) so, 
even if it's not that severe an issue, it's probably still of some 
importance to some people.

The availability of the software does not directly affect CVE inclusion; 
if it could be available for people to install on their own systems, then 
it can be covered by CVE.  Obviously this applies to any software that is 
available for download from the web, whether open or closed source.  (I 
say "does not directly affect CVE inclusion" because CVE cannot keep up 
with every single product and every single vulnerability due to various 
limitations - primarily the raw number of vulns that are released every 
year - so, some products with limited "market share" might not make it 
into CVE even though they would technically qualify.)
