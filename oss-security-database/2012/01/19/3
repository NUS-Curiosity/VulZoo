Subject: CVE request: tucan insecure plugin update mechanism

Saw a Debian bug report about tucan and how it insecurely handles
"plugin" updates (which are basically python scripts).  These "plugins"
are executed with the privileges of the user running tucan, and because
there is no authenticity checking (plugins are not signed, doesn't look
like there are any certificate checks when connecting to the update
server, etc.), it's prone to MITM attacks where an attacker could
basically run arbitrary code as the user running tucan.

I'm not sure how popular this program is or how widely used, but this is
definitely not good design.

(I'm cc'ing who I hope is one of the lead developers, although it
doesn't look like much development has been done in the last year)
