As a temporary solution, I've found that commenting lines 44-49 in
/usr/share/X11/xkb/compat/xfree86 (actual location may vary for your
distro; mine is a debian system), which are

    interpret XF86_Ungrab {
        action = Private(type=0x86, data="Ungrab");
    };
    interpret XF86_ClearGrab {
        action = Private(type=0x86, data="ClsGrb");
    };

and running "setxkbmap $(setxkbmap -query | grep layout | awk '{print
$2}')" solves the problem.

Best wishes,
Mike
