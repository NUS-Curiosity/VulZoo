Subject: CVE request: usbmuxd 1.0.7 "receive_packet()" Buffer Overflow Vulnerability

rigan has reported a vulnerability in usbmuxd, which potentially can be
exploited by malicious people with physical access to compromise a
vulnerable system.

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error within the
"receive_packet()" function (libusbmuxd/libusbmuxd.c) when processing a
property list containing an overly long "SerialNumber" field, which can
be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow.

Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code, but
requires that the attacker is able to connect a malicious USB device.
