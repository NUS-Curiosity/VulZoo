The former. The CVE-2010-1104 issue was applicable to Zope3 too (just wasn't
described in the description). The reason probably being the CVE-2010-1104
to had been reported against Zope2 version only (according to particular
LaunchPad bug).

Zope2 patch for CVE-2010-1104 was incomplete (still allowing XSS). Not sure,
if there was some Zope3 patch for CVE-2010-1104 applied.

Jan-Wijbrand Kolman could you clarify and help us to understand original
CVE-2010-1104 situation in Zope3?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
