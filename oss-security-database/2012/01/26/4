To me that looks OK, but I just asked IF there is already CVEs assigned to these security vulnerabilities or not. I don't know if Joomla has requested identifiers from MITRE or done it via oCERT for example. Advisories, which are at the moment just oneliners in their webpage do not at least list any CVE-identifiers.
