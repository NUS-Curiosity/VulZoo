Thank you for the identifiers. Descriptions are switched.

4610 CVE-2003-1598 is about blog.header.php posts variable SQL injection
4611 CVE-2003-1599 is about links.all.php abspath variable RFI

OSVDB already added these to the advisories, but that can be easily fixed. In future I can add files affected and correct parameters to these requests for clarity. Sorry for the confusion, but could you tell me which CVE should be used for which vulnerability?
