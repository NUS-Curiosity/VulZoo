We have released an update for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6,
https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0052.html.

Please update the kernel as soon as possible.

PS: On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, /bin/su (coreutils) and
/usr/bin/gpasswd (shadow-utils) are protected at compile time by PIE.

Thanks, Eugene
