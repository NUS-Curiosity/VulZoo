Subject: CVE Request: cobbler (Ubuntu-specific)

Could we please get a CVE assigned to the following issue?:

A Ubuntu-specific script called "cobbler-ubuntu-import" in the Ubuntu
cobbler package downloads isos from a mirror, and checks them against
MD5SUMS, but does not verify the validity of that MD5SUMS file itself
against the MD5SUMS.gpg. This was fixed in version 2.2.2-0ubuntu32 of
the package.

Bug:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cobbler/+bug/974460

Commit:
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-branches/ubuntu/precise/cobbler/precise/revision/98

Thanks,

Marc.
