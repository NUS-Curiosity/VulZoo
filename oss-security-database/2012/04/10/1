Subject: CVE id request for imagemagick, libpng and tiff

We received 3 bug reports targeting imagemagick, libpng and tiff crashing on 
input when used with electric fence indicating memory errors on handling 
crafted input. From what I see no CVE ids have been assigned to these bugs 
yet.

Can someone assign ids?
libpng: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668082
(apparently fixed in 1.2.48 with a removal of the buggy function)

tiff: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668087

imagemagick: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668075

Kind regards
Nico
