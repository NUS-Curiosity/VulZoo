I'll hold off on it then.

Hrmm yeah that's a tough one. Do you do any regression testing to make
sure the new modules don't break things (if people know stuff is
unlikely to break they are more likely to upgrade quickly, usually any
ways).

Perfect! I was just thinking, as long as the main project
contributors/etc. (e.g. you guys in the case of Drupal) do the CVE
requests in a regular and public way (e.g. to OSS-sec) than there is
minimal chance of duplicates and other problems (e.g. someone else
sending a request to Mitre directly or whatever).
