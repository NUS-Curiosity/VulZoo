Subject: CVE request: cobbler lack of csrf protection, code execution

Hi, I reported some bugs a while ago in cobbler which never received
CVE ID, could the follow bugs receive CVE ID ?
1. lack of csrf protection in the cobbler web interface (vulnerable to
csrf attacks) https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/+source/cobbler/+bug/858878
2. code execution on the cobbler host through use of yaml.loads on
potentially untrusted user input
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/oneiric/+source/cobbler/+bug/858883

Thank you.
