With "'" as input to select_sort:

You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '\\\' asc' at line 1select * from posts where parent_post_id IS NULL AND status=1 AND user_id=0 AND (post LIKE '%foo%' OR title LIKE '%foo%') and status IN (1) order by \\\' asc

My friend told me that this can escalate in case of bad permissions or bad MySQL setup, but I do not have better PoC for this list. At least one can't chain for example SELECT foo FROM bar;DROP TABLE users;--
