Subject: CVE Request: slock-0.9 displays modal box after locking

From: https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=401645

If any program makes a modal dialog box while the screen is
black/controls locked with slock, and then some buttons are pressed on
the keyboard, the screen is unblackened, and everything is visible on
the desktop you locked on.

Steps to reproduce:
1. sleep 3; pcmanfm
2. slock
3. press some buttons
4. now black screen will go away and you can see the current active desktop

This is a critical vulnerability. I recommend blocking this package.

I'm running xmonad on amd64.

You need to run the other program *concurrently*. I'll try and make the
reproduction steps clearer:

1. run sleep <n>; <X-program>
2. lock the screen as fast as you can
3. make sure <n> seconds has passed, so that you know <X-program> has
started
4. press some keys (any keys (doesn't have to be your actual password),
don't hit enter)

Now the black screen will go away and you can see the current active
desktop along with <X-program>.

Where <X-program> is the name of some X program that will create a
window and leave it open when executed, i.e: pcmanfm.
