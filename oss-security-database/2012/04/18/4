I am not that sure about the defaults, because I changed them. However
running a Munin without any plugins is pointless. It is like running a
mail server that does not transport any mail. You don't even have to
guess the name of a configured plugin, because those images are linked
from the html. Finding a configured plugin is really no issue on any
sane munin installation. Sane administrators may have to restricted
access to munin to themselves as to not expose the monitoring results to
the public though.
