Subject: CVE request: latex2man / texlive

Hi Kurt, Steve, vendors,

recently there has been an issue reported by Helmut Grohne in latex2man. It 
seems to be different from what we had the other day (CVE-2012-2093 [1]).
Bug report of the new issue is available at:

  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=668779

Does this qualify for a CVE? 

Thanks,
Matthias
