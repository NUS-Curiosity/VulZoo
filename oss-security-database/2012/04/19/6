Two issues in 3.1.1 are without 2011 CVE-identifiers, which are announced in here: http://wordpress.org/news/2011/04/wordpress-3-1-1/ (April 5, 2011).

Issue #1:

http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/72141
http://secunia.com/advisories/44038/

"Certain unspecified input is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site."

Issue #2:

http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/72142
http://secunia.com/advisories/44038/

"The "make_clickable()" function in wp-includes/formatting.php does not properly check the URL length in comments before passing it to the PCRE library, which can be exploited to cause a crash."

Both vulnerabilities are reported in versions prior to 3.1.1.
