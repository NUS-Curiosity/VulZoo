Subject: CVE request -- kernel: macvtap: zerocopy: vector length is not
 validated before pinning user pages

Currently we do not validate the vector length before calling
get_user_pages_fast(), host stack could be easily overflowed by
malicious guest driver who gives us a descriptors with length greater
than MAX_SKB_FRAGS.

A privileged guest user could use this flaw to induce stack overflow on
the host with attacker non-controlled data (some bits can be guessed, as
it will be pointers to kernel memory) but with attacker controlled
length.

Proposed fix thread:
