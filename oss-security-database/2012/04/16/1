Subject: CVE Requests: Multiple security flaws in csound5

Hi Folks,

Multiple security flaws were reported in csound5, details below.
Can CVE ids be please assigned to these issues?

1. Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow in pv_import
Reference:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=810802
http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2012-7/
There seems to be two patches for this issue. The earlier fix was
incomplete and a second patch had to be applied later.

2. Integer overflow leading to buffer overflow in lpc_import
Reference:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=810807
http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2012-6/
Though the commit date does not match up with the date described in the
secunia advisory, this is the only commit which seems to match the flaw
description.

3. Stack-based buffer overflow in lpc_import
Reference:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=810810
http://secunia.com/secunia_research/2012-4/


John, Can you please review the patches and let us know if they are
correct?

Thanks!
