Sure, no doubt about that. The postgresql-jdbc package should have been
updated a long time ago but obviously was forgotten. If we had updated
it a year ago we'd have created a normal version update due to EOL of
the old package with no security context at all. Now that it's known
that the unsupported combination of versions allows for SQL injection
however the update suddenly becomes security relevant.
