Hmm.

So we know what is holding the pid namespace reference.

Additional thoughts.

Does echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches clear up the issue?

Is there a corresponding task_struct leak?

Are the zombies getting reaped?

I don't have much of a clue or much concern as this seems fixed in later kernels but I am happy to suggest things to look for to help narrow this down.
