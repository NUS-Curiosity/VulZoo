Subject: Re: CVE-request: WordPress 3.1.1

I previously requested CVE-identifiers for two WordPress 3.1.1 issues (2011), which are still not assigned.

> 1) Certain unspecified input is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Hanno Böck said in http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q1/151 that CVE-2012-0287 is for this issue.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2012-0287
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0287
Phase: Assigned (20120103)
Category:
Reference: MISC:http://oldmanlab.blogspot.com/2012/01/wordpress-33-xss-vulnerability.html
Reference: CONFIRM:https://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/wordpress-3-3-1/
Reference: SECTRACK:1026542
Reference: URL:http://www.securitytracker.com/id?1026542

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in wp-comments-post.php in
WordPress 3.3.x before 3.3.1, when Internet Explorer is used, allows
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the query
string in a POST operation that is not properly handled by the
"Duplicate comment detected" feature.


Current Votes:
None (candidate not yet proposed)
======================================================

It seems to be assigned for 3.3.1 and not for 3.1.1. Sorry for my mistake also in last emails.

> 2) The "make_clickable()" function in wp-includes/formatting.php does not properly check the URL length in comments before passing it to the PCRE library, which can be exploited to cause a crash.

Still no CVE.

> I even contacted WordPress administrators and asked if this does have CVE, but they haven't replied for some reason.

Still no answer.

Can we now assign CVE-identifiers for 3.1.1 issues, thanks? List of issues in 3.1.1 can be found from here http://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&resolution=fixed&milestone=3.1.1&group=resolution&order=priority and related news article in here http://wordpress.org/news/2011/04/wordpress-3-1-1/
