I believe the XSS exists even without the backend. On review I'm less
confident the CSRF is in the module or the service.

We probably can't do this, though it is a fairly common request. Our
current policy is not to discuss the specific details for at least 2
weeks and closer to 6 months if possible. Project usage shows that
most site builders don't upgrade very quickly.

I didn't see an answer to my question about asking for CVE-identifier
on Wednesdays after the SAs are released. I assumed that would be
helpful so I just started doing that.

Thanks!
