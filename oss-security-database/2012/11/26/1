Subject: CVE Request: slowloris for tomcat

The old slowloris attack has CVE IDs for various affected platforms, but not for tomcat. My testing has shown that tomcat is indeed affected, and others [0] [1] back this up. Could we please get a CVE ID assigned for slowloris as it affects tomcat?

Thanks
