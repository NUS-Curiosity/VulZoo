Subject: CVE request: Curl insecure usage

Hi,
during the triage of the SSL client bugs spotted by the
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_ccs12.pdf paper
Debian developer Alessandro Ghedini discovered two more
applications using Curl in an insecure manner:

1. opendnssec (in the eppclient tool)
http://lists.opendnssec.org/pipermail/opendnssec-user/2012-November/002296.html

2. PHPcas (used by Moodle e.g.):
https://github.com/Jasig/phpCAS/pull/58

Please assign CVE IDs for these.

Cheers,
        Moritz
