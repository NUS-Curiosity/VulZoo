Also how do we confirm you are on the security team there? I can't
even find proof you work for Montavista (other than the email address)
and I can't find any mention of a person called "Premchand Koneru"
doing security work in the past.

I did manage to find a CVE page of sorts:

http://www.mvista.com/cve_vulnerabilities.php

For 2012 you appear to have fixed one Linux security flaw out of the 7
listed (the rest are OpenSSL/OpenSSH), so I'm not really sure why you
would need access to distros@ if you aren't fixing Linux related
security issues any ways?
