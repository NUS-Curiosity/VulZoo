Subject: RE: YUI 2.x security issue regarding embedded SWF
 files -- or, How Not To Handle A Security Disclosure

Sorry for the delay.

If a customer "owns" the systems or networks on which the software is installed, and/or is the entity who MUST take action to fix the issue, then it qualifies for a CVE.

If the fix for the issue is entirely in the hands of the vendor without any involvement by the consumer at all, then it does not get a CVE.  So, XSS on a custom web site, or a financial web site that exposes credentials, or a "typical" cloud-based offering, would generally not get a CVE.  (Note that this is a gap in the industry, as vulnerability databases in general don't cover "site-specific" or service-oriented issues.)

Based on the security-announcement-swf-vulnerability-in-yui-2 post, this requires users of YUI 2 to take certain actions for "Any project that hosts YUI 2 SWF files ...  on its own servers."  So, this qualifies for a CVE.

- Steve
