 vulnerability

                 Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-4536 / XSA-21
                                version 2

                    pirq range check DoS vulnerability

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

domain_pirq_to_emuirq() uses the guest provided pirq value before
range checking it, and physdev_unmap_pirq uses domain_pirq_to_emuirq
without checking the pirq value either.  Invalid pirq values can cause
Xen to read out of array bounds, usually resulting in a fatal page
fault.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to crash.  If the out of
array bounds access does not crash, the arbitrary value read will be
ignored due to later error checking, so there is no privilege
escalation and no exploitable information leak.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only Xen version 4.1 is vulnerable.  Other released versions, and
xen-unstable, are not vulnerable.

The vulnerability is only exposed to HVM guests.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests, or ensuring that HVM guests only use trusted
kernels, will avoid this vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

The attached patch resolves this issue.
