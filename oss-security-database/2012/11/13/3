                 Xen Security Advisory CVE-2012-4538 / XSA-23
                                version 2

                Unhooking empty PAE entries DoS vulnerability

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The HVMOP_pagetable_dying hypercall does not correctly check the
caller's pagetable state, leading to a hypervisor crash.

IMPACT
======

An HVM guest running on shadow pagetables (that is, not HAP) can
cause the hypervisor to crash.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions from 4.0 onwards are vulnerable, except that:
 - systems that run only PV guests are not vulnerable
 - systems that run all HVM guests using HAP (which is the default on
   hardware that supports it) are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be avoided by running only PV guests or by running
all HVM guests using hardware-assisited paging (HAP, also called
NPT, RVI and EPT).

Xen will run guests using HAP by default on hardware that
supports it, unless it is disbled by putting 'hap=0' either on
the xen hypervisor command-line or in the VM's configuration.

You can check whether a particular machine supports HAP by looking at
xen's boot messages.  On Xen 4.1, 4.2 and unstable, Xen will print
"HVM: Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP) detected" during boot; on xen 4.0
the message is "HVM: Hardware Assisted Paging detected".

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
