P.S.: No Red Hat bugzilla entry available, since this issue did not
      affect versions of IMP, as shipped with Fedora / Fedora EPEL.

P.S.#2: The other XSS from [1]:
      Calendar changes:
      * Fixed XSS issue in portal blocks.

      is already covered within my previous (Kronolith related) request.
