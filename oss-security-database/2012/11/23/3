Subject: CVE Request -- kronolith: Two sets (3.0.17 && 3.0.18) of XSS flaws

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  Horde upstream has recently released 3.0.18 version
of Kronolith, the Horde calendar application, correcting
one set of XSS flaws:
 [1] https://github.com/horde/horde/blob/d3dda2d47fad7eb128a0091e732cded0c2601009/kronolith/docs/CHANGES
 [2] http://lists.horde.org/archives/announce/2012/000836.html

more exactly:
* Set #1: [mms] SECURITY: Fix XSS vulnerabilities in the portal blocks.
  Upstream patch: http://git.horde.org/horde-git/-/commit/d865c564beb6e98532880aa51a04a79f3311cd1e
  References: [1], [2] plus [3] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=879684

Also previously (in version 3.0.17 yet another set of XSS flaws got corrected):
* Set #2: [jan] SECURITY: Fix XSS vulnerabilities in tasks view and search view (Bug #11189).  
  Upstream ticket: [4] http://bugs.horde.org/ticket/11189
  Upstream patch:  [5] http://git.horde.org/horde-git/-/commit/1228a6825a8dab3333d0a8c8986fc10d1f3d11b2
  References: [1], [2], [4], [5]
  Note: There isn't a Red Hat Bugzilla entry, since the kronolith 2.x
        version based versions shipped, within Fedora / Fedora EPEL weren't
        vulnerable to this problem yet.

Look at MITRE CVE database for kronolith:
[6] http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=kronolith

suggests the last security flaws, a CVE ids has been assigned to, were the
following two:
* v2.2-RC2
--------

[jan] SECURITY: Fix privilege escalation in Horde API. => CVE-2008-7218
[cjh] SECURITY: Fix missing ownership validation on share changes => CVE-2008-7219

so both of sets of the XSS issues (Set #1, Set #2) should still be lacking
(two) CVE identifiers.

Could you allocate them?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
