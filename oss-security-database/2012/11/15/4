Subject: CVE Request -- perl-CGI: Newline injection due to improper CRLF
 escaping in Set-Cookie and P3P headers

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  a security flaw was found in the way CGI.pm, a Perl module to
handle Common Gateway Interface requests and responses, performed
sanitization of values to be used for Set-Cookie and P3P headers.
If a Perl CGI.pm module based CGI application reused cookies values
and accepted untrusted input from web browser(s), a remote attacker
could use this flaw to in an unauthorized way alter member items of
the cookie or add new items.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
