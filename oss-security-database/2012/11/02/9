CVE assignment at MITRE attempts to distinguish between "disclosures"
and "rumors" although admittedly this is not 100% successful. In the
specific case you mentioned, if there's no maintainer relationship
between "I" and "product X" and no other available context, then no
CVE is assigned.

More generally, there are various cases in which exactly the same
statement would have a different CVE assignment decision depending on
whether the statement came from a vendor or other software maintainer.
This has been mentioned here before; for example, see
