Subject: CVE Request -- pgbouncer: DoS (pooler server shutdown) by adding
 database with large name

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  a denial of service flaw was found in the way pgbouncer,
a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL, performed
processing of client requests attempting to add new database(s)
with large name(s). A remote attacker could use this flaw
to cause pooler server shutdown.

Relevant upstream patch:
[1] http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=pgbouncer.git;a=commitdiff;h=4b92112b820830b30cd7bc91bef3dd8f35305525

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
