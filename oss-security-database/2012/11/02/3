Subject: libtiff: Missing return value check in ppm2tiff leading to heap-buffer
 overflow when reading a tiff file

Hi All,

A flaw was found in the way ppm2tiff, a tool to create a TIFF file from
PPM, PGM and PBM image files, did not check the return value of
TIFFScanlineSize() function. When TIFFScanlineSize encountered an
integer-overflow and returned zero, this value was not checked. A
remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted PPM image format
file, that when processed by ppm2tiff would lead to ppm2tiff executable
crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of
the user running the ppm2tiff binary.
