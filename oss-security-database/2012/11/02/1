I am not sure I am allowed to forward the quoted tdf-security mail
that lists the LibreOffice commits.

But it has in its mailheader:
From:     Caol√°n McNamara <caolanm@...hat.com>
perhaps he can share the details (and I wonder why this caught redhat
by surprise then);

(The whole OpenOffice/LibreOffice security issue handling is not really
good ... long embargoes that get extended wildly even though fixes are in
public GIT already, etc )

Ciao, Marcus
