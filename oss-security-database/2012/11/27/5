Subject: CVE request: libproxy issue

Hi Kurt, Steve, vendors,

there is a format string issue with libproxy:

  https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=791086

Version 0.4.10 isn't affected anymore according to Shawn Chang.

Kurt, could you possibly have a look and assign a CVE, please?

Thanks,
Matthias
