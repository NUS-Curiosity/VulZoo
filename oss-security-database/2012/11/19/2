        0.3.9.1

Hi all,

A security vulnerability has been fixed in WeeChat 0.3.9.2.
This problem affects all versions from 0.3.0 to 0.3.9.1.

Untrusted command for function hook_process could lead to execution of
commands, because of shell expansions.

This problem is only caused by some scripts calling function
hook_process (giving untrusted command), but the problem has been
fixed in WeeChat, for maximum safety: WeeChat will not use the shell
any more to execute command.

If you are not using any script calling function hook_process, you are
not concerned by this problem.

For more info, visit the WeeChat security page:
