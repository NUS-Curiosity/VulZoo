Well, I don't think it should get one. expose_php is no news and so it is
expectable that it will make things like e.g. PHP's version number appear
in the HTTP response. Hiding it is security by obscurity and with the same 
argument you could say that it's a vulnerability that PHP's source code is
open source. IMHO.

PS: If such things happen regardless of expose_php's value it is of course
worth a CVE.
