I have barely seen attackers actually trying to figure out the version
number. 99% are directly trying to exploit known vectors using some
scripts. And to get the version number there's a way simpler way, also
controlled using the same php.ini setting:

    $ echo "HEAD / HTTP/1.0\n" | nc www.php.net 80 | grep PHP
    Server: Apache/1.3.41 (Unix) PHP/5.2.17
    X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.17
