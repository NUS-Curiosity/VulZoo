I wouldn't, and thankfully it does not.  The list you're seeing has nothing to do with what's enabled or disabled on the server.  It's a build-time list of all the modules that were available in the source tree.  It's completely static for a given version of PHP.  As an example, in the abovementioned URL, you see NSAPI, ISAPI and Apache 2.0 mentioned, although this is an Apache 1.3 server.  We also surely don't have COM and .NET installed on that Linux server either.

This is definitely not a security issue of any kind.
