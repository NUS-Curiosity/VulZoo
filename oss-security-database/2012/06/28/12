Just for some history on this somewhat odd feature. It was added in
order to be able to put the PHP logo on the phpinfo() page. We had
originally just used an img link to php.net, but got a lot of
phone-home privacy complaints about that. So we needed a way to
display an image locally and didn't want to have to try to figure out
where to copy that image during installation, plus it would be hard to
manage access to it and the overall idea of copying anything to
someone's docroot just sucks. So, we could either have given up on it,
or, bake it into PHP this way along with an ini switch to disable it.
The motivation wasn't to add an easter egg. The April 1
PHP_EGG_LOGO_GUID came later.
