I wasn't asking for a CVE for this issue (no "CVE Request: in
subject), This is more of a place holder/information (oss-security is
read by a lot of security vendors/etc, and is for more than just CVE
assignments) and to make sure people are aware of the issue, since I
wasn't even aware of it until someone pointed it out to me.

Exposing the fact that I am running PHP is one thing. Exposing exactly
which modules I have loaded is quite another.
