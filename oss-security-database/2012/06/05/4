Subject: CVE request: openldap does not honor TLSCipherSuite configuration
 option

Could a CVE be assigned to this issue?

It was reported that OpenLDAP, when using the Mozilla NSS backend, would
ignore any TLSCipherSuite configuration settings.  When the
TLSCipherSuite setting is configured, OpenLDAP would use the default
cipher suite, ignoring the setting.

While the default cipher suite contains some weak ciphers (e.g.
MD5-based), it is still not easy to break the encryption to obtain
sensitive information.  However, if an administrator wishes to enforce
the use of stronger ciphers by overriding the defaults using
TLSCipherSuite, they should be able to trust that, when the
configuration items is in place, the stronger ciphers are used.  Due to
this flaw, that is not the case.
