Subject: CVE requests (x2) for Mantis Bug Tracker (MantisBT) before 1.2.11

CVE REQUEST #1

Title: Reporters can edit arbitrary bugnotes via SOAP API
Affected: MantisBT 1.2.10 and earlier versions
Not affected: MantisBT 1.2.11

Description:
Roland Becker and Damien Regad (MantisBT developers) found that any user
able to report issues via the SOAP interface could also modify any
bugnotes (comments) created by other users. In a default/typical
MantisBT installation, SOAP API is enabled and any user can sign up to
report new issues. This vulnerability therefore impacts upon many public
facing MantisBT installations.

CVE REQUEST #2

Title: delete_attachments_threshold not checked on attachment deletion
Affected: MantisBT 1.2.10 and earlier versions
Not affected: MantisBT 1.2.11

Description:
Roland Becker (MantisBT developer) found that the
delete_attachments_threshold permission was not being checked when a
user attempted to delete an attachment from an issue. The more generic
update_bug_threshold permission was being checked instead. MantisBT
administrators may have been under the false impression that their
configuration of the delete_attachments_threshold was successfully
preventing unwanted users from deleting attachments.
