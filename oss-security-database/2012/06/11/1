Subject: CVE request -- libguestfs: virt-edit doesn't preserve file
 permissions

Description of the problem:
virt-edit creates a new file when it is used and thus does not
preserve file permissions, file owner and SELinux context on the
files that it was editing.

As a consequence, if certain security-sensitive files in the guest
were edited using virt-edit, they would become world-readable.

Proposed upstream patch:
