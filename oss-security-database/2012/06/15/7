It ensures that the user of the system is aware of the risks.

This position will only occur when the patch to the vulnerability is 
applied (i.e. during an out of service upgrade). The admins of the 
system should always read the release notes to patches and upgrades - 
otherwise they wouldn't know what else might be broken, deprecated.

I think it's the right approach.
