Subject: CVE Request: NetworkManager creates an open network when asked to
 create an adhoc-WPA network

Hi All,

In NetworkManager, when a new wireless network was created with
WPA/WPA2 security, it created an open/insecure network.
>From the commit, it seems the bug exists in the kernel.

Reference:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=782627
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=655972
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/commi/?id=69247a00eacd00617acbf1dfcee8497437b8ad39

The patch disables WPA adhoc networks completely untill a better
solution is found.

Can a CVE id be please assigned to this issue?
