Thanks !

> Also is there a specific source file/etc that contains the fix?

The changelog refers to this change:
https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/commit/115c17c1f9aab4bd431ae44a36741b86be4c5f53

However, this one (safer default values for options like
"secureProcessing" and "expandingEntityRefs") seems much more relevant:
https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/commit/ec692bd3b5e386261413210191b179fec22b6cd2

By the way, credits are wrong (I'm the original reporter) and should be
fixed soon.
