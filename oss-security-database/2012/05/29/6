I suspect that this actually came from here:

http://www.nessus.org/plugins/index.php?view=single&id=11618

It's entirely possible that there's a typo in the web page because it
talks about TCP+FIN but refers to web pages dealing with the much older
TCP+RST.

There is actually a SYN+FIN discard fix in the mainline kernel which
would appear to be a DoS ("Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that SYN+FIN
attacks were bringing his linux machines to their limits.") should we
have a CVE for this issue?  (I'll ask in a separate message if so.)
