This test case suggests to me that you have to specify the list of
encrypted columns explicitly:

<http://elixir.ematia.de/trac/browser/elixir/trunk/tests/test_encryption.py>

Based on this example, it's not clear to me if the current
implementation supports get_by with an encrypted column.  If this is a
feature which needs preserving, there is no apparent way around
convergent encryption.
