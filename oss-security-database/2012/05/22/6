Subject: CVE Request -- mosh (and probably vte too): mosh server DoS (long
 loop) due improper parsing of terminal parameters in terminal dispatcher

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   based on:
   [1] http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=673871
   [2] https://github.com/keithw/mosh/issues/271

A) Mosh issue:
==============
A denial of service flaw was found in the way mosh, a remote terminal application, performed 
processing of parameters that have been passed to the terminal in the terminal dispatcher class 
(previously there was no limit for the count of parameters, which were allowed to be passed to the 
dispatcher). A remote atttacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (mosh server to 
enter long for loop when trying to process the paramaters) via specially-crafted escape sequence string.

Upstream ticket:
[3] https://github.com/keithw/mosh/issues/271

Relevant upstream patch:
[4] https://github.com/keithw/mosh/commit/9791768705528e911bfca6c4d8aa88139035060e

References:

[6] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=823943

Could you allocate a CVE id for this? (issue confirmed by mosh upstream)

B) vte issue:
=============
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=673871#5

there is similar issue in vte too (Gnome bug private for now):
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=676090

Cc-ed Behdad Esfahbod on this post to clarify, what are the upstream plans
regarding this report in vte and if the CVE id has been already assigned for
it.

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
