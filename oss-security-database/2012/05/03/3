Subject: CVE Request: evolution-data-server lacks SSL checking in its libsoup users

Hi,

The libsoup SSL certificate checking problem Ludwig exposed is drawing some
circles.

I started looking at the libsoup users, first one is evolution-data-server,

None of the libsoup users there seem to handle SSL certificate trust correctly (or at all) in my eyes.

In version 2.28 these are.
	Groupwise protocol handling (server/groupwise/e-gw-connection.c)
	Exchange protocol handling (server/exchange/lib/e2k-context.c)
	Google (servers/google/libgdata-google/gdata-google-service.c)
	calendar/backends/http/e-cal-backend-http.c
	calendar/backends/caldav/e-cal-backend-caldav.c

I do not fully understand the correct solution to this yet though, whether we need
to pass in additional flags, or evaluate the "trusted" flag after the connect.

Ciao, Marcus
