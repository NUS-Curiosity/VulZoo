Yes, the existence of supplementary groups is intentional - but that doesn't mean that inheriting supplementary groups is intentional.

>From the administrator's point of view, the privileges are effectively assigned to "the user" as an "atomic" identity - they are configured in /etc/passwd and /etc/group _and associated with an UID_.  In "ordinary" case, programs running with a specific UID are expected to always use the same primary GID, and same primary groups.  Yes, the implementation does not match the administrator's point of view, the UID, GID and supplementary groups are sparete, and , e.g. setuid/setgid may cause a different configuration from the "primary" case, or switching privileges temporarily creates non-ordinary situations.  Still, I think that keeping the administrator's point of view in mind is important.

In the above example, if there really is a "logging" group, and an application is configured to drop privileges and switch to uid $APP_UID, the administrator would expect that whether the app should or should not have the "logging" group membership is configured in /etc/groups for $APP_UID, not for root.  So, I can't see that as an argument for intentionally not dropping supplementary groups.
