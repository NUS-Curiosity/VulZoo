Supplemental groups are just for file access or anything that does a group 
permission check. The only way to determine if this is a security problem is to 
run the find command looking for any file with that group. Maybe something like 
this (assuming root):

find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -gid 0 -perm /00030 -printf "%-55p %g\t%M\n" 

What programs that don't drop privs correctly does is call attention to it as 
something that should be attacked because it can be used as a stepping stone to 
other parts of the system. On the programming side, these should always be fixed 
so that we err on the side of caution. On the CVE issuing side you probably want 
to see what files exist with permissions that could be used to help decide its 
importance.

For example, there are a number of files that are group root writable and even 
more that are group root readable. So, dropping root badly can eventually lead 
to system compromise in a few steps. but when other groups are involved, you 
need to run the find command.

For anyone wanting to go bug hunting, I have a script here:
http://people.redhat.com/sgrubb/security/find-nodrop-groups
that can be used. It finds many, many problems dropping supplemental groups. More 
than I alone want to fix.
