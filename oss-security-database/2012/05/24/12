I have to agree. Changing UID/GID from root to something else is a security 
feature by reducing privileges and write access to system files. Not doing it 
correctly is CWE-271. Looking it up, you can easily find 2 CVE's that are about 
not dropping supplemental groups.

If it were intended that you change uid/gid but retain a supplemental group, 
then you don't understand how /etc/group was supposed to be setup and used. 
Additionally you would have called initgroups() to pickup the new group 
memberships associated with that acct. So, its always wrong to call setgid()||
setuid() without taking care of supplemental groups.

Failing to drop supplemental groups, though, is not a vulnerability. Its an 
exposure to risk because you can bet someone will find another hole and exploit 
it and these extra privs allow them to escalate further.

Here is a real life case:

+ if ( initgroups(pw->pw_name, NULL) != 0 || setgid(pw->pw_gid) != 0 ||
+                                setuid(pw->pw_uid) != 0 ) 

This is not upstream. This is a patch to drop capabilities by changing uid/gid. 
The person writing the patch intended to do the right thing - but failed. See 
the bug? This is in a network facing daemon that parses untrusted network 
packets.
