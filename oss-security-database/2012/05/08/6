Subject: CVE request: XSS and SQL injection in serendipity before 1.7.1

http://blog.s9y.org/archives/240-Serendipity-1.6.1-released.html

"This release mainly addresses two security issues found by Stefan
Schurtz (thanks a lot, again!). One is a XSS issue in the media
database panel, the other an SQL injection in the media database
section. Both issues can only be exploited if you are logged in to your
blog and you click a specially crafted link. The SQL injection cannot
be used to extract sensitive information from the database or delete
data."

The webpage of the vulnerability researcher is
http://www.rul3z.de/

However, there seems to be no information yet about those vulns,
probably they'll appear there soon.
