Subject: connman heads up / CVE requests

Hi,

I reported several issues to the connman developers last week and it
seems they made patches for most of them which were
posted on their mailing list. The one that I am missing is related
to the GKeyFile/VPN settings storage. I did not review the
patches itself, except checking them slightly.
The bug report is here:

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=715172

It was not a full review, so some parts remain unchecked.

Some dists seem to ship it and before it goes the wicd way,
I'd rather ask for CVE's myself.

Sebastian
