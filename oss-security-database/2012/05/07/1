Subject: CVE request: A Pidgin remote crash

Could I request that a CVE be issued for a possible
remotely-triggerable crash in Pidgin?  To my knowledge no CVE exists
for this issue.  The issue is described at
http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=63

The Pidgin project has just released version 2.10.4 which fixes the issue.

Thanks,
Mark
