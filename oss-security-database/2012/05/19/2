Subject: RE: libupnp buffer overflows

You can find the list of source code commits for the 1.6.16 here: http://pupnp.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=pupnp/pupnp;a=log;h=01d7c05fb882bb1904f5022a33eef8a68d8b8bdc.

Moreover, the most important bug fixes have been added in the tracker: http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=841026&group_id=166957&func=browse.

To sum up, most of the issues were about memory leaks (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3497009&group_id=166957&atid=841026), a few of them were about security like an out of bound access (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3496933&group_id=166957&atid=841026, classified as CWE-119 by Coverity). However, most of the other "security" changes have been made to:
	- replace strcpy or sprint by strncpy or snprintf as using sprintf is seen as a defect by coverity (CWE-676)
 	- remove implicit integer conversion between unsigned and signed (seen as CWE-681 by Coverity)

Best Regards,

Fabrice

"""
Those issues were found by Coverity (http://www.coverity.com). Coverity affects CWE identifiers like CWE-170 but I haven't kept the CWE identifiers of all the fixed bugs.

Did you Fabrice verify if these had security impact? I can try to help if needed.
