Comparing the received version of the message with its original source,
it appears that the mailing list software (ezmlm?) mangled Micah's
message by modifying the internal mime parts of the message, despite
them being wrapped inside a multipart/signed block.  This contravenes
the relevant standards [0], which indicate that the data within a
multipart/signed MIME part needs to be treated by any MTA as opaque.

I don't know who updates ezmlm these days, but that probably needs to be
addressed if there's an expectation that people should be able to send
cryptographically-signed messages with non-ASCII text to the list.
