Ok I see this one and several more:

================================

6.1.11		May 11, 2012
Bug fixes:
[7358] wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Fixing a potential security issue
related to archives

================================

6.1.1           October 22, 2010
This version includes a lots news such as DKIM support, autosignoff
footer link included in lists messages, ...
Various vulnerability have been solved in 6.1.1 : cross side scripting,
cross-Site request forgeries, brute force attack, DOS. These
vulnerabilities were identified with the help of P. Gardenat (Rectorat
 de Rennes) during a security audit on Sympa.
- ---------------------
web_tt2/error.tt2, wwsympa/wwsympa.fcgi.in:  Now shared document
can't	be read or edited unless list is open. This is a security fix

================================

6.0		1st October 2009
Security:
- - [reported by T. Retout] SQL injection threat removed by using place
holders instead of direct sprint in a query.
- - [Submitted by N. Bertrand, univ.  Minnesota] Basic logs in debug
don't issue the password  unencrypted in the logs for function
Auth::ldap_authentication. This way, this password won't be sent
unencrypted to a possible syslog server.
- - [#4439] [#4440] [reported by O.Berger] security vulnerability which
use a file in /tmp.
- - [#4430] store temporary files in Sympa's own tmp directory instead
of /tmp to prevent symlink attacks

================================

Can you confirm these and I will assign CVE's for the outstanding issues.
