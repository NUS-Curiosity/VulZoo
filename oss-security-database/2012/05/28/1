Subject: Duplicate CVE identifiers (CVE-2012-2391 and CVE-2012-2942) assigned
 to HAProxy issue

Hello Steve, vendors,

previously the CVE identifier of CVE-2012-2391 has been assigned to the following issue:
[1] http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/23/12
[2] http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/23/15

Today when checking CVE new mail, noticed the CVE-2012-2942 yet:

Buffer overflow in the trash buffer in the header capture
functionality in HAProxy before 1.4.21, when global.tune.bufsize is
set to a value greater than the default and header rewriting is
enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.


Both of these are referring to the same issue.

Steve, CVE-assign could you clarify which CVE id should be kept and
which one should be rejected as duplicate?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
