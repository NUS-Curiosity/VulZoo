Security issue reporters are usually not held responsible for
reporting the issues that they find to every affected distribution
themselves.  That is why common id numbers (CVEs) are important.  They
give us a common reference for every problem.  Then its the job of
those of us representing such distributions to pass the information on
to the appropriate tracking systems within our own focus areas.

Best wishes,
