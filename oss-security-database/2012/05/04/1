Subject: CVE Request: more tight ioctl permissions in dl2k driver

Hi,

Can you please assign a CVE for this issue:

Stephan Mueller reported lack of capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN) checks
in private ioctls in the dl2k network card driver.

The netdev team will probably remove the handling of the SIOCDEVPRIVATE*
calls from this driver though and not use Jeffs patch directly.
