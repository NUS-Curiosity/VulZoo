Subject: CVE Request -- anaconda: Weak permissions by writing password configuration
 file in bootloader configuration module

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

   a security flaw was found in the way bootloader configuration module of
Anaconda, a graphical system installer, stored password hashes when performing
write of password configuration file (0755 permissions were used instead of
0700 ones). A local users could use this flaw to obtain password hashes and
conduct brute force password guessing attacks (possibly leading to password
circumvention, machine reboot or use of custom kernel or initrd command line
parameters).

Upstream patch:
[1] http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=anaconda.git;a=commit;h=03ef13b625cc06873a924e0610340f8489fd92df

Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
