Subject: CVE request: sympa (try again)


Hi,

Please assign a CVE for Sympa, any version prior to 6.1.11. It is
possible to open the archive management ("arc_manage") page for any
list, even those set to only be available to members, giving anyone the
option to download the archive, or delete the archive.

thank you,
micah

ps - for some reason the previous message is formatted strange, so I'm
sending this one without the signature
