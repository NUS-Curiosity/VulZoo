Subject: OpenSSL invalid TLS/DTLS record attack (CVE-2012-2333)

I think these should be in here given the importance of OpenSSL, as well
as to encourage relevant follow-ups.

OpenSSL Security Advisory [10 May 2012]
=======================================

Invalid TLS/DTLS record attack (CVE-2012-2333)
===============================================

A flaw in the OpenSSL handling of CBC mode ciphersuites in TLS 1.1, 1.2 and
DTLS can be exploited in a denial of service attack on both clients and
servers.

DTLS applications are affected in all versions of OpenSSL. TLS is only
affected in OpenSSL 1.0.1 and later.

Thanks to Codenomicon for discovering this issue using Fuzz-o-Matic fuzzing
as a service testing platform.

The fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL core team.

Affected users should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1c, 1.0.0j or 0.9.8x
