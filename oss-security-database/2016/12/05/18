Subject: CVE request Qemu: display: virtio-gpu: memory leakage while updating
 cursor

   Hello,

Quick Emulator built with the Virtio GPU Device emulator support is vulnerable 
to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while updating the cursor data in 
update_cursor_data_virgl.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory bytes, resulting 
in DoS for a host.
