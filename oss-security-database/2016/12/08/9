Subject: CVE request Qemu: display: cirrus_vga: a divide by zero in

   Hello,

Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the Cirrus CLGD 54xx VGA Emulator support is

when cirrus graphics mode was set to be VGA.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
instance on the host, resulting in DoS.
