Subject: CVE Request: Linux: net: out-of-bounds due do a signedness issue when
 defragging ipv6

Hi,

There is a bug in the Linux kernel ipv6 implementation, which leads to
an out-of-bounds write on ipv6 packet defragmentation.

A fix was sent upstream:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg407525.html

More details here:

Could you assign a CVE for this?

Thanks!
