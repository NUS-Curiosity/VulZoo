Subject: CVE request: Kernel: kvm: stack memory information leakage

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine(CONFIG_KVM) support 
is vulnerable to an information leakage issue. It could occur on x86 platform, 
in 32bit mode, while emulating instructions.

A user/process could use this flaw to leak host kernel memory bytes.
