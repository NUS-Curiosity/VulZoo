4.8.12 doesn't have the fix included, despite being released on the same
day the commit was merged into net/ and despite the advance notice in
private via security@...nel.org.  It's currently in the net/ "stable" queue
which operates seperately from the rest of the kernel.  It'll be merged
whenever that process plays itself out.
