Subject: CVE request: Kernel: kvm: out of bounds memory access via vcpu_id

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine(CONFIG_KVM) support 
is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds memory access issue. It could occur on x86 
platform, while servicing I/O APIC requests with larger vcpu_id.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in 
DoS or it could potentially be used to escalate privileges on a host.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/81cdb259fb6d8c1c4ecfeea389ff5a73c07f5755

Thank you.
