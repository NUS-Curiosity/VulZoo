Use CVE-2016-9928.

At present, we do not understand whether the behavior of other
mentioned products, such as slixmpp and SleekXMPP, should be
considered a vulnerability. If the situation is essentially "the
product could be improved to make it less likely for third-party code
authors to accidentally create an unsafe interaction," then typically
a CVE ID is not required.

However, if (for example) there is going to be a DSA for the
python-sleekxmpp and python3-sleekxmpp packages, then we can assign an
ID. As far as we can tell, the python3-slixmpp* packages are not
available in jessie, and poezio is packaged for Fedora but not for any
Debian distribution.
