Subject: CVE request Qemu: usb: redirector: memory leakage when destroying

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the USB redirector usb-guest support is 
vulnerable to a memory leakage flaw. It could occur while destroying the USB 
redirector in 'usbredir_handle_destroy'.

A guest user/process could use this issue to leak host memory, resulting in 
DoS for a host.
