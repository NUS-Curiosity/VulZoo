Basically is what Seth said, but apart ffmpeg some more important packages are 
not up to date, for example:

root@...goyle:~# openvpn --version 
OpenVPN 2.3.6 mips-openwrt-linux-gnu [SSL (OpenSSL)] [LZO] [EPOLL] [MH] [IPv6] 
built on Nov  7 2015 
library versions: OpenSSL 1.0.2d 9 Jul 2015, LZO 2.08
