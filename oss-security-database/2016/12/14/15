Thanks for being so helpful.

I was just trying to see of there are other people out there who also
think this is a problem. This list seemed like a place where I could
find such people.
Perhaps someone knows a work around, perhaps some post-processing tool.
If none exists, I guess we have to try to fix the problem at the source
or use another CVE databse.
