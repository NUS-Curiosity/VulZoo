Subject: CVE Request: FlightGear: Allows the route manager to overwrite
 arbitrary files

Hi

The FlightGear project fixed a security issue, allowing arbitrary file
overwrites for files the user running FlightGear has write access to
and could be taken advantage to for other impact as arbitrary code
execution.

Can you please assign a CVE for this FlightGear issue.

Regards,
Salvatore
