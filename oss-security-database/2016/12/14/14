Subject: Re: Re: CVE request: w3m - multiple vulnerabilities

FYI, my previous report was for debian's w3m fork. Now I also tested
original w3m 0.5.3.
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/w3m/files/w3m/w3m-0.5.3/)

The original w3m 0.5.3 is also affected by at least following CVEs
CVE-2016-9422
CVE-2016-9424
CVE-2016-9425
CVE-2016-9426
CVE-2016-9432
CVE-2016-9439
CVE-2016-9440
CVE-2016-9441
CVE-2016-9622
CVE-2016-9623
CVE-2016-9624
CVE-2016-9625
CVE-2016-9626
CVE-2016-9627

But the case of CVE-2016-9422, which made debian's w3m stack smashing,
can only make original w3m 0.5.3 heap-buffer-overflow write. I haven't
found cases to smash stack yet.

For other CVEs, I don't know. Maybe original w3m is not affected. Maybe
those issues are covered by above issues.
