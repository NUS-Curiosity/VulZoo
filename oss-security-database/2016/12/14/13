What would help is getting involved in CVE, something I'm working on, keep
an eye on #cvementor and https://cvementor.org (just a collection form
currently). Also if you want to create CVEs you need to request them
through a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), for Open Source you can ask here,
or via https://iwantacve.org/
