It looks like the vulnerability is due to a missing escaping of shell
arguments in the sender's e-mail address.  This commit seems to be
the one that fixes the bug:
https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/commit/4835657cd639fbd09afd33307cef164edf807cdc#diff-ace81e501931d8763b49f2410cf3094dR1449

So it depends on whether a web form allows one to control the "from"
mail address or not.

I noticed this Drupal module: https://www.drupal.org/project/phpmailer
which has some sort of integration with the widely used mimemail module.
The linked module http://drupal.org/project/smtp also uses PHPMailer.
There are undoubtedly more modules that do.

The LCMS system Chamilo also uses PHPMailer for sending mails internally.
