Subject: CVE Request Openstack-infra puppet-gerrit module xss vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hello Everyone,

A vulnerability was discovered in the OpenStack-Infra Puppet module
for Gerrit (see below). In order to ensure full traceability, we need
a CVE number assigned. This issue is already public.

It was recently discovered that our puppet-gerrit module configures
Gerrit in a way which makes it vulnerable to a XSS attack. This stems
from our configuration marking text/html as a 'safe' mimetype[1].
This configuration change was first made in May 2014[2] but we believe
it did not begin working until Feb 2015[3]. Using this, a user could
potentially craft a review which when visited at the proper url would
have access to the account information of any user visiting that url.

It is highly recommended that all downstream users of this module
apply this commit[4] to protect themselves against this attack.

Thanks,
Greg
