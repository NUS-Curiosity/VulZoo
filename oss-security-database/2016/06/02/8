 domain input in libxl device handling

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2016-4963 / XSA-178
                              version 3

       Unsanitised driver domain input in libxl device handling

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

libxl's device-handling code freely uses and trusts information from
the backend directories in xenstore.

The backend domain (driver domain) can store bogus data in the
backend, causing libxl's enquiry functions to fail, confusing
management tools.

A driver domain can also remove its backend directory from xenstore
entirely, preventing the device from showing up in device listings and
preventing it from being removed and replaced.

A driver domain can cause libxl to generate disk eject events for
disks for which the driver domain is not responsible.

IMPACT
======

A malicious driver domain can deny service to management tools.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

This vulnerability is only applicable to systems which are using
driver domains, and then only where the driver domain is not intended
to be fully trusted with respect to the host.

Such Xen systems using libxl based toolstacks (for example xl or
libvirt with the libxl driver) are vulnerable.

Note that even with this vulnerability a driver domain based system is
better from a security point of view, than a system where devices are
provided directly by dom0.  Users and vendors of systems using driver
domains should not change their configuration.

MITIGATION
==========

No mitigation is available.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Wei Liu from Citrix.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch set from XSA-175, plus the
appropriate attached patch set below, resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

HOWEVER note that deployment of the patches for XSA-175 (which are a
prerequisite for the patches for XSA-178) is restricted.  See
XSA-175's `Deployment During Embargo' section for details.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
