Subject: CVE Request Qemu: scsi: esp: OOB write when using non-DMA mode in
 get_cmd

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the ESP/NCR53C9x controller emulation support 
is vulnerable to an OOB write access issue. The controller uses 16-byte FIFO 
buffer for command and information transfer. The OOB write occurs while 
reading from information transfer buffer via non-DMA mode in routine 
get_cmd().

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:

   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-06/msg00150.html

Reference:

This issue was discovered by Li Qiang of 360.cn Inc.

Thank you.
