Subject: Please reject duplicate CVE for libxml2

Hi, it seems two CVEs were assigned for the same issue in libxml2:

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q1/683
http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/214

Daniel Veillard reported to us that these issues are the same and fixed
by:

https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=bdd66182ef53fe1f7209ab6535fda56366bd7ac9

The upstream bug is:

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=762100

Can CVE-2016-4483 please be rejected as a duplicate of CVE-2016-3627?

Thank you!
