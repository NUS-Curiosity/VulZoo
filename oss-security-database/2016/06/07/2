Hi

http://gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2016-1 :

> Setuid programs using GnuTLS 3.4.12 could potentially allow an
> attacker to overwrite and corrupt arbitrary files in the filesystem.
> This issue was introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.12 and fixed in GnuTLS 3.4.13.
> Recommendation: Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.4.13, or later versions.
