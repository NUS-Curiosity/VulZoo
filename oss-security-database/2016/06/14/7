Subject: CVE request: Python HTTP header injection in urrlib2/urllib/httplib/http.client

Hi,

I would like to request a CVE for a Python header injection flaw in
urrlib2/urllib/httplib/http.client.

HTTPConnection.putheader() allows unsafe characters, which can be used to
inject additional headers.

Upstream bug with reproducer :
https://bugs.python.org/issue22928


Kind regards,
