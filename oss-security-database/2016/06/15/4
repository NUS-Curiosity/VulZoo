Subject: Re: CVE request: several SOGo issues (DOS, XSS, information leakage)

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

We have a few questions about this. First, several of the
https://sogo.nu/bugs URLs provide an "Access Denied" response and we
were wondering whether that was intentional. MITRE has no role in
determining the list charter, but
http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security says
"List Content Guidelines ... Any security issues that you post to
oss-security should be either already public or to be made public by
your posting."

When required, CVE IDs can be assigned based on commits in conjunction
with non-public bug reports; this potentially addresses all of the
cases except for SOGo #3670, which is apparently not yet public at
all.

Also, your message didn't mention whether you are making the CVE
request on behalf of the Inverse team, or whether you are noting
issues that are security-related from your own perspective.

Going through the list of public issues:

SOGo #3510 - is the ultimate case of the entire issue summarized by
"copies the attachment (into memcached?) and then eliminates the copy
in the sogod. The memcached copy stays forever/until the SOGo service
is restarted"? Or is there a second implementation error? It seems
that part of the issue, but not all of it, is a feature request (SOGo
#3135) suggesting that SOGo should have size limits because
configuring limits at the level of the web server and SMTP server
disrupts the user experience.

SOGo #3695 is listed twice but the second one has 3696 in the URL. We
are guessing that the second "SOGo #3695" is just a "SOGo #3696" typo.
More importantly, are there two distinct code problems? Or is it a
single code problem that is reachable with different attack vectors?

SOGo #3718 has two identical
"Issue: https://sogo.nu/bugs/view.php?id=3718" lines. Was one of them
supposed to be a different URL?

SOGo #2598 - we are able to assign CVE-2014 IDs. Does "SOGo #2598:
Script injection in calendar title ... Reporter: Jens Erat" mean that
your own discovery was only about the calendar title, and that
additional attack vectors ("contacts module" and "CSS dialogs") were
follow-on discoveries by the Inverse team?
