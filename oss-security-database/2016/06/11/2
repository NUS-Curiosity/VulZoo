Subject: CVE-Request: heap overflow in Python

Hello.
In zipimport module,
if compress != 0, then bytes_size = data_size + 1
data_size is not sanitized, so if data_size = -1,
then it overflows and becomes 0.
In that case bytes_size becomes 1 and python allocates small heap,
but after that in fread, it overflows heap.

Fix info
https://bugs.python.org/issue26171

Please help assign a CVE to this vulnerability.

Thank you.
