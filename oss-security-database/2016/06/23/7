Subject: CVE Requests: WordPress: 4.5.3 maintenance and security release:
 several issues

Hi

WordPress issued version 4.5.3 a maintenace and security release. The
advisory mentions several issues fixed:

https://wordpress.org/news/2016/06/wordpress-4-5-3/

WordPress versions 4.5.2 and earlier are affected by several security
issues:

 - redirect bypass in the customizer, reported by Yassine Aboukir;

 - two different XSS problems via attachment names, reported by Jouko
   Pynn√∂nen and Divyesh Prajapati;

 - revision history information disclosure, reported independently by
   John Blackbourn from the WordPress security team and by Dan Moen from
   the Wordfence Research Team;

 - oEmbed denial of service reported by Jennifer Dodd from Automattic;

 - unauthorized category removal from a post, reported by David Herrera
   from Alley Interactive;

 - password change via stolen cookie, reported by Michael Adams from the
   WordPress security team;

 - and some less secure sanitize_file_name edge cases reported by Peter
   Westwood of the WordPress security team.

(I wrapped the advisory text in the various separate items).

Could you assign CVE identifier as needed for the above issues fixed
with the Wordpress 4.5.3 release?

Regards,
Salvatore
