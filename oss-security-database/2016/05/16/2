Subject: CVE-2016-3713 Linux kernel: kvm: OOB r/w access issue with MSR
 0x2F8

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine(CONFIG_KVM) with 
variable Memory Type Range Registers(MTRR) support is vulnerable to an 
out-of-bounds r/w access issue. It could occur while accessing processor's 
MTRRs via ioctl(2) calls.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to manipulate host kernel's 
memory bytes leading to information disclosure OR potentially crashing the 
kernel resulting in DoS.

'CVE-2016-3713' has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc. A proposed 
patch is attached herein to fix this issue.

This issue was reported by Mr David Matlack of Google Inc.


Thank you.
