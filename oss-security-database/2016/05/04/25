Quoted relationship between limbs holds only mod 2**32 and written 
without wrapping looks like this:

limb[1] = limb[0] + limb[2] - 2 - 2**32

It also means that the original number is a multiple of 2**32 + 1. More 
precisely, it's a product of 2**32 + 1 and a number with limbs (1, 
limb[2] - 2, limb[0]).
