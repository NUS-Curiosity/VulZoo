I haven't investigated deeply but it seems very plausible to me:
Here's the delegates.xml work-alike:
https://sourceforge.net/p/graphicsmagick/code/ci/default/tree/config/delegates.mgk.in

This appears to be executed via:
https://sourceforge.net/p/graphicsmagick/code/ci/default/tree/magick/delegate.c
which tries to escape arguments using UnixShellTextEscape(). This function
appears to replace \`"$ chars with backslash-escaped versions. I'm not
sure this is a safe mechanism either.

Thanks
