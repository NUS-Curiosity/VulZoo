Subject: CVE Request: information leak in wilc1000 module of Linux kernel

Hello,

In the milc1000 module (drivers/staging/wilc1000/wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.c),
The 6-bytes stack object “mac” is not initialized but leaked via “nla_put”.
This bug may result in leaks of sensitive kernel stack data.

The patch of this bug has been accepted by Linux kernel maintainer and will
be
merged in the next kernel release (see the message bellow).

Fix info:
*http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-wireless/msg150352.html
<http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-wireless/msg150352.html>*
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging.git

Could you please assign a CVE to it?

Thanks,
Kangjie Lu

"mac" is an array allocated in stack without being initialized,
and will be sent out via "nla_put". The dump_station() is supposed
to initialize the mac address; otherwise, sensitive data in kernel
stack will be leaked. To fix this, copy the mac address to it.
