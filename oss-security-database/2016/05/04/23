Actually, it's "- 2", not "+ 2".  Sorry.  Not that it matters, but I was
uncomfortable leaving the error uncorrected in case someone wants to try
and figure out why exactly this artifact manifests itself like it does.

There's probably an explanation of why the algorithm is likely to hit
numbers of this form, but this is beside the point for software bugs,
which is what I want us to discuss further in this thread.
