Subject: [oCERT 2016-001] Jetty path sanitization issues


Description:

Jetty is a Java HTTP (Web) server and Servlet container.

The Jetty path normalization mechanism suffers of an implementation issue
when parsing the request URLs. 

The path normalization logic implemented in the PathResource class and
introduced in Jetty versions 9.3.x can be defeated by requesting malicious
URLs containing specific escaped characters.

Leveraging on this weakness, a malicious user can gain access to protected
resources (e.g. WEB-INF and META-INF folders and their contents) and defeat
application filters or other security constraints implemented in the
servlet configuration.

A workaround to mitigate the issue, using the 'rewrite' module, can
alternatively be implemented as follows:

  $ java -jar ../start.jar --module=rewrite etc/backslashalias.xml

or 

  $ java -jar ../start.jar --add-to-startd=rewrite
  $ java -jar ../start.jar  etc/backslashalias.xml 

Workaround file backslashalias.xml contents:

  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <!DOCTYPE Configure PUBLIC "-//Jetty//Configure//EN" "http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/configure_9_3.dtd">
  <Configure id="Rewrite" class="org.eclipse.jetty.rewrite.handler.RuleContainer">
    <Call name="addRule">
      <Arg>
        <New class="org.eclipse.jetty.rewrite.handler.RedirectRegexRule">
          <Arg>.*\\.*</Arg>
          <Arg>/</Arg>
          <Set name="statusCode">404</Set>
        </New>
      </Arg>
    </Call>
  </Configure>
