Subject: CVE Request Qemu: block: iscsi: buffer overflow in iscsi_aio_ioctl

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the Block driver for iSCSI images(virtio-blk) 
support is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow flaw. It could occur while 
processing iSCSI asynchronous I/O ioctl(2) calls.

A user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in 
DoS OR potentially leverage it to execute arbitrary code with privileges of 
the Qemu process on the host.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-block/2016-05/msg00779.html

Reference:
----------
   -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1340924

Thank you.
