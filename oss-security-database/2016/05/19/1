I fixed the description in the bug. The problem basically is unchecked
return value from malloc inside the realloc function. So when "crafted"
packets are sent to the server, realloc is triggered to extend the size
of the data structure which holds the network data. Under memory
pressure malloc could fail, which will trigger a null pointer deref.

Yes, we will inform upstream
