Subject: CVE Request: null pointer deref in openslp, can be triggered remotely

Hi All,

The following flaw was reported to us by Yuguang Cai. Basically return
value from malloc isnt checked, in _xrealloc function. This can be
triggered remotely by sending a large number of request, which could
possibly lead malloc to fail at one point, causing crash via null
pointer deref.

Because of the way memory works on modern linux systems, this one seems
to be difficult to exploit, so i am wondering if a CVE id should really
be assigned to this issue.
