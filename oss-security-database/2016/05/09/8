I'm the original reporter of that bug. As far as I can tell, its
impact is low - you could use it to:

 - obtain the ability to execute BPF programs that are owned by other processes
 - perhaps cause a NULL dereference in an exiting task if the BPF
program is executed in
   softirq context after exit_files() has nulled tsk->files
