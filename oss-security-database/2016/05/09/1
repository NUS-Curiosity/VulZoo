Subject: GraphicsMagick Response To "ImageTragick"

The GraphicsMagick project response to the recent "ImageTragick" 
(https://imagetragick.com/) exploits may be found in an email posted 
to the GraphicsMagick announcements mail list and which may be found 
archived here: 
"https://sourceforge.net/p/graphicsmagick/mailman/message/35072963/".

The most important concern noted is that a shell exploit is possible 
via the "gplt" entry in the delegates.mgk file.  While GraphicsMagick 
does escape individual Unix shell arguments appropriately, the gnuplot 
load request can be used to invoke gnuplot's system() command.  The 
mere existence of a system() command makes gnuplot files entirely 
unsecure and it is a very dangerous format.

Unfortunately, I see that SourceForge converted the several patches 
into MS-DOS format.
