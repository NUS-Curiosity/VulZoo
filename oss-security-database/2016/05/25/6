Subject: CVE Request Qemu: scsi: megasas: out-of-bounds write while setting
 controller properties

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter 
emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write access issue. It

controller properties in 'megasas_dcmd_set_properties'.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
on the host resulting in DoS.
