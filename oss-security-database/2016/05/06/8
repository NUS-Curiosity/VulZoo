Subject: CVE Request: ikiwiki: HTML-escape error messages to prevent
 cross-site scripting attack

Hi

Release 3.20160506 of ikiwiki, a wiki compiler, fixed a cross-site
scripting vulnerability. It has been fixed with the following commit:

http://source.ikiwiki.branchable.com/?p=source.git;a=commitdiff;h=32ef584dc5abb6ddb9f794f94ea0b2934967bba7

Could you please assign a CVE identifier for this issue.
