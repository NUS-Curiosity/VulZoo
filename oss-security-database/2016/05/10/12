Subject: CVE Request: x25: a kernel infoleak in x25_negotiate_facilities()

Hello,


In function  x25_negotiate_facilities()  of file net/x25/x25_facilities.c,
the stack object "dte_facilities" is allocated in x25_rx_call_request(),
which is supposed to be initialized in x25_negotiate_facilities. However,
5 fields (8 bytes in total) are not initialized. This object is then copied
to
userland via copy_to_user, thus an infoleak occurs.

Fix info: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/8/59
Patch applied: https://lkml.org/lkml/2016/5/9/1100


Please help assign a CVE to it.


Thanks,
Kangjie Lu
