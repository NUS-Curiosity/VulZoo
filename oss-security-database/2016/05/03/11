You're assuming that all versions with the fix for CVE-2013-0169 are
affected, but the description also says that the new bug is in AES-NI
specific code.  AES-NI support appears to be missing in 1.0.0 and older.
I've just tried grepping 1.0.0t for aesenc (one of the AES-NI mnemonics,
present in the 1.0.1 tree) - it isn't in there.
