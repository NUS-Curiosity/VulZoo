Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Keystone

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an
advisory was not sent yet.


Title: Incorrect Audit IDs in Keystone Fernet Tokens can result in
revocation bypass
Reporter: Lance Bragstad (Rackspace)
Products: OpenStack Kesytone
Affects: ==9.0.0

Description:
Lance Bragstad (Rackspace) reported a vulnerability in the Keystone
Fernet Token Provider. By rescoping a token a user will receive a new
token without correct audit_ids, these incorrect audit_ids will prevent
the entire chain of tokens from being revoked properly. This
vulnerability does not impact revoking a token by it's individual
audit_id. Only deployments with Keystone configured to use Fernet tokens
are impacted.
