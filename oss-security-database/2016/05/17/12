CVE-2016-0718: Expat XML Parser Crashes on Malformed Input

Severity: Critical

Versions Affected: All Expat XML Parser library versions

Description: The Expat XML parser mishandles certain kinds of malformed
input documents, resulting in buffer overflows during processing and error
reporting. The overflows can manifest as a segmentation fault or as memory
corruption during a parse operation. The bugs allow for a denial of service
attack in many applications by an unauthenticated attacker, and could
conceivably result in remote code execution.

Mitigation: Applications that are using Expat should apply the
attached patch as soon as possible.
