I highly doubt that the keyserver dumps are different (except a few
days +-). I got mine from this URL:
http://stueve.us/keydump/

Wild speculation: There are several ways in which keys can be
different. There are v2, v3 and v4 keys (see rfc 4880) and there are
master keys and subkeys. My parser code should handle all of them.
Maybe whatever you do doesn't support all key variants?
