Exploit Author: Paolo Stagno - voidsec@...dsec.com
Vendor Homepage: http://www.tgsoft.it
Version: VirIT Explorer Lite & Pro v.8.1.68
CVSS v2: 6.8 (AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:U/RC:C)

Overview
---- 
Vir.IT eXplorer [1] is an AntiVirus, AntiSpyware and AntiMalware software made in Italy and developed by TG Soft S.a.s.

A major flaws exists in the last version of Vir.IT eXplorer, this vulnerability allow a local attacker,
to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application with SYSTEM privilege.

Details
---- 
The flaw resides in the viritsvclite Service due to bad privileges for the main Vir.IT folder, by default, any user (even guest) will be able to 
replace, modify or alter the file. This would allow an attacker to inject code or replace the executable and have it run in the context of the system.

This would allow a complete compromise of the system on which the antivirus was installed; an attacker can replace the executable, 
reboot the system and it would then compromise the machine. As NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM is the highest privilege level on a Windows machine, 
this allows a total control and access to the system.
