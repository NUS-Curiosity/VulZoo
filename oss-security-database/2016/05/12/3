Subject: Possible CVE request: gdk-pixbuf: Additional fixes to protect
 against overlows in pixops_* functions (similar to CVE-2015-7674)

Hi

CVE-2015-7674, an interger overflow flaw in the pixops_scale_nearest
function, was fixed by

https://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk-pixbuf/commit/?id=e9a5704edaa9aee9498f1fbf6e1b70fcce2e55aa

There is another commit in the gdk-pixbuf repository to fix overflows
in the pixops_composite_nearest, pixops_composite_color_nearest and
pixops_process functions:

https://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk-pixbuf/commit/?id=dbfe8f70471864818bf458a39c8a99640895bd22

Can you aassing an additional CVE for this since the scope for
CVE-2015-7674 was for the pixops_scale_nearest function?

Regards,
Salvatore
