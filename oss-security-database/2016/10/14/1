Subject: docker2aci: infinite loop in deps walking(CVE-2016-8579)

Hello,

It was found that docker2aci fall into an infinite loop while traversing the dependency ancestry of a malformed image file.
,this flaw may cause excessive CPU cycles & resources consume on the host. The happens because no essential check for duplicated
image ID found in  getAncestry() in docker2aci,


CVE-2016-8579 was assigned to this flaw by cve-assign@...re.org<mailto:cve-assign@...re.org>. Here the reply from CVE Assignment Team:

docker2aci is apparently a library [...] and we almost always recognize

the potential for an unattended use case for any library.

[...]

Someone can call the ConvertSavedFile function from an arbitrary

application. [...] It might be automated with cron or a similar unattended

tool that runs in an unrestricted (non-container) environment. Thus,

there is an availability impact because no human is around to notice

the CPU usage.



Use CVE-2016-8579.
