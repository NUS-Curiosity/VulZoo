So some additional comments/criteria:

1) can this actually be exploited in practice in a reasonable manner (e.g.
a 1:1000 amplification I think we'd all agree is a realistic problem)
2) is this being actively used in the wild to exploit systems or cause DoS
situations? In the case of this IKEv1 issue it sounds like yes

and my favorite "should this get a CVE test" question:

3) can it be fixed in a way that still lets the service/clients work?

If it can be fixed in a way that leaves the service/clients working ok then
chances are the old behavior is not something we want to live with anymore
and we need to get rid of it.
