Subject: Re: CVE request: GNU Guile <= 2.0.12: REPL server vulnerable to HTTP inter-protocol attacks

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> GNU Guile, an implementation of the Scheme language, provides a "REPL
> server" which is a command prompt that developers can connect to for
> live coding and debugging purposes. The REPL server is started by the
> '--listen' command-line option or equivalent API.
> 
> Christopher Allan Webber reported that the REPL server is vulnerable to
> the HTTP inter-protocol attack as described at
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-protocol_exploitation>, notably the
> HTML form protocol attack described at
> <https://www.jochentopf.com/hfpa/hfpa.pdf>.
> 
> This constitutes a remote code execution vulnerability for developers
> running a REPL server that listens on a loopback device or private
> network. Applications that do not run a REPL server, as is usually the
> case, are unaffected.
> 
> Developers can work around this vulnerability by binding the REPL server
> to a Unix-domain socket, for instance by running:
> 
>   guile --listen=/some/file
> 
> A modification to the REPL server that detects attempts to exploit this
> vulnerability is available upstream and will be part of Guile 2.0.13, to
> be released shortly.
> 
> Patch: http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile.git/commit/?h=stable-2.0&id=08c021916dbd3a235a9f9cc33df4c418c0724e03

>> +;;; Here we add a procedure to 'before-read-hook' that looks for a possible
>> +;;; HTTP request-line in the first line of input from the client socket. If
>> +;;; present, the socket is drained and closed
