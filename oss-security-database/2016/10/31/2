Sorry to bikeshed, but I think this isn't a kernel-hardening topic at
all, so the thread should continue on oss-security only, please.

Florian, if there's a reason why you think it's kernel-hardening
related, please let me know.  To me, it looks like userspace hardening
that is not even kernel-assisted (at least not directly in this place,
even though the kernel may have helped provide the random numbers).

If your cross-posting was to reach more of the right people, then you
have already done so, and they can join oss-security now. ;-)
