Subject: veracrypt security fixes in 1.19

Hello,
I don't think this was topic in this mailinglist before.
Veracrypt has fixed several security issues [1].
Are there any CVEs available for this issues?

In case of no, will be any CVEs assigned for the issues in
veracrypt <= 1.18?

Best regards,

Christian Rebischke
