Subject: CVE request Qemu: memory leakage in v9fs_link

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 
File System(9pfs) support, is vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could 
occur when calling v9fs_link call.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to leak the host memory 
bytes resulting in DoS for other services.
