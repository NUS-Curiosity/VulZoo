Subject: fd.o #98157: dbus format string vulnerability fixed in 1.10.12

Bug tracked as: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98157
Versions affected: dbus >= 1.4.0
Mitigated in: dbus >= 1.9.10, 1.8.x >= 1.8.16, 1.6.x >= 1.6.30
Fixed in: dbus >= 1.11.6, 1.10.x >= 1.10.12, 1.8.x >= 1.8.22
Exploitable by: local users
Impact: unknown, possibly arbitrary code execution
Reporter: Simon McVittie, Collabora Ltd.

D-Bus <http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/> is an
asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used
for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other
operating systems.

A format string vulnerability in the reference bus implementation,
dbus-daemon, could potentially allow local users to cause arbitrary
code execution or denial of service.

In versions of dbus-daemon that are also vulnerable to CVE-2015-0245,
this format string vulnerability is available to all local users.
These versions should be patched or updated immediately.

In versions of dbus-daemon where CVE-2015-0245 was already fixed, this
is not believed to be exploitable in practice, because the relevant
message is ignored unless it comes from the owner of the bus name
org.freedesktop.systemd1. On the system bus, this bus name is only
allowed to be owned by uid 0; it is intended to be owned by systemd,
and no mechanism is currently known by which an attacker who does not
already have root privileges could induce systemd to send messages
that would trigger the format string vulnerability.

Patching or updating dbus-daemon is strongly recommended. A minimal
patch is attached to this advisory.

Please reference fd.o #98157 or
<https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98157> in any notices
that refer to this vulnerability.
