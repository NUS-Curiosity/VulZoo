Subject: CVE-2016-7039 Kernel: net: unbounded recursion in the vlan GRO
 processing

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with the 802.1Q/802.1ad VLAN(CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q) OR Virtual 
eXtensible Local Area Network(CONFIG_VXLAN) with Transparent Ethernet 
Bridging(TEB) GRO support, is vulnerable to a stack overflow issue. It could 
occur while receiving large packets via GRO path; As an unlimited recursion 
could unfold in both VLAN and TEB modules, leading to a stack corruption in 
the kernel.

A remote user could use this flaw to cause kernel panic by sending malicious 
packets to a server that has GRO enabled.

Please see a proposed patch to fix this issue attached herein.

'CVE-2016-7039' has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.
