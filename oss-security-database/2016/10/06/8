OSSA-2016-012: Malicious qemu-img input may exhaust resources in
Cinder, Glance, Nova
================================================================

:Date: October 06, 2016
:CVE: CVE-2015-5162


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Cinder: <=7.0.2, >=8.0.0 <=8.1.1
- Glance: <=11.0.1, ==12.0.0
- Nova: <=12.0.4, ==13.0.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Richard W.M. Jones of Red Hat reported a vulnerability that affects
OpenStack Cinder, Glance and Nova. By providing a maliciously
crafted disk image an attacker can consume considerable amounts of
RAM and CPU time resulting in a denial of service via resource
exhaustion. Any project which makes calls to qemu-img without
appropriate ulimit restrictions in place is affected by this flaw.
