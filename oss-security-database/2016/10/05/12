There is only one open-sourced Postscript interpreter (Ghostscript) 
that I am aware of.

There are perhaps two open-sourced PDF interpreters available 
(Ghostscript and derivatives of 'xpdf' like 'poppler').

ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick are depending on Ghostscript.

Since Postscript is a format commonly sent to printers, many programs 
produce it, and thus it is used as an intermediate format.  The 
typical use case is for ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick to automatically 
run an external utility which converts from the format being read into 
Postscript, then Ghostscript is used to convert it to a raster format 
(e.g. PNM), and then the raster format is read by 
ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick before being output to the final format.

Disabling Ghostscript or requiring user input to proceed will cause a 
lot of breakage.
