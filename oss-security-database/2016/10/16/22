I tested the code again with afl (after the fixes for the stuff
Agostino reported) and it immediately found multiple issues:

https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/issues/28
Heap overflow in jpc_dec_cp_setfromcox()

https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/issues/29
Heap overflow in jpc_getuint16()

https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/issues/30
segfault / null pointer access in jpc_pi_destroy

https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/issues/31
double free on jpeg parsing

https://github.com/mdadams/jasper/issues/32
assert in jpc_dec_tiledecode()


This will need some work till it's fuzzing resistant.
