Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2016-0762 Apache Tomcat Realm Timing Attack

CVE-2016-0762 Apache Tomcat Realm Timing Attack

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M9
Apache Tomcat 8.5.0 to 8.5.4
Apache Tomcat 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.36
Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.70
Apache Tomcat 6.0.0 to 6.0.45
Earlier, unsupported versions may also be affected.

Description
The Realm implementations did not process the supplied password if the
supplied user name did not exist. This made a timing attack possible to
determine valid user names. Note that the default configuration includes
the LockOutRealm which makes exploitation of this vulnerability harder.

Mitigation
Users of affected versions should apply one of the following mitigations
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M10 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.5 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.0.37 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 7.0.72 or later
  (Apache Tomcat 7.0.71 has the fix but was not released)
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 6.0.47 or later
  (Apache Tomcat 6.0.46 has the fix but was not released)
