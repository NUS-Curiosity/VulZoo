Subject: CVE request Qemu: net: eepro100 memory leakage at device unplug

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the i8255x (PRO100) NIC emulation support is 
vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while unplugging the 
device, and doing so repeatedly would result in leaking host memory affecting, 
other services on the host.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to cause a DoS on the host 
and/or potentially crash the Qemu process on the host.

Upstream patch:

   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-10/msg03024.html

Reference:
----------
   -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1389538

This issue was reported by Li Qiang of 360.cn Inc.

Thank you.
