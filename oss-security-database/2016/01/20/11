sure, though i hope we're not in a "few keys" scenario, that would
definitely be bad :)

right, i'm not suggesting that proof generation be done at runtime, just
that it is an example of a stronger guarantee than we have for runtime
checks, and that it *only* applies to the "generating a small set of
highly-trusted primes" case.

I agree with this analysis, but the chart in the middle of your paper
makes it looks like the diversity is "best", while the "small set of
heavily-evaluated primes" (i'm assuming that's what's meant with the
"few keys" side of the X axis) is merely "good".
