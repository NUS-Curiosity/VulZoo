In glibc's case, it's more about changes which may deserve backports to
distribution releases.

My understanding is shaped in part by your previous assignments.
CVE-2015-1473 is a good example, where the stack usage accounting is off
by a factor of four.

We try to approach this differently on the glibc side, as explained here:

  <https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Security%20Process>

But this policy, requiring actual application impact for (say)
denial-of-service vulnerabilities, does not match your past assignment
practice, or indeed general industry expectations.

Approaching this from a completely different angle: If glibc upstream
marks certain bugs as potential backport material due to their security
impact, without arranging for CVE assignment, how can we make such
assignments happen in time for downstream security updates?

I expected that you do not want Red Hat, Debian &c to assign CVE IDs for
already public issues.  Yet you have failed to provide such assignments
when they were requested, leading to CVE-less security updates such as
this one:

  <https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2015/09/msg00011.html>

Thanks, I will incorporate the assignments into the glibc bug tracker.

We still have a backlog of a few dozen issues fixed in previous releases
which are clearly vulnerabilities or have been referenced in downstream
security advisories.  We really should have a discussion about how to
handle them.  We can have it here, or in response to the multiple
messages I sent last fall.
