Subject: Re: Prime example of a can of worms

I finally got the article written and published, it's at:

https://securityblog.redhat.com/2016/01/20/primes-parameters-and-moduli/

TL;DR: I found a lot of messy problems and no really good solutions. But
ultimately we need to start using bigger keys/primes or this is all just a
waste of compute time (might as well go back to clear text).
