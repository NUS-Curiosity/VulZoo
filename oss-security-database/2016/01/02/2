Subject: CVE Request: PCRE Library Heap Overflow Vulnerability

Hello MITRE,

PCRE is a regular expression C library inspired by the regular expression
capabilities in the Perl programming language. The PCRE library is
incorporated into a number of prominent programs, such as Adobe Flash,
Apache, Nginx, PHP, KDE/Konqueror.

PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Heap Overflow.
During the compilation of a malformed regular expression, more data is
written on the malloced block than the expected size output by
compile_regex. Carefully crafted my lead to code execution in the context
of affected applications.

Please allocate a CVE-ID for this.
