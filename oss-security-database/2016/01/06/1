My mind is boggling at some of the logic involved here.

There is no potentially gaining access outside of the namespace when it
is access to things that were put inside the namespace.

The discussion was about how to make it easier for userspace not to do
stupid things, not how to fix a bug in the kernel.

The code we have been discussing most definitely does not make it safe
for a arbitrary root owned processes to call setns and enter a user
namespace with a hostile user namespace root.  You have to close file
descriptors, unmap files and do I don't know what else.  Properly
and safely dropping privileges is a challenging problem.

Calling bug because it is possible to use a kernel feature wrong feels
completely inappropriate.
