It is a pain but it is perfectly possible to:
	/* Mess with caps so the next line does not clear CAP_SYS_ADMIN */
	setresuid(container_root_uid, container_root_uid);
	setns(some_userns);

And it all works without issue.

It is a very reasonable extension and it makes it much harder to get it
all wrong.  But that is very different from saying the kernel today is
broken.

It really is the responsibility of the party that calls
setns(some_userns) to make certain their process does not have anything
you don't want the root user in the container to get his hands on.  That
goes way beyond the root uid.

In the original conversation about all of this the issue that was raised that
we might not know which process the user namespace belongs to and so
might not be able to call setresuid(container_root_uid, container_root_uid) 
ahead of time because of lack of knowledge.

I am concerned that the responsibility to not be stupid when you call
setns(some_userns) is being lost.
