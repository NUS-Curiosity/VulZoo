The writeup is ready since weeks, the first one is out already. The
user namespaces topic proved more problematic than initially thought:
two more local root privilege escalation variants were found,
overlayfs is vulnerable since enabled (e.g. Ubuntu Trusty up to now).

This was the first time, I tried to cooperate with others for fixing
via Linux distros instead only via Ubuntu and upstream, but even with
patch available, this did not speed up the process from discovery to
patching. So embargo time has ended but no patch available yet.

With that in mind, what would be best next steps for all those known
and also future issues?

As I know about the problems with uncoordinated full disclosure, but
bearing in mind, that full disclosure is also a method of enabling
those wanting to protect themselves, I am inclined to try this procedure:

* Send a pre-announce about 3 more userns related issues allowing
local root gain, thus proofing needs to audit the code more closely.

* Request developers to provide a mitigation workaround as kernel
module, that, as long as loaded a) disables userns as such or variant
b) just disables mounting within userns when not being host-uid-0.
Such a module should mitigate worst effects for production
environments but may leave other platforms (embedded? phones?)
unprotected.

* Module should be very simple to develop and perhaps distribute as
e.g. Ubuntu PPA addon-package to current kernel. So give whole public
2 days time for mitigation module.

* No matter if module is available or not (if not, that means that the
issues is irrelevant from security perspective). Hence full disclosure
cannot do any further harm.

Opinions?

PS: As the number of issues currently in processing are way too large
for sparetime handling, coordination is getting worse. So quite
likely, different parties might be out of sync already.
