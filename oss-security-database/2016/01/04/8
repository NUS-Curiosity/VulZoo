Subject: CVE Request: cacti: SQL injection vulnerability in graphs_new.php

Hi,

Another SQL injection vulnerability via graphs_new.php in cacti was
found, reported to the bug http://bugs.cacti.net/view.php?id=2652 .

No upstream commit to fix the issue is available yet.

This seems different to CVE-2015-8377, which was assigned for
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Dec/att-57/cacti_sqli%281%29.txt

Can you assign a CVE for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
