Subject: Linux kernel : Denial of service with specially crafted key file.

Gday,

I would like a CVE for the following issue:

An issue with ASN1.1 DER decoder was reported that a specially created key can lead to a kernel panic via x509 certificate DER signature parsing.

Vulnerable code:

...
int public_key_verify_signature(const struct public_key *pk,
                                const struct public_key_signature *sig)
{
        const struct public_key_algorithm *algo;

        BUG_ON(!pk);
        BUG_ON(!pk->mpi[0]);



An attacker could craft a BER file without a public key and panic the system.  

There is no patch upstream at the time of writing.
