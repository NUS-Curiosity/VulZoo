Subject: a bug in gif2rgb.c in giflib-5.1.2





We find a memory allocation whose size could be zero in gif2rgb.c. 
and It will result to several memory out of bound read and write. the bug in gif2rgb.c:386 :

386 if ((ScreenBuffer = (GifRowType *) 
387 malloc(GifFile->SHeight * sizeof(GifRowType))) == NULL) 
388 GIF_EXIT("Failed to allocate memory required, aborted.");


Please see "http://sourceforge.net/p/giflib/bugs/82/" for more details.
