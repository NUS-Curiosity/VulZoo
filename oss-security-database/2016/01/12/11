  Thank you.
 
| Note that http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=blob;f=hw/nvram/fw_cfg.c

|   {
|       /* nothing, write support removed in QEMU v2.4+ */
|   }

| and has no fw_cfg_read function.

  That's right. This issue affects Qemu versions prior to 2.4. Above change 
was made immediately after the release of v2.3.
