Do you have any further information about why this should be
considered a vulnerability in general? We realize that it might, at
least, be considered a vulnerability for Debian systems because of
"Tags: security" in the original report.

For example, is there a specific piece of data in the files that is
always supposed to be private?

https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=764645#5 indicates
that an unprivileged user can obtain information by directly opening
the files, but cannot obtain this information with an
"/sbin/iptables -L" command. This does not, by itself, establish that
a security feature has been defeated. It is possible that it was
simply inconvenient to implement the -L option in a way that provided
access to unprivileged users.

What we are trying to avoid is a situation in which CVE IDs are
assigned solely because a system administrator might not want files to
be readable by unprivileged users. For example, maybe someone would
prefer stricter /etc/hosts.allow permissions to prevent rogue local
users from discovering the names of other hosts that possibly have
symmetric "allow" policies.
