Unfortunately there are strong economic incentives for this kind of
behavior. scanning is a great example, you want to scan the Internet of
things, this is easy with IPv4 (just bulk scan the used public space which
is like 3 billion IPs) and basically impossible with IPv6. Simply leverage
the fact that these IoT things often connect out to NTP servers by default
using the pool.ntp.org servers. No matter what you do on the ntp.org pool
the people who want to scan will most likely be willing to spend time and
money to get at that data (hosting ntp servers, sniffing traffic to them,
etc.). Sadly what you need is business process to detect this activity (and
other forms of shenanigans) and then deal with the offender (e.g. remove
their ntp server from the pool).

Sadly we can't really rely on the IoT device makers to fix this, they have
basically 0 incentive to prevent scanners from hitting their products
(they're already sold, to late for the customer to make an informed
decision).

I'm also not sure that having scanners scan and publish these results is
such a bad thing, it raises awareness, and hopfully long term leads to
things like legislation that forces device makers to make safe devices
(e.g. no web interface with password "Admin").
