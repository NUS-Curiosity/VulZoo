Subject: CVE Request: FireBird RDBMS: authenticated clients crash FireBird
 when running gbak with invalid parameter

Hi,

The FireBird RDBMS can be crashed remotely by an authenticated client
by invoking gbak via the service manager using invalid command line
switch and lead to denial of service.

The issue was introduced in version 2.5.5.

Upstream report:
http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/CORE-5068

Upstream fix: 
http://sourceforge.net/p/firebird/code/62783/

Debian bug:
https://bugs.debian.org/810599

Can a CVE be assigned for his issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
