Subject: CVE-2015-7521: Apache Hive authorization bug disclosure

CVE-2015-7521: Apache Hive authorization bug disclosure

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Hive 1.0.0 - 1.0.1
Apache Hive 1.1.0 - 1.1.1
Apache Hive 1.2.0 - 1.2.1

Description:

Some partition-level operations exist that do not explicitly also
authorize privileges of the parent table. This can lead to issues when
the parent table would have denied the operation, but no denial occurs
because the partition-level privilege is not checked by the
authorization framework, which defines authorization entities only
from the table level upwards.

This issue is known to affect Hive clusters protected by both Ranger
as well as SqlStdHiveAuthorization.

Mitigation:

For Hive 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2, a separate jar is being made available,
which users can put in their ${HIVE_HOME}/lib/, and this provides a hook for
administrators to add to their hive-site.xml, by setting
hive.semantic.analyzer.hook=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.ParentTableAuthorizationHook .
This parameter is a comma-separated-list and this hook can be
appended to an existing list if one already exists in the setup. You
will then want to make sure that you protect the
hive.semantic.analyzer.hook parameter from being changed at runtime by
adding it to hive.conf.restricted.list.

This jar and associated source tarball are available for download
over at : https://hive.apache.org/downloads.html
along with their gpg-signed .asc signatures, as well as the md5sums
for verification in the hive-parent-auth-hook/ directory.

This issue has already been patched in all Hive branches that are
affected, and any future release will not need these mitigation steps.
