Subject: CVE request for radicale

Hi,

multiple security fixes were done in radicale (a calendar/contact server) 1.1,
released on dec 31st:

https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale/pull/343
http://radicale.org/news/#2015-12-31@11:54:03
https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=809920

Can CVE be assigned for those issues?

Thank in advance,
