Loading of multiple Windows system DLLs from the installers application
directory instead of Windows' system directory, a.k.a. DLL hijacking.

Well-known and well-documented for example in
<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/426.html>
<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427.html>
<https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/471.html>

On Windows 7:
    uxtheme.dll, winmm.dll, samcli.dll, msacm32.dll, version.dll, sfc.dll,
    sfc_os.dll, userenv.dll, profapi.dll, dwmapi.dll, mpr.dll

On other versions of Windows: a similar list.

regards
Stefan
