Subject: CVE request - Pulp < 2.3.0 shipped the same authentication CA key/cert to all users

Hello!

It was raised to my attention that a security issues that was resolved in 
Pulp 3 years ago should have had a CVE assigned to it:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1003326

To summarize, all Pulp users used the same internal CA key and cert for 
versions of Pulp < 2.3.0. This CA is used to generate a client certificate 
during the /login API call, and is trusted by httpd to authenticate users.

Though the issue is now long resolved, we would like a CVE number 
assigned to it for reference. Thanks!
