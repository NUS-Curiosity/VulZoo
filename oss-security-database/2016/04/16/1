Subject: CVE request: Varnish 3 before 3.0.7 was vulnerable to HTTP Smuggling
 issues: Double Content Length and bad EOL

Varnish 4.x serie is not impacted. Flaws Fixed in version 3.0.7 in march 2015.

Changelog is:
 * Requests with multiple Content-Length headers will now fail.
 * Stop recognizing a single CR (r) as a HTTP line separator. This
opened up a possible cache poisoning attack in stacked installations
where sslterminator/varnish/backend had different CR handling.

https://github.com/varnish/Varnish-Cache/commit/85e8468bec9416bd7e16b0d80cb820ecd2b330c3

Combinations of theses two flaws in HTTP protocol handling allows for
"HTTP Response Splitting" attacks
when another actor in front of Varnish3 can transmit headers in this
form (for example):

    Dummy: header\rContent-Length: 0\r\n

This is a one year old issue, on the old last release of this serie.
But we still find some installations. A CVE would maybe help removal
of 3.x installations, or at least upgrades to 3.0.7.
