Use CVE-2016-4353. (This CVE is about changing the type of error
handling after a decoder stack overflow. It is not about changing the
decoder so that a decoder stack overflow occurs in fewer cases.)


> Integer overflow in the BER decoder src/ber-decoder.c
> http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libksba.git;a=commit;h=aea7b6032865740478ca4b706850a5217f1c3887

We consider this two separate issues.

Use CVE-2016-4354 for the use of an incorrect integer data type.

Use CVE-2016-4355 for the cases in which the code was simply making no
attempt to check for an integer overflow (the "+ 100" cases and the
"+= d->val.length" case).


> Integer overflow in the DN decoder src/dn.c
> http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libksba.git;a=commit;h=243d12fdec66a4360fbb3e307a046b39b5b4ffc3

This might be an error in the original
https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201604-04 advisory. We did not notice
any obvious relationship between
243d12fdec66a4360fbb3e307a046b39b5b4ffc3 and an integer overflow fix.
The 243d12fdec66a4360fbb3e307a046b39b5b4ffc3 commit message seems to
focus on "read access out of bounds." Also, there is no other recent
commit at
http://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libksba.git;a=history;f=src/dn.c
that refers to an integer overflow. Possibly there was an inapplicable
copy-and-paste of "Integer overflow in the" from the previous report
about the BER decoder.

Use CVE-2016-4356 for the 243d12fdec66a4360fbb3e307a046b39b5b4ffc3
issue that is described as "Fix encoding of invalid utf-8 strings in
dn.c" and "read access out of bounds."
