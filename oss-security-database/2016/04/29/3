Subject: CVE request: Mplayer/Mencoder integer overflow parsing gif files

Hi,

A crash caused by an integer overflow parsing a gif was found in the last
revision of mplayer. It seems to affect older versions too. It was recently
fixed (r37857). Technical details and a reproducer are available here:

https://trac.mplayerhq.hu/ticket/2295
<https://github.com/stedolan/jq/issues/1136>

I verified that this issue affects mencoder, so you should check if you are
using it for conversion of gif files. This crash was found by QuickFuzz.

Regards,
Gustavo.
