Regardless of how difficult it is, we probably need to fix the bugs
somehow in Debian stable.  It looks like the commits are:

ea3d7209ca01 fix for PUNCH_HOLE (3.0+)
17048e8a083f fix for default fallocate (all) and ZERO_RANGE (3.15+)
32ebffd3bbb4 fix for COLLAPSE_RANGE (3.15+) and INSERT_RANGE (4.2+)
011278485ecc fix for PUNCH_HOLE (3.0+) and ZERO_RANGE (3.15+)

So the third would not be needed for stable branches up to 3.14 but
otherwise they're all needed (at least in part) for all live stable
branches - right?

(As there are clearly multiple bugs here; why only one CVE ID?)

Since I do most of the security backports for Debian, of course I am
interested.
