You are right -- I cannot think of a situation (or seems hard to find
a realistic example) right now where this issue would cross a
privilege boundary, and thus might just be considered as bug, but not
a vulnerability.

Thanks for your feedback, I'm fine to not have assigned an identifier
for this.
