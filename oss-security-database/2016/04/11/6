Subject: CVE Request: Qemu: net: buffer overflow in MIPSnet emulator

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the MIPSnet controller emulator is vulnerable to a 
buffer overflow issue. It could occur while receiving network packets in 
mipsnet_receive(), if the guest NIC is configured to accept large(MTU) 
packets.

A remote user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on a host, 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-04/msg01131.html

Reference:
----------
   -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1326082

This issue was discovered by Oleksandr Bazhaniuk of Advanced Threat Research
team at Intel Inc.

Thank you.
