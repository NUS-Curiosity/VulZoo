They weren't cc'ed stable because they're fairly complex patches,
which (a) means they probably wouldn't auto-apply anyway, and (b)
someone who does do the (probably manual) back port they would be
*very* strongly advised to run them through a complete ext4 regression
test series[1] to make sure the patches actually don't make things
worse from a stability perspective.

I do spend *small* amount of work testing the stable kernels (3.10,
3.14, 3.18, 4.1, 4.4) using gce-xfstests and backporting and testing
patches that weren't cc'ed to stable for various reasons.  It's a
pretty low priority task, though, and I'd really love to delegate this
to someone else.  I just don't have the bandwidth to support back
level kernels (this is why distributions get paid the big bucks), and
note that even if I or someone else stepped up, this won't necessarily
help Debian, which isn't on a one of the stable kernel versions.

If anyone is interested, please contact me.  Otherwise, I'll get to it
eventually.
