To my knowledge, none of the issues recently posted on this list have 
been addressed yet in libtiff.

It is always our priority to fix issues occuring in libtiff itself 
before addressing issues in the libtiff utilities.  Some of the 
libtiff maintainers care about only a few of the utilities.  We are 
all volunteers and available time is limited.

It is my intention to spend time addressing the libtiff utility issues 
(some of which might be due to issues in core libtiff) once I have 
addressed the remaining CVEs in GraphicsMagick.  Issues appearing to 
be due to problems in libtiff itself will get attention first.

Well-formulated source patches are welcomed for the issues.

Bob
