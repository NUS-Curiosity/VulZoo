Subject: 3 bugs refer to buffer overflow in in libtiff 4.0.6

Hello oss-security,


I did some test and found three bugs refer to buffer overflow: one stack buffer overflow in thumbnail and two buffer overflows in bmp2tiff. 


Please let me know whether CVE Identifier number could be assigned.


Overview:


Running each poc file crashes thumbnail and bmp2tiff made with AddressSanitizer in tiff-4.0.6. I have attached poc and log files . 


Steps to Reproduce:


1) download the source code of tiff-4.0.6 from url (http://download.osgeo.org/libtiff/tiff-4.0.6.tar.gz) and compile it with gcc AddressSanitizer
2) cd the directory where the bmp2tiff with Asan is and put a poc
3) run a poc file with bmp2tiff made with AddressSanitizer (ASan) in tiff-4.0.6
4) eg: ./bmp2tiff ./crashes/poc_745.bmp 1.tiff; ./bmp2tiff ./crashes/poc_775.bmp 1.tiff


Actual Results: The application thumbnail and bmp2tiff 4.0.6 crashed after run the poc. Asan detect crashes.
