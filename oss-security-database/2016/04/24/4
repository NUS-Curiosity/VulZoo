We do not feel that a stack-exhaustion attack against a command-line
program requires a CVE ID in all cases. A jq bug was discovered; the
question is whether it's a security bug. This depends on the existence
of a common use case in which an unattended process receives untrusted
JSON files, and (for example) the overall resource consumption is
substantially higher than what an attacker could achieve by submitting
a JSON file that is parsed without encountering any jq bugs.

Our understanding is that https://jqplay.org/ is an existence proof of
"unattended process receives untrusted JSON files." Also,
https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/ might imply that the . filter is
not expected to result in a lot of resource consumption (stack
exhaustion or anything else). So, a need for a CVE ID seems plausible;
however, we would like to have more information about security
relevance if anyone wants many CVE IDs for many different jq bugs
causing stack exhaustion.

Use CVE-2016-4074.
