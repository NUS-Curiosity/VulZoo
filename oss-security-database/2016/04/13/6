Subject: CVE request Qemu: i386: leakage of stack memory to guest in
 kvmvapic.c

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the Task Priority Register(TPR) optimizations for 
32-bit Windows guests, is vulnerable to a information leakage issue. It could 
occur while accessing Task Priority Register(TPR).

A privileged user/process inside guest could use this issue to leak host 
memory bytes.
