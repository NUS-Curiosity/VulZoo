As somebody else noted, it should be s/doesn't interpret/neutralizes/ or 
something. But that doesn't mean you should feel safe if you don't use 
-r.

For example, when git automatically spawns a pager, it puts R in the 
LESS environment variable. (That would be fine if git escaped \033 
before passing them to the pager, but it doesn't. Oddly, it does seem to 
escape other control characters.) Now, -R is less convenient than -r for 
hiding malicious code, but you could still set foreground and background 
to black in hope that the victim's terminal background is also black.

But even without -r or -R, one can use backspace characters to hide evil 
payload:

| $ less -FX hello.c
| #include <stdio.h>
| #include <stdlib.h>
|
| int main(int argc, char **argv)
| {
|         /* Copyright 2015-2016 Jakub Wilk */
|         printf("Hello world!\n");
|         return 0;
| }
|
| $ gcc -Wall hello.c -o hello && ./hello
