Subject: CVE request Qemu: net: out of bounds read in
 net_checksum_calculate

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the IP checksum routines is vulnerable to an OOB read 
access issue. It could occur while computing checksum for TCP/UDP packets, as 
the function uses payload length from the packet without checking against the 
data buffer size.

A user inside guest could use this flaw to read excessive bytes or crash the 
Qemu process resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-03/msg00671.html

Reference:
----------
   -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1296567

This issue was discovered by Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.

Thank you.
