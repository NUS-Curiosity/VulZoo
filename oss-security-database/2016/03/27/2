Additional information for this request: The issue seems to have been
introduced with http://vcs.pcre.org/pcre?view=revision&revision=1434
in 8.35.

Note that upstream of suricata tracks the issue in suricata in
conjunction with pcre 8.35 with
https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/1693
to issue a warning.

Salvatore
