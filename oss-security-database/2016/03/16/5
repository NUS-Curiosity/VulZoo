7.2p2 includes the fix, but it's not the first version that includes
it.  I see it documented in 7.2 release:

http://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.2

 * ssh(1): eliminate fallback from untrusted X11 forwarding to
   trusted forwarding when the X server disables the SECURITY
   extension.

and patches included in 7.2p1 already.
