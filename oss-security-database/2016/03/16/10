One thing to keep in mind, once the source code is updated publicly the cat
is usually out of the bag (people that read the code commit can understand
the security implications typically). So as far as I'm concerned that while
inconvenient, what you did isn't really all that wrong (ideally git
upstream should have notified distros with a heads up, but again, that's an
optional step).

If you need help handling a vulnerability/coordinating the embargo/etc you
can reach out to Red Hat and we can at least point you in the right
direction, if not directly help ourselves (e.g. if we ship it we're more
than happy to help!), secalert@...hat.com for that.
