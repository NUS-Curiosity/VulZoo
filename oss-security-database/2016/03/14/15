Why should these get a CVE?  As you state in one of your reports:

  While I appreciate that passing untrusted code to gawk is not a
  common thing to do, I do not believe that it should be possible to
  trigger a segfault though.

Why should that be considered a valid / safe use case at all?  If
something makes awk run untrusted programs, there's code execution
problem already:

  echo | awk '{ system("id") }'
