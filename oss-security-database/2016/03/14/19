Subject: Re: Re: CVE-Request - GNU Awk.

Is a SIGSEGV on it's own enough to justify a CVE? For some apps the answer
would be yes (e.g. a single threaded network service that crashes out). For
something like gawk I'm not so sure, it's a local utility that shouldn't
really be processing network data/untrusted data, but then I would have
said the same thing about bash (and then shellshock happened). I'm inclined
to err on the side of caution and give it an identifier, if nothing else
people using gawk on potentially dangerous input are more likely to see
this issue and check their scripts/etc. If Mitre doesn't give it a CVE I
can assign a DWF identifier to it.
