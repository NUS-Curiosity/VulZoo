Subject: CVE-Request - GNU Awk.


  I reported two DoS bugs against GNU Awk to the debian
 bug tracker recently, both of which are denial of service
 attacks causing NULL-pointer deferences.

  It would be useful to have a CVE identifiers assigned.

  The two issues can be demonstrated like so :

    echo | gawk  '{ print( @olower( "steve" ) ) }'

    echo | gawk 'for (i = ) in foo bar baz'

  There are potential patches and further diagnostics on
 the bug reports themselves which are respectively:

    https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=816271

    https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=816277
