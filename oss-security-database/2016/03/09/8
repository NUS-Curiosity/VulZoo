Subject: Heap use after free in Pidgin-OTR plugin

https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/39-Heap-use-after-free-in-Pidgin-OTR-plugin.html

The pidgin-otr plugin version 4.0.2 fixes a heap use after free error.
The bug is triggered when a user tries to authenticate a buddy and
happens in the function create_smp_dialog.

The bug was discovered with Address Sanitizer. This is yet another
example why all C/C++ code should be tested with Address Sanitizer
enabled.

This bug was already independently discovered and reported in the otr
bug tracker.
https://bugs.otr.im/issues/88

Independend of this bug another more severe bug in Libotr itself was
also disclosed today, please make sure you update both libotr (4.1.1)
and the pidgin-otr plugin (4.0.2).
