Thanks David for finding the right people and raising the issue with
them.  I'm sure media coverage is probably helping as well:
  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/09/hackers_spin_up_alternative_cve_system_as_bugs_go_unchecked/

Suppose MITRE fixes their issues tomorrow and the CVE goes back to the
way it was.  Is that really want we need going forward?  A system
that's based on sending emails between humans and posting only
one-line descriptions with a series of links (half of which are broken
after a short time)?  A system which tries to distribute the load by
using "big" software vendors, many of whom have a vested interest in
limiting what vulnerabilities get published in their software?

It seems like we can do better than this.  Infosec hasn't been
"working" for some time.  Perhaps we need better tools to help us get
ahead of the game.
