Subject: Re: [exact-image] Missing fixes for CVEs in upstream dcraw

Hi Charles,

I do not remember adding anything special to just disable dcraw.

The most straight forward would be to comment it out in the Makefile via NOT_SRCS while building.

If you the CVE has a test case I can include the test case and fix in the exact-iamge source tree.

Greetings,
	René
