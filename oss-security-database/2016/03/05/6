That's also the case for me, I gave up trying to assign CVE's a long time
ago. It's not that Mitre are not adding value, I can see the benefit of a
carefully curated list. The problem is that they're a big bottleneck in what
is an already painful process. I started the process of becoming a CNA once
to try and alleviate some of the delays, but that process was even more
painful and I gave up after a few months (this was a long time ago).

I'd only start using CVE identifiers again if they're assigned instantly,
and the curation is non-blocking.
