You can mount the file system with "mount -o errors=continue" and this
will override the default behavior specified in the super block.

I would argue that a Desktop or server system that had automount
should either (a) mount with -o errors=continue, or (b) force an fsck
on the file system before mounting it.

So I think this is a particularly meaningless CVE, which is why I have
zero respect for people who try to make any kind of conclusion based
on CVE counts.   I certainly don't plan to do anything about this.

You might as well complain that since the system ships with a reboot
command that can be executed by a clueless root user, that this is a
potential DOS attack scenario deserving of a CVE....
