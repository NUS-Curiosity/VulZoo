The problem is that:

a) means I'll be mounting filesystems with errors that I may want to know
about (but not have my  system panic about)

b) fsck takes a long time on large disks (the smallest size of disk I buy
for USB drives is 1TB, if I fsck every time I plug one in I'll die of old
age).

As for your comments on CVE counting even the then head of CVE @mitre told
people not to rely on CVE counting for vulnerability stats:

As for your comment on not fixing this: I think fundamentally I should be
able to plug a file system in and try to mount it with default/reasonable
options and NOT have my system panic. File system handling code, like any
code that handles user supplied data should be able to handle garbage
gracefully and securely. At worst it should try to mount and go "derp, it's
messed up, maybe fsck it?"
