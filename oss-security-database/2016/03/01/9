Debian did most of that work for SSLv2 years ago. Quite a lot was
upstreamed and a bunch more in patches, this really made it easier
to disable SSLv2 support in OpenSSL when we did it in OpenBSD.

There shouldn't be all that many left for SSLv2. There are a number
of patches in OpenBSD ports for SSLv*3* removal, some upstreamed -
if OS/distros are already going through ABI change pain at this
point to drop SSLv2, why not go the whole hog and drop v3 as well
while you're at it?
