Subject: CVE request: Kryo (Java serialization API)

The Kryo serialization API (https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo)
doesnÂ¹t enforce whitelisting by default, and thus allows side effects from
constructors and finalizer methods in attacker-chosen types when
deserializing. With the right gadgets available on the classpath, these
side effects could lead to DoS, memory corruption, and possibly RCE.
