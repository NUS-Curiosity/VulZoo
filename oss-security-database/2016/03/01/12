Subject: Re: CVE's for SSLv2 support

Ok let me simplify:

If a crypto library (e.g. OpenSSL, NSS) supports AND enables SSLv2 by
default should it receive a CVE? Essentially we'd be saying "SSLv2 is so
bad, that supporting/enabling it by default in a crypto library is CVE
worthy" (essentially under the CVE assignment for "product makes a security
claim that it fails to do properly").
