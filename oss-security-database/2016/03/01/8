Yes, with SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 being the next.

The problem is more wide, as it's in the use of insecure algorithms.

Yes. Including, but not limited to:
1. RSA keys of less than 4096 bits (a minimum of 8192 should be
recommended).
2. Non-EC discrete logarithm based algos (DSA, old GOST 34.10-94).
2. EC-based algos with keys of less than 256 bits (as for me, I'd
consider 1024 bits to be an absolute minimum: chips are cheap, but
the energy is still expensive).
3. Symmetric ciphers in any mode other than CFB or counter-based.
4. Symmetric ciphers with key size of less than 256 bits.
5. Hash functions of less than 256 bits.
