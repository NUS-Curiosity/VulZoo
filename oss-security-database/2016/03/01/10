We understand that the listed patches are to be used together, but the
changes were announced at different times and thus multiple CVE IDs
are needed.

There are all about the same code changes, originally written in March
2015. The issue appears to have security relevance on its own. Use
CVE-2015-8817.


> http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=e4a511f8cc6f4a46d409fb5c9f72c38ba45f8d83

As far as we can tell, this is a functionality fix, not a security
fix. It doesn't have a CVE ID. (We understand that it does belong in
the listed set of upstream commits anyway.)

> http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=965eb2fcdfe919ecced6c34803535ad32dc1249c

As far as we can tell, this one isn't really a security fix and may
have introduced new bugs that were addressed later. It also doesn't
have a CVE ID. (We understand that it does belong in the listed set of
upstream commits anyway.)


> http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=b242e0e0e2969c044a318e56f7988bbd84de1f63

This one is from July 2015 and has security relevance on its own. Use
CVE-2015-8818.
