Subject: CVE request Qemu: rng-random: arbitrary stack based allocation
 leading to corruption

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the Pseudo Random Number Generator(PRNG) back-end 
support is vulnerable to an arbitrary stack based allocation and memory 
corruption via random bytes issue. It could occur when a guest requests for 
entropy for random number generation.

A user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=60253ed1e6ec6d8e5ef2efe7bf755f475dce9956

Thank you.
