I'm not entirely sure that CVE is the right vehicle to express the issue. 
Exploitation of this would be an attacker uses code to exploit a poor 
implementation or design problem. There are code weaknesses tracked by CWE, 
vulnerabilities in implementations tracked by CVE, and attacks tracked by 
CAPEC. They reference each other as follows CAPEC->CVE->CWE.

Maybe a CWE somewhere in this category is what you are after:
