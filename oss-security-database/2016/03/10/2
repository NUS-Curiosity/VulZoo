Subject: [OSSA 2016-007.1] Nova host data leak through resize/migration
 (CVE-2016-2140) ERRATA

=============================================================
OSSA-2016-007.1: Nova host data leak through resize/migration
=============================================================

:Date: March 08, 2016
:CVE: CVE-2016-2140


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Nova: <=2015.1.3, >=12.0.0 <=12.0.2


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Matthew Booth from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova instance
resize/migration. By overwriting an ephemeral or root disk with a
malicious image before requesting a resize, an authenticated user may
be able to read arbitrary files from the compute host. Only setups
using libvirt driver with raw storage and setting "use_cow_images =
False" (not default) are affected.


Errata
~~~~~~
The former fix did not take into account the usage of non-disk-image
backends and caused a regression for this use-case. This update
provides an additional fix for that issue.
