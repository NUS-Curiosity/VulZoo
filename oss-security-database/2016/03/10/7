It likely needs two, one for the issue above,
which has been proposed to be addressed by
http://marc.info/?l=netfilter-devel&m=145757134822741&w=2

and one for the unsigned integer overflow on 32bit kernels
mentioned as an aside at the end of the original report. Proposed
fix is http://marc.info/?l=netfilter-devel&m=145757136822750&w=2

Thanks.
