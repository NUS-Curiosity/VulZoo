Subject: RE: Concerns about CVE coverage shrinking -
 direct impact to researchers/companies

Could this process be a whole lot less opaque? It seems there are more smart people outside the room who would love to participate, help, etc. than are inside MITRE.
Maybe this whole thing could be turned into a public/private partnership with one of the larger  groups, OSI, Linux Foundation, etc.

Hi Kurt and David,  

The CVE team is holding a series of internal meetings related to the referenced issues, including one tomorrow. There is not a meeting with the Editorial Board (or a subset of Editorial Board members) scheduled for or being held tomorrow.  

We would like to propose an Editorial Board meeting to address issues related to CVE operations, scalability, and community feedback, as was first suggested by Kent Landfield on January 5, 2016. (Full discussion thread available at: http://common-vulnerabilities-and-exposures-cve-editorial-board.1128451.n5.nabble.com/CVE-Advancements-tt81.html)  

The internal meetings referenced above will enable us to come to that Editorial Board meeting with specific recommendations and proposed next steps.  

Best Regards,  
The MITRE CVE Team

This is literally the first I'm hearing of this, will any board members be  
present?
