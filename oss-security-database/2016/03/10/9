Subject: Announce: Portable OpenSSH 7.2p2 released

Portable OpenSSH 7.2p2 has just been released. It will be available
from the mirrors listed at http://www.openssh.com/ shortly.

OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and
includes sftp client and server support. OpenSSH also includes
transitional support for the legacy SSH 1.3 and 1.5 protocols that
may be enabled at compile-time.

Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for
their continued support of the project, especially those who
contributed code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or
donated to the project. More information on donations may be found
at: http://www.openssh.com/donations.html

Changes since OpenSSH 7.2p1
===========================

This release fixes a security bug:

 * sshd(8): sanitise X11 authentication credentials to avoid xauth
   command injection when X11Forwarding is enabled.

   Full details of the vulnerability are available at:
   http://www.openssh.com/txt/x11fwd.adv

Checksums:
==========

 - SHA1 (openssh-7.2p2.tar.gz) = 70e35d7d6386fe08abbd823b3a12a3ca44ac6d38
 - SHA256 (openssh-7.2p2.tar.gz) = pyeB0aBDh2oiT/GwAy2qQJTYdWWmhSh1nBwsq1SCVIw=
