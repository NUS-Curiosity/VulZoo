Subject: CVE request -- linux kernel: crash on invalid USB device
 descriptors (ims-pcu driver)

Hello,

If possible, we would like to obtain a CVE-ID for the following
securuty flaw.

A device pretending to be a device driven by the ims-pcu driver,
but leaving out either of the two interfaces present on the genuine
device will crash the driver and possibly the kernel. Thus, DoS
with physical access is possible. Kernels since v3.10 are vulnerable.

Initial reference with a proposed fix:
