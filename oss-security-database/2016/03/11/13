So I don't know the exact details but broadly speaking Mitre handle a lot
of US government projects, and one of Mitre's mandates is cyber security,
so under that mandate the us Gov (specifically the DHS as I understand it)
has funded several projects, such as CVE. So CVE is something Mite
administers, and is paid to do so through US Gov funding. It's not like CVE
is some profitable product that Mitre sells. So Mitre has to work within
the funding constraints of the government, it's not like they can trivially
allocate 10 million a year to it internally.

CC'ing Stephen Boyle, if I said something completely wrong please, please
correct me =).
