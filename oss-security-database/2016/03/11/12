Subject: Several out of bounds reads in ProFTPD

https://blog.fuzzing-project.org/40-Several-out-of-bounds-reads-in-ProFTPD.html

The latest releases of ProFTPD 1.3.5a and 1.3.6rc2 fix several out of
bounds read issues. I discovered these issues by running the test suite
with Address Sanitizer enabled.

An invalid off by one read can happen in the function pr_fs_dircat().
This affects both 1.3.5a and 1.3.6rc1 and earlier.

Git commit / fix

An invalid off by one read can happen in the string handling function
pr_ascii_ftp_to_crlf(). This code is not present in the stable 1.3.5
release series and only affects 1.3.6 release candidates before rc2.

Git commit / fix

A missing null termination of a string causes an out of bounds memory
read in a test. This does not affect the ProFTPD code itself, it's just
an issue in the test suite.
