A few people said they felt sorry about that, but I think this is
actually OK.

I had thought of that and decided to do without it for now.  (Also
considered captcha.)  I like to emphasize how very easy it is to obtain
OVE IDs.  Not even having to click a button serves that goal well.

I don't mind adding a button a bit later, though.  We'll see.

This is currently available through OVE IDs themselves - they are
sequential, starting with 0001 at midnight UTC.

As it is, it should survive quite a few thousand of unique IPs per day
(and yes, it temporarily records per IP address statistics, and it has
per-IP and per-netblock limits), before (gradually) denying service for
the rest of the day.  It might or might not survive a Slashdot-alike
event, but even if not then waiting a day for the next batch of IDs is
quicker than waiting weeks for CVE IDs.

BTW, there is not a hard-coded limit of 9999.  There is logic in place
to try and keep the daily IDs within 9999 (the service becomes less
generous as the 4-digit space gets closer to being exhausted), but if
the requests and unique IPs are too numerous this may be crossed anyway,
resulting in 5- or 6-digit IDs (and going back to 4-digit the next day).
