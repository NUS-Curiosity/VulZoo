 impact to researchers/companies

I am also sailing on the same boat. Thanks for raising this question. I
reported multiple advisories to oss-sec and cve-assign. Never got even a
single reply. Even, I saw, CVE-ID was assigned to same product for similar
vulnerability few years back. Now, I eschew requesting CVE.
