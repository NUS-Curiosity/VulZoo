Hmmm... sorry to say, but I've garbaged 21 IDs by simply visiting
this page and reloading it twice just to see what would happen :-)

So I'd suggest adding a BRB (Big Red Button) for those who actually
need an ID, and displaying some statistics ("1234 IDs were assigned
today") for everyone else.

Style suggestion:

[form action='.' method='post']
[input style='background:red;color:white;padding:16px;font-size:32px'
name='request' value='GET ID' type='submit']
[/form]

Looks nice for me.

Yes. So prepare for the above link to become really popular.
