Subject: Re: Concerns about CVE coverage shrinking - direct
 impact to researchers/companies

I totally agree.
The concern addressed by Kurt initially is fully valid (for both
researchers and for companies that are not on Mitre's product/sources
list), so a new (better: additional) solution is required.
However, creating a new standard independently of CVE would be too
disruptive and be a disservice to the software industry.
I'd propose to work out a new solution together with Mitre, whilst
keeping the CVE IDs as today.
Since 2014, virtually unlimited number of CVE IDs can be assigned per
year [1], so a solution could be that
 - Mitre continues to assign 4 and 5 digit IDs as today
 - 6 digit IDs are reserved for the new process (hosted outside Mitre)
If more than one million vulnerabilities need to be addressed in one
year, we could follow the rule (odd digits -> Mitre, even digits ->
"other process")
>From Mitre's POC, this "other process" would become a "CNA", just with
its own policy and process definition, not prescribed by Mitre.
It would soon become clear to everyone (and all tools and products that
rely on CVE) where to look at for the authoritative vulnerability
information.

And yes: OWASP.org could certainly be a perfect host for that new "CNA"
- as Mark offered earlier ;-)

Like Goodwin's Law, which states that the longer an online conversation continues, the probability that it will involve Nazi analogies reaches 1, Munroe's Law says that eventually any conversation about an existing standard reaches no conclusions other than to create a new standard.
