Subject: cve request: systemd-machined: information exposure for docker
 containers

Once docker containers register themselves to systemd-machined
by oci-register-machine. Any unprivileged user could run
machinectl to list every single containers running in the host
even if the containers do not belong to this user (including containers
belong to the root user), and access sensitive information associated
with any individual container including its internal IP address, OS
version, running processes, and file path for its rootfs.

$ machinectl status cc8d10c7b9892b75843d200d54d34a3a
