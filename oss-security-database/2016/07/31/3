First off, it is not an "exploit", is is "working as designed". :)

Not really, that device just acts like the USB device it said it is (a
keyboard).  This device has been around for years and is very useful for
development efforts.

So can your USB keyboard :)

Anyway, Linux (the kernel), provides you the abilities to disable all
USB devices and only enable the ones you deem "safe", whenever you
decide to.  It is up to you how you determine this.  By default, most
Linux distros do not enable this option for obvious reasons.

No, that's your distro's decision, many enable it by default.

Anyway, best of luck, but this is a distro-specific issue and I suggest
working with your distro to enable that option by default if you so
desire it.
