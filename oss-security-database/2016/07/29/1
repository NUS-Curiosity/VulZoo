The bug comes from the fuzzer, which did not pass an empty file.
Later, I discovered that an empty file has the same behaviour of 
the crafted.

In other words:
- The same crash happen for the empty and crafted file.
- The patch covers both cases (when the file is empty and when 
contains random data).
