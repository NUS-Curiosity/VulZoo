Subject: CVE request: Jenkins plugin 'Cucumber Reports' 1.3.0 to 2.5.1 disabled XSS protection mechanism

Hello,

Please assign a CVE to this issue:

Cucumber Reports Plugin disables Content-Security-Policy for archived and workspace files

Jenkins 1.641 and 1.625.3 introduced Content-Security-Policy HTTP headers as protection against Cross-Site Scripting attacks using workspace files and archived artifacts served using DirectoryBrowserSupport (SECURITY-95). The Cucumber Reports Plugin disabled this XSS protection until Jenkins was restarted whenever a Cucumber Report was viewed by any user to work around the Content-Security-Policy limitations.

Affected versions
Cucumber Reports Plugin 1.3.0 to 2.5.1 (inclusive).

Fix
Users of Cucumber Reports Plugin should update it to version 2.6.0 or newer.

Thanks!

Daniel
