Subject: CVE-2016-5412 Kernel: powerpc: kvm: Infinite loop via H_CEDE hypercall
 when running under hypervisor-mode

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with for the PowerPC platform with KVM Virtualisation with 
hypervisor-mode support(CONFIG_KVM_BOOK3S_64_HV) enabled is vulnerable to a 
DoS issue. It could occur if a guest kernel running under hypervisor-mode KVM 
(i.e. "HV KVM" rather than "PR KVM"), does the H_CEDE hypercall while a 
suspended transaction exists, the host CPU may, under certain circumstances, 
hang in an infinite loop with interrupts disabled.

A user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the host kernel 
resulting in DoS.
