Subject: paps: heap overflow when processing crafted file

Hello,

it was discovered during fuzzing that a crafted file causes an heap overflow 
in paps ( https://sourceforge.net/projects/paps/ ).

Details, included stracktrace at:
https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/07/28/paps-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-read_file-paps-c/


If it is suitable for a CVE, please assign one.

Thanks.
