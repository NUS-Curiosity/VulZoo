Subject: CVE Request: perl: XSLoader: could load shared library from
 incorrect location

Hi,

Jakub Wilk reported in [1] that the Perl module List::MoreUtils tried
to load code from a subdirectory of the current working directory
despite explicitly removing the current directory from @INC, which
could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if cwd is unstrusted, as
demonstrated in the bugreport.

While analyzing the issue[2], it turns out that the issue is actually in
XSLoader, which uses caller() information to locate the .so file to
load. This can be incorrect if XSLoader::load() is called in a string
eval. The fix commited upstream is [3].

@MITRE: Could you please assign a CVE for this issue in XSLoader? Do
you think List::MoreUtils needs a separate CVE as well, despite the
underlying issue lying in XSLoader[4]?

Regards,
Salvatore
