Thanks for your review -- Play is proactive about security, but does
rely on the integrity of the browser to implement key security features
(CORS, Same Origin Policy, security headers, etc) for that functionality.

Regarding your other questions, Play Framework ("Play" for short) is an
open source project -- the source code is owned and licensed by
Lightbend.  You can read more about it here:

https://www.playframework.com/community-process#Implementation-decisions

For reference, there is a mailing list for reporting vulnerabilities at
security@...yframework.org.

The mailing list for receiving Play Framework security announcements is
at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/play-framework-security

And the HTML page for viewing Play security advisories reports is at

Thanks,
