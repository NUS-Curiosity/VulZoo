Possibly the concern is that the utmp entry might have a spoofed
username associated with the correct uid, and the attacker's goal is
to obtain unauthorized group privileges. We have not studied the code
in detail, but shadow-4.2.1/src/newgrp.c seems to have this sequence
of calls:

  pwd = get_my_pwent ();
     [ note that this calls getlogin ]
  grp = xgetgrgid (pwd->pw_gid);
  gid = grp->gr_gid;
  setgid (gid)

Use CVE-2016-6251 for the potentially unsafe use of getlogin.

shadow-4.2.1/src/Makefile.in has:

  suidubins = chage chfn chsh expiry gpasswd newgrp passwd newuidmap newgidmap

Use CVE-2016-6252 for the incorrect integer handling.
