Subject: Malicious primary DNS servers can crash secondaries

It turns out that most DNS server implementations do not implement 
reasonable restrictions for zone sizes.  This allows an explicitly 
configured primary DNS server for a zone to crash a secondary DNS 
server, affecting service of other zones hosted on the same secondary 
server.

PowerDNS is reportedly affected as well, but I did not find a public bug 
for this issue.
