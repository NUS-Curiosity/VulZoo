We think additional information would help in deciding whether this is
commonly recognized as a Play Framework vulnerability (which would
have a CVE ID) or Play Framework security hardening (which would not
have a CVE ID). Our understanding thus far is:

  - Play Framework is not an Atlassian product

  - https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/5527#discussion-diff-51786858
    says "In order to make Play's CSRF filter more resilient to
    browser plugin vulnerabilities and new extensions, the default
    configuration for the CSRF filter has been made far more
    conservative."

  - Chromium issue 490015 has some debate about whether it is a
    Chrome/Chromium vulnerability, e.g., "The issue is whether it's
    the browser responsibility to act as a nanny to weak websites, or
    we should leave weak websites as sacrifice for great justice."
    versus "To be clear, this is a security bug ... There is a
    security bug in Chrome, but no action is being done."

Typically, it would be best not to have a CVE for Play Framework if
the essence of the Play Framework problem is "the product did not
proactively add workarounds for all browser-level vulnerabilities that
might be discovered later."
