 shadow package

Hi,

While this is not immediately clear from the Shadow homepage the
development continued on GitHub where I have opened two issues
for the two potential security problems:

Incorrect integer handling CVE-2016-6252:
https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/issues/27

Potentially unsafe use of getlogin CVE-2016-6251:
https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/issues/28

Probably upstream's issue tracker would be the best place
to discuss the fixes in detail. With upstream development
happening on GitHub the pkg-shadow-devel list could host
mostly Debian-packaging releated discussions and probably
not all oss-security subscribers would like to get all the
messages.

Cheers,
Balint
