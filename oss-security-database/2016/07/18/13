Subject: libupnp write files via POST

Hi,

Wanted to point out this report by Matthew Garret (not sure if there's
anything else than a couple of tweets public):
https://twitter.com/mjg59/status/755062278513319936

Notable:
"Reported this to upstream 8 months ago without response, so: libupnp's
default behaviour allows anyone to write to your filesystem"
"Seriously. Find a device running a libupnp based server (Shodan says
there's rather a lot), and POST a file to /testfile. Then GET /testfile"
"…and yeah if the server is running as root (it is) and is using / as
the web root (probably not, but maybe) this gives full host fs access"

And later on:
"Emailed the Debian security team a couple of months ago, no response"

Not good...
