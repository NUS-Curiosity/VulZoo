More to the point to quote myself:

Please note that the "Proxy" header is not an official standard header, nor
is it in the provisional header registry. The "Proxy" header should not be
used by any standards compliant applications or clients.

Case in point:

http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml

You will note that the "Proxy" header is not there. It's a common
convention to support it, and as it turns out, a bad one (seriously, in
what use case do you want to let a client specify the proxy that a server
then uses to handle outgoing requests?). We also asked several large web
CDN firms to check their logs for the "Proxy" header, and none reported
seeing it used in the wild. Literally the only use case for this header now
is for attackers.
