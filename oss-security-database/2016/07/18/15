Certificates being actually verified doesn't help against use of this
trick for host/port scanning or DoS attacks on third-parties.  What does
fully defeat this vulnerability is if the application or library only
checks a different env var like HTTPS_PROXY for HTTPS connections.  So I
guess whether use of HTTPS fully defeats or partially mitigates the
issue varies by the application or library invoked from a CGI program.
