Subject: CVE Requests: HarfBuzz - Chromium CVE issues

Hello,

Google released a chromium advisory[0], in which a bunch of harfbuzz
issues were mentioned. However only one CVE was assigned to multiple
issues as per https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=544270


Looking a bit into the attached bug and going a few links down, i
realized that there are atleast 3 issues in here which are CVE worthy.
Details as follows:

1. Heap based buffer overflow:
https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz/issues/139#issuecomment-146984679

2. Fix hmtx wrong table length check:
https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz/issues/139#issuecomment-148289957

3. heap-buffer-overflow in hb_ot_face_metrics_accelerator_t::get_advance
https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz/issues/156

Can MITRE please assign CVEs to these issues?

Also, assuming we still have a policy of one issue one CVE, how does
MITRE plan to handle vendors who assign one CVE to multiple non-related
issues?
