Subject: CVE request for the Play Framework

In version 2.5.0 of the Play Framework a CSRF bypass that depends upon
an implementation bug in chrome's beacon api[0][1] was fixed.

The issue was that the Play Framework's CSRF implementation could be
bypassed in chrome in certain situations using Beacon requests because
the framework assumed that it is only possible to send what is
considered a simple request cross-domain. In other words the framework
assumed that POST requests with a content-type of
application/x-www-form-urlencoded or text/plain or multipart/form-data
need to have CSRF checks applied and requests with any other
content-type need not be checked.

The Beacon (sendBeacon) https://w3c.github.io/beacon/ implementation
in chrome[0][1] currently allows requests to be sent cross-domain with
non-simple content-types. That is, it is possible to send a post
request with a content-type of "application/json" (or any arbitrary
content type of an attacker's choice) from an attacker's site (e.g.
https://attacker.com) to https://example.com in chrome through
executing the following javascript:

var payload = '{"key": "value"}';
navigator.sendBeacon('https://example.com', new Blob([payload], {type:
'application/json'}));


The fix can be found at
https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/5608 in commit
7e52bd5f37a4b7b8fd154551d31940a125d81054
(https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/5608/commits/7e52bd5f37a4b7b8fd154551d31940a125d81054).



Can a CVE be assigned for this issue?


[0] - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=490015#c8
[1] https://github.com/w3c/beacon/pull/23/ clarified when
implementations of the Beacon API need to first make a CORS preflight
request (when non-simple content-types are sent cross-domain using the
beacon api then a CORS preflight request needs to be sent first).
