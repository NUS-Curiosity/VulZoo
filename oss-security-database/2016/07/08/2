Thank you for your reply.

I had inverse publishing the issues, apart from #3670 as the fix was released just recently.

I'm not requesting on behalf of the Inverse team ("from by own perspective"). Inverse already confirmed the issues (and fixed most of them), but SOGo has a history of missing CVEs even for nasty issues.

The issues was resolved by limiting the upload size, which _also_ was a feature request (but now got important due to the possible DOS attack). Further investigation showed that not memcached was the issue but temporary files kept around, but the rest of the argument stayed the same.

These have been two different issues within related code, that have been resolved together:

1. Not all private information removed for the public free/busy view
2. It was possible to join appointments based on the UID of the public free/busy view from different users, to know who has appointments with whom

I duplicated the line by accident.

The (now public) issue log says I realized the issue also exists with contacts, and the CSS stuff was not an additional attack vector, but a regression fix.
