Subject: [ANNOUNCE][CVE-2016-5019] Apache MyFaces Trinidad 1.2.15 released

The Apache MyFaces team is pleased to announce the release of Apache
MyFaces Trinidad 1.2.15.

MyFaces Trinidad is a feature-rich renderkit for JavaServer(tm) Faces
that provides an extendibles framework and extensive skinning support.
This version is designed to be used with the JSF 1.2 specification and
works with either Mojarra or MyFaces.

CVE-2016-5019:
Trinidad’s CoreResponseStateManager both reads and writes view state
strings using
ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream directly.  By doing so, Trinidad
bypasses the
view state security features provided by the JSF implementations - ie. the view
state is not encrypted and is not MAC’ed.  Trinidad’s
CoreResponseStateManager will
blindly deserialize untrusted view state strings, which makes Trinidad-based
applications vulnerable to deserialization attacks.

Apache MyFaces Trinidad is available in both binary and source
distributions, and there are examples available as well:

    * http://myfaces.apache.org/trinidad/download.html

Apache MyFaces Trinidad is available in the central Maven repository
under Group ID "org.apache.myfaces.trinidad"
