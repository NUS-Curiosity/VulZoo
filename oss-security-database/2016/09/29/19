 buffer write

Hi,

Just quick:
This is a very typical bug class that libfuzzer can find very well.
libfuzzer is like afl, but for functions instead of executables.

I have attached a sample code for libfuzzer which shows how this works.
(In case anyone cares: Consider it being public domain / CC0 / whatever
licensing terms you like)

Takes only a few seconds without any starting corpus to find this bug.
