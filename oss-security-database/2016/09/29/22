Subject: [ANNOUNCE][CVE-2016-5019] Apache MyFaces Trinidad 2.1.2 released

The Apache MyFaces team is pleased to announce the release of Apache
MyFaces Trinidad 2.1.2.
.
MyFaces Trinidad is a feature-rich renderkit for JavaServer(tm) Faces
that provides an extendibles framework and extensive skinning support.
This version is designed to be used with the JSF 2.1 specification.

CVE-2016-5019:
Trinidad’s CoreResponseStateManager both reads and writes view state
strings using
ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream directly.  By doing so, Trinidad
bypasses the
view state security features provided by the JSF implementations - ie. the view
state is not encrypted and is not MAC’ed.  Trinidad’s
CoreResponseStateManager will
blindly deserialize untrusted view state strings, which makes Trinidad-based
applications vulnerable to deserialization attacks.

Apache MyFaces Trinidad is available in both binary and source
distributions, and there are examples available as well:

    * http://myfaces.apache.org/trinidad/download.html

Apache MyFaces Trinidad is available in the central Maven repository
under Group ID "org.apache.myfaces.trinidad"
