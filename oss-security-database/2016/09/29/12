Note, this was fixed many months ago, in May of 2016, and went into the
stable kernel updates in June, 2016.  Any distro that updated to the
stable kernel updates received this fix then.

Any distro that hasn't updated their kernel since then, well, you need
to revaluate your trust of such a distro :)
