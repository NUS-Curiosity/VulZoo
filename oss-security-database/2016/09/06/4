Subject: CVE Request Qemu: scsi: mptsas: invalid memory access while building

   Hello,

Quick emulator(Qemu) built with the LSI SAS1068 Host Bus emulation support, is 
vulnerable to an invalid memory access issue. It could occur while building 
configuration page headers in 'mptsas_config_manufacturing_1'.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
on the host, resulting in DoS.
