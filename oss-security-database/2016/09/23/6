Subject: CVE request Qemu: hw: net: Fix a heap overflow in
 xlnx.xps-ethernetlite

The .receive callback of xlnx.xps-ethernetlite doesn't check the length

of data before calling memcpy. As a result, the NetClientState object in
heap will be overflowed. Attackers may leverage it to execute arbitrary

code with privileges of the qemu process on the host.

But there seems a small problem.
