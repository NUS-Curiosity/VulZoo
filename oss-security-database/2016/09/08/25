Going to this URL, I am asked to login to a Google account (which I
didn't).  Can you please post the contents of your report and Tavis'
reply (as well as any other relevant replies) as a reply to this same
thread here on oss-security?

If your entire message including the 4/3 MIME overhead would be below
200 KB, then please just attach this archive to the message.  Otherwise
please come up with a smaller testcase (and attach it) or use an
external URL for the file (but accessible to everyone without having to
log in).  The former is strongly preferred.

Thanks,

Alexander
