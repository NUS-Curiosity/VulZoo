The problem was due to the definition of strlcpy() in that it is 
supposed to return the number of characters which would have been 
copied if the destination buffer was large enough.  To satisfy this 
requirement, strlcpy() needs to continue scanning memory until it 
encounters a null byte in memory.

The strlcpy() function has very nice properties but this weakness is 
something that developers need to be aware of.
