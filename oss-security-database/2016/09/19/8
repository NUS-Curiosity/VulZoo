Subject: CVE Request Qemu: usb: xhci memory leakage during device unplug

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the USB xHCI controller emulation support is 
vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while doing a USB device 
unplug operation; Doing so repeatedly would result in leaking host memory, 
affecting other services on the host.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to cause a DoS on the host 
and/or potentially crash the Qemu process instance on the host.

Upstream patch:

This issue was reported by Mr Li Qiang of 360.cn Inc.

Thank you.
