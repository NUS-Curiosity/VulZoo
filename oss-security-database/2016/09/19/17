This is on my back burner.  I might approach experimenting with this
some months later.  I'm afraid I have other priorities right now.  For
now, I recommend that you don't use DMARC for addresses that you use on
mailing lists (posting and/or subscribing); in fact, I am likely to
continue to recommend this even if we do deploy a workaround for the
lists hosted at Openwall.
