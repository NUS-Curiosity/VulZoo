Sorry about that, I thought I’d cc’d you with the right address.

Yes, the message was more to let people know that CVE-2016-0634  had been assigned for this issue.   Do you have a link to the Ubuntu issue and a different CVE number?

Yes, that’s correct.   A while ago there was a problem that dhcp would let a malicious dhcp server use a hostname of the attackers choosing.   That was bad not least because would expand whatever was given.   The linux sethostname(2) system call doesn’t make any restrictions on what you can use for a system call so any agent (not just that old dhcp version) that sets the hostname could potentially trigger this.   The bar is obviously set quite high for this: you need to find an agent that you can persuade to set the hostname for you — any agent that just blindly sets the hostname to $(do something bad) is broken, but bash shouldn’t make the situation worse by giving you complete control over the machine.
