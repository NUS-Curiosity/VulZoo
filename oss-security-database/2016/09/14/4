That's true, but I never did in the past, as this mailing list is (or was?)
monitored by mitre, so posting here has been sufficient until now. 

Furthermore in this case I was not quite certain that a CVE was actually
required for this, so I was kind of hoping for guidance.

I was not aware of that, thanks for the heads up. Will follow these
guidelines and use the form in the future. 

Cheers
