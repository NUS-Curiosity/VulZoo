So join the DWF and help us get the OpenSource CVEs out quicker.

Also solved in DWF land (
https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Database), I explicitly
setup the DWF up to handle this, the database explicitly supports a
"REPLACED_BY" state for a CVE:

REPLACED_BY

A list of one or more CVE's that have replaced this entry and what the
relationship is (e.g. a CVE split may break a single existing CVE into
multiple CVEs). The format is RELATION:CVE, if there are multiple entries
they are comma separated (the entire field is quoted). Valid relationships
are currently:

DUPLICATE_OF
SPLIT_TO
SPLIT_FROM
MERGED_TO
MERGED_FROM
REJECT

This field is only used if the CVE is split/merged/found to be a duplicate
or rejected.

So if we need to clean things up later, we can easily.

This is the Open Source Security List. The DWF mandate is all Open Source.
So once the DWF is up and running the Venn diagram of oss-security and DWF
is basically a single circle =).
