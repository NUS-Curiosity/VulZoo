Ideally people should get CVEs and then post to oss-security with the
information and the CVE. A lot of people consume the list data and the
current method means that people end up searching their DBs, making sure
it's new, then entering it, then updating it with a CVE. If people got CVEs
first this would vastly simplify things.
