Subject: Re: Libarchive/bsdtar: multiple crashes

I dug into
https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2016/09/11/libarchive-bsdtar-memory-corruptionunknown-crash-in-bid_entry-archive_read_support_format_mtree-c/,
which I had reported here earlier (thanks for the mention):
https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/issues/747

After digging into the bug, it seemed it wasn't exploitable, and could only
lead to a crash, so I decided to not send it out to the list and request a
CVE.
