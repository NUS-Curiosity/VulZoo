Introduced by:

= Setup =

Create /dev/shm/will-be-emptied/important.txt which will act as an
important file that we wouldn't want to lose.

$ mkdir -p /dev/shm/will-be-emptied/
$ echo data > /dev/shm/will-be-emptied/important.txt

= Test =

1. Open the attached links.tar with File Roller

  $ file-roller links.tar

2. Double-click either of the "absolute" or "relative" files

3. Close the opened Nautilus window as well as the File Roller window

4. Check to see if /dev/shm/will-be-emptied/important.txt has been
unintentionally deleted
