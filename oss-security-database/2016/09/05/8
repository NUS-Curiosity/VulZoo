Subject: Re: CVE ID request: certificate spoofing through crafted SASL message in inspircd, charybdis

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

> inspircd published 2.0.23 that fixes an issue with SASL

> 
> http://www.inspircd.org/2016/09/03/v2023-released.html
> 
> All versions are affected.

>> This release fixes a serious security vulnerability in m_sasl in

>> 
>> This vulnerability allows any attacker to spoof certificate

>> user to login as any other user that they know the certificate
>> fingerprint of, and that user has services configured to accept SASL
>> EXTERNAL login requests for.

>> https://www.irc.wiki/InspIRCd

>> InspIRCd is an IRC daemon written entirely from scratch, it is one

Use CVE-2016-7142 for this issue only in the InspIRCd codebase.


>> This bug appears more widespread than just InspIRCd, and seems to

>> Charybdis and UnrealIRCd.

Use CVE-2016-7143 for this issue only in the Charybdis codebase.

Use CVE-2016-7144 for this issue only in the UnrealIRCd codebase.

(We realize that the file is m_sasl.c, the function is m_authenticate,
and the array is parv in both the Charybdis case and the UnrealIRCd
case, but we decided not to try to share a CVE ID between these two
products.)
