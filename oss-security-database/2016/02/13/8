Sadly the bugzilla implementation, or rather the perl module they are
using for it, is flawed and encrypts to the first public key it
considers viable [0,1] irrespective of usage flags [2], resulting in
un-decryptable emails unless modifying the OpenPGP certificate
presented to secureEmail. I'd really like to see this fixed, but I'm
not sure if the scope is proper for a project such as GSoC. I actually
just wrote up a slight summary of such a project on [3]
