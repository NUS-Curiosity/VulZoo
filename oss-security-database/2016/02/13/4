We generally avoid sitting on vulnerabilities for extended periods.

I doubt many open-source communities would turn away contributors
based on their employment or nationality.  I would find that extremely
discriminatory.  If people are willing to help, you welcome them, and
eventually, this can lead to sharing sensitive security information
with them.
