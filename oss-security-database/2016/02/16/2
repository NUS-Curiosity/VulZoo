Subject: CVE request Qemu: usb: multiple eof_timers in ohci leads to null
 pointer dereference

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the USB OHCI emulation support is vulnerable to a 
null pointer dereference issue. It could occur when OHCI transitions to a 
OHCI_USB_OPERATIONAL state, leading to creation of multiple eof timers. A 
privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on 
the host, resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2016-02/msg03374.html

Reference:
----------
   -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1304794

This issue was discovered by Zuozhi Fzz of Alibaba Inc.

Thank you.
