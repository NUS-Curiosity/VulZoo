Subject: Re: CVE request: reads out-of-bounds with cpio 2.11

We think this may be similar to the
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/11/17/4 and
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/11/03/11 cases in
which the product isn't a library, and typically doesn't need to
remain running after bad input is encountered.

More specifically, we don't know of cases where the relevant cpio
source code (e.g., copyin.c) has been adapted for use in a library for
a long-running process in a different product that also operates on
untrusted input, although this might be plausible because a variety of
products may want cpio support.

A CVE ID may be available if the upstream response indicates that the
out-of-bounds reads allow the attacker to change the flow of control.
