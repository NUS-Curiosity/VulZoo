Subject: CVE Request: cacti: Authentication using web authentication as a user
 not in the,cacti database allows complete access

Could a CVE ID please assigned for the following issue:

http://svn.cacti.net/viewvc/cacti/tags/0.8.8g/docs/CHANGELOG?revision=7788&view=markup
-bug:0002656: Authentication using web authentication as a user not in the
cacti database allows complete access
http://bugs.cacti.net/view.php?id=2656 Classified by upstream as a security fix.
Upstream fix is http://svn.cacti.net/viewvc?view=rev&revision=7770
https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=965930

Accessing cacti using a user name not the cacti database fills the log with
database error messages and allows complete access to everything, including the
user administration pages. The bug is in auth_login.php which fails to check
the query actually found any data or not.

Fixed in tagged but (as of writing) unreleased 0.8.8g.

Thanks,
Andreas
