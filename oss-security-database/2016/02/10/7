Subject: CVE Request : Use-after-free in accel-ppp

Hi,

A use-after-free in accel-ppp was reported one month ago. accel-ppp is a
VPN server (https://accel-ppp.org)
Since I got no news from the dev (neither by email or through the
forum), I would suggest to use this service carefully.

More details about the vuln here :

The vuln was found with the help of the analyzer GUEB.

Best regards,
Josselin Feist
