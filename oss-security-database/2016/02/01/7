Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Django releases issued: 1.9.2 (security) and 1.8.9
 (bugfix)

Today the Django team issued 1.9.2 as part of our security process. This 
releases address a security issue, and we encourage all users to upgrade as 
soon as possible.

The Django 1.8.9 release fixes several bugs in 1.8.8 but no security issues 
as the issue fixed in 1.9.2 doesn't affect older versions.

Details are available on the Django project weblog:

https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2016/feb/01/releases-192-and-189/

As a reminder, we ask that potential security issues be reported via 
private email to security@...ngoproject.com and not via Django's Trac 
instance or the django-developers list. Please see 
https://www.djangoproject.com/security for further information.
