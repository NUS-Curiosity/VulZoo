Subject: HTTPS Only (Open Source, Python)

This tool completely locks browser:
just HTTPS, nothing else.

This tool is extremely simple:
less than 100 lines of code(Python and JavaScript).

If browser tries to access HTTP address,
you will have three options:
try HTTPS,
Google Cache,
or copy-and-paste the address.

There is no option to "temporarily bypass HTTPS Only".
You can always do that in another browser.
