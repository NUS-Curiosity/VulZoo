To be correct, it's not really a patch, but rather a configure option.

Note that in the meantime we have developed an alternative workaround
on the glibc side, which allows to not break systems with multiple
/dev/pts mounts, though the result is not POSIX compliant:

  https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commit;h=77356912e83601fd0240d22fe4d960348b82b5c3

This commit is included in glibc 2.23, and on the Debian side we have
backported it to glibc 2.21 and to 2.22, and pushed the result to the
users. We have also backported it to 2.19 (Debian jessie), but not
pushed it to users yet (it is in progress).
