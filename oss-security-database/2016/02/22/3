Subject: CVE request Qemu: usb: integer overflow in remote NDIS control
 message handling

   Hello,

Qemu emulator built with the USB Net device emulation support is vulnerable to 
an integer overflow issue. It could occur while processing remote NDIS control 
message packets. As the incoming informationBufferOffset & Length combination 
could cross the integer range.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to leak host memory bytes 
to guest or crash the Qemu process instance resulting in DoS.
