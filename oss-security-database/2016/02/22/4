Subject: imagemagick: request for CVEs

Hello,

Debian has been tracking a number of security issues in imagemagick, and
as a Debian-LTS maintainer I have been advised to try to obtain CVEs for
these issue. On investigation some of these issues have already had CVE
requests however as far as I can tell, CVEs were not assigned (apologies
if I missed something), and I am not sure why.

As there are no CVEs allocated, I have used the temp ids given by Debian
for now.
