Regular Expression Denial of Service

January 19th, 2016

CVE-PENDING â€¢ Credit: Adam Baldwin

Specifically crafted long headers or uris can cause a minor denial of
service when using hawk versions less than 4.1.1.

"The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service
attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations
may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly
(exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program
using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang
for a very long time."

Does Mitre know about this? Can we please have a CVE assigned for this?
Thanks.
