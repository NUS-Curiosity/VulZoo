Hi Reed,

To be honest, I'm not quite sure, and never thought about it... I did
not author this code, which has been like this since before I even
joined the project [1]. The implementation of Gravatar as a plugin just
recycled the existing code.

IMO your suggestion to always use https makes sense, I'm cc'ing the
MantisBT dev list as this is probably better discussed there. You're
also welcome to open an issue in our tracker if you want.

Cheers
Damien
