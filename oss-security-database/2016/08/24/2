CVE-2016-6319: Foreman stored XSS in form label helpers

The "label" parameter of all form helpers used to construct web UI
components was not escaped allowing XSS (cross-site scripting). The
Foreman itself did not contain exploitable code but other plugins that
relied on these form helpers could be vulnerable. One known vulnerable
plugin is Remote Execution. All versions of this plugin are affected.

Affects Foreman 1.6.0 and higher
Fix released in Foreman 1.12.2

Patch:
https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/commit/0f35fe14acf0d0d3b55e9337bc5e2b9640ff2372
