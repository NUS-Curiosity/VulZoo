Thanks.  This appears to have made no effect, and thus didn't work
around whatever ezmlm-idx bug(?) your messages are triggering here.
Your messages are missing the Content-Type header for MIME parts that
are not empty, so this does not literally fit the description above.

Anyway, it's not a topic for oss-security.  I am merely noting that this
is something I need to investigate and fix... eventually.
