I think everyone in the software space assumes that all DNS registries
block registrations which would allocate names colliding under the
IDNA 2003 and 2008 standards to different owners.  There were even
attempts at the registry level to automatically alias different
encodings (something which is difficult because it interferes with the
goal to make the whole thing application-centric).

What does DENIC say about this matter?  It looks like their
implementation of IDNA is just very broken.
