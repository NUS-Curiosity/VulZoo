Subject: kernel: fix minor infoleak in get_user_ex()

Hi guys,

I suppose this bug should get a CVE number.

Info:
get_user_ex(x, ptr) should zero x on failure. It's not a lot of a leak
(at most we are leaking uninitialized 64bit value off the kernel
stack, and in a fairly constrained situation, at that), but the fix is
trivial, so... Cc: stable@...r.kernel.org Signed-off-by: Al Viro

uaccess fixes since mid-August ] Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds

Impact:
