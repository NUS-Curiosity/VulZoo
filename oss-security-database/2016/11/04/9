It is possible (and also allowed by the DENIC), that e.g. "straße.de" and
"strasse.de" have two different domain owners. I performed at least one
registration for a customer for a "ß"-domain after the "ß" sunrise period
was over, where the "ß"-domain owner is not the owner of the corresponding
"ss"-domain. Not sure which rules you refer to, but except the "ß"-sunrise
period in 2010, I'm able to register "ß"-domains on first come, first serve
basis at DENIC.

The DENIC FAQ (https://www.denic.de/en/faqs/faqs-about-idns-ss/) mentions
also that e.g. "mueller.de" and "müller.de" are two completely different
domain names (even "ue" is the German transcription of "ü") - and here the
argumentation is, that "bauer.de" is not the same like "baür.de" (which is
from the non-technical perspective of a German native speaker obviously
true). From my understanding, the argumentation here is non-IDNA mueller.de
vs. IDNA2003 müller.de, while now it is IDNA2003 strasse.de vs. IDNA2008
straße.de - which might be slightly different, because it's a switch of the
IDNA version rather the introduction.

For those who didn't notice, Florian also started a German thread on the
public DENIC mailing list (https://www.denic.de/en/service/mailing-lists/)
about exactly this topic (I'm not sure if there is a public archive).
