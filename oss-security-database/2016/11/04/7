I poked a bit.
Nothing spectacular, a stac underread (accesses -1 of array), but only
in the command line tool:
https://gitlab.com/jas/libidn2/commit/3e3742321e7a280874903a7f7ae9bae7852c3415

And a memleak (not committed yet, sent to the maintianer).

It's only one function, so it's not too much to test.
