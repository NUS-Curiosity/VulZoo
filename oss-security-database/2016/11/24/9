Subject: CVE request: icu: stack-based buffer overflow in uloc_getDisplayName


A stack overflow in ICU4C (http://icu-project.org/), fixed some 3 years
ago in 54.1 but affecting versions back to (at least) 3.6, has just been
made public on the ICU tracker.

Upstream bug:

http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/10891

Patch:

http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/changeset/35699

The bug was originally discovered in PHP and a workaround applied there:

https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=67397

Note that the PHP bug is exactly the same flaw, but they worked around
it by limiting the length of strings passed to icu.  I don't believe
this needs a separate CVE even though it was "fixed" independently.

While code execution is theoretically possible, bypassing the stack
canary looks extremely difficult.  Most likely impact on platforms
building with SSP is only a crash.
