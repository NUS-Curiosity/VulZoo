Subject: Libtiff 4.0.7 release fixes many security issues

It is perhaps not broadly known that libtiff 4.0.7 was released on 
November 20th, and it addresses a great many security issues.

The release notes may be read at 
"http://www.simplesystems.org/libtiff/v4.0.7.html".

The release notes are based on information which was available when 
the bug was reported or the commit made.  If there was a CVE number, 
it was made note of.  If there was a vendor issue number, that was 
made note of.  Many issues may have had CVEs assigned later and (due 
to lack of resources and incomplete information) we did not attempt to 
investigate and back-annotate the change logs with CVE numbers.
