Subject: CVE Request: Linux: net/sctp: slab-out-of-bounds in sctp_sf_ootb

Hi,

There's a bug in the Linux kernel sctp implementation which allows a
remote attacker to trigger a slab-out-of-bounds access with an offset
up to 64K bytes.

The bug was fixed upstream:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/bf911e985d6bbaa328c20c3e05f4eb03de11fdd6

More details are here:

Could you assign a CVE for this?

Thanks!
