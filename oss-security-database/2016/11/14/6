MySQL-based databases including MySQL, MariaDB and PerconaDB are affected
by a privilege escalation vulnerability which can let attackers who have
gained access to mysql system user (for example through CVE-2016-6663)
to further escalate their privileges to root user allowing them to
fully compromise the system.
The vulnerability stems from unsafe file handling of error logs and other files.

Affected versions:

MySQL
<= 5.5.51
<= 5.6.32
<= 5.7.14

MariaDB
All current

Percona Server
< 5.5.51-38.2
< 5.6.32-78-1
