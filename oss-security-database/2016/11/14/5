Subject: MySQL / MariaDB / Percona - Privilege Escalation / Race Condition
 Exploit [CVE-2016-6663 / CVE-2016-5616]

Vulnerability: MySQL / MariaDB / Percona - Privilege Escalation / Race Condition
CVE-2016-6663 / (Oracle) CVE-2016-5616

Discovered by:

Affected versions:

MariaDB
< 5.5.52
< 10.1.18
< 10.0.28

MySQL
<= 5.5.51
<= 5.6.32
<= 5.7.14

Percona Server
< 5.5.51-38.2
< 5.6.32-78-1
< 5.7.14-8

Percona XtraDB Cluster
< 5.6.32-25.17
< 5.7.14-26.17
< 5.5.41-37.0


An independent research has revealed a race condition vulnerability which
affects MySQl, MariaDB and PerconaDB databases.
The vulnerability can allow a local system user with access to the affected
database in the context of a low-privileged account
(CREATE/INSERT/SELECT grants)
to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code as the database system
user (typically 'mysql').
Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to gain full read/write access
to all of the files (including configuration files) and databases belonging
to the affected database server.
The obtained level of access upon the exploitation, could be chained with
the other privilege escalation vulnerabilities discovered by the author of
this advisory (CVE-2016-6662 and CVE-2016-6664) to further escalate privileges
from mysql user to root user and thus allow attackers to fully compromise the
target server.

A copy of the full advisory is also attached to this message as per
the oss-sec guidelines (for those who still use dial-up I guess... :)
