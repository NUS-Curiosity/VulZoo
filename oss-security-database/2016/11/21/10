Subject: Re: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities affecting five
 WordPress Plugins

One aspect of this is the quality of CVE requests. Well formed requests are
easy and fast to process. Poorly formed requests take more time (I'm not
speaking about these WordPress issues in specific, but more in general
terms).

We (MITRE and the CVE board as well as efforts like the DWF) are also
making significant changes to CVE, how they are assigned, CNAs, federation,
the technology and more that should result in much easier and faster
assignments.

Also there are problems with OVE, for example what counting rules does it
use? Where is the database of data? To be honest OVE is a nice idea, but
falls very short of what people need from a vulnerability identifier.
