	relevant?

Hello guys,

  the fix as mentioned at:

http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=6b6707a50c7598a83820077393f8823ab791abf8;hp=2e761e0532a784816e7e822dbaaece8c5d4be14d


is reasonable. Have investigated this issue in a little deep
detail. Seems it could be a problem in case when the targeted
host would run / have created the L2TP tunnel, would support
the Point to Point protocol with the L2TP plugin enabled
and then local, unprivileged user could potentially
issue an PPP command / request with too long L2TP packet
to force kernel heap corruption (DoS). But as there 
is no testcase / exploit available till now I am aware
of, this all is only a presumption. If this would
be a real problem, than hopefully only with low severity
(due the special conditions / requirements that need
to be satisfied to trigger this issue).

Kind regards
