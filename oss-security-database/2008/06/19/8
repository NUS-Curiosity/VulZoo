At this stage, I believe that a CVE identifier is important.  Here, it
serves two roles:

1) being absolutely sure we know which Firefox 3.0 issue is being
discussed - which can be done if a CVE description is anchored on a
particular reference or source.

2) Tracking, then eventually resolving, confusion between multiple
disclosures.  Granted we don't always succeed at this, but it's a goal.

So, I've assigned CVE-2008-2785 for the unspecified issue being claimed by
Tipping Point.

But, I've also assigned a separate CVE-2008-2786 for a Full-Disclosure
post talking about a buffer overflow.  Typically I try to avoid creating
CVEs for these - anyone could claim "I found BUG-TYPE X in product Z" and
there's no way of proving things - but here, there's likely some confusion
about whether the FD post is the same as ZDI's or not.  And ZDI is
specifically not saying anything about that.
