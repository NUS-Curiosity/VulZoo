I don't think there's a need to setup such a project "formally", under
its own name or whatever, before it is started.  Instead, if there are
people to work on this, they are more than welcome to use this mailing
list and the oss-security wiki for it (we even have a wiki namespace
pre-created).  If we ever get to the point where this needs to be
separated, that won't be hard to do.
