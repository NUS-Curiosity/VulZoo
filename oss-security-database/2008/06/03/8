FWIW, I tend to agree too. Many of us are already subscribed to
full-disclosure/bugtraq because we send our advisories there, so it
seems a bit pointless.

That's unfortunate, hopefully it won't happen here if we keep moderating
it, but I agree with what's said below, we should think about a proper
policy to detail what's allowed (and encouraged) on the list, and what's
not.

Looking at the archives, at least half of the topics are CVE requests,
so maybe we should think about renaming the list "oss-CVEreq" :)
But personally, I find it very useful, it's also a handy way to keep an
eye on possible issues before they're on secunia, e.g when a user
reports a bug on a distro's BTS instead of reporting directly
to the upstream project.

That's a wise decision, at least now we know what content we're going
to receive.

As said before, I totally agree here.
