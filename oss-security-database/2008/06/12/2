Subject: CVE id request: menalto gallery

http://gallery.menalto.com/gallery_2.2.5_released

cite:

Gallery 2.2.5 addresses the following security vulnerabilities:

    * XSS through host and path component of request URL - The complete 
request URL is now properly sanitized (applying the same input filtering as 
for all other inputs). This severe vulnerability affects all modules.
    * Information disclosure in album-select module - Fixed exposure of album 
titles through the album-select module when a guest would add a new album to 
a hidden album.
    * Permission escalation through zip archive extraction - No longer 
creating sub-albums when adding items from a zip archive if the active user 
does not have the necessary permission to do so.
    * Information disclosure through embed.php - embed.php is no longer 
susceptible to spoofing the remote address and thus no longer discloses the 
local filesystem path of the Gallery 2 installation folder.
    * View permissions not enforced for password protected items - No longer 
offering the option to protect non-album items directly and only offering the 
feature for albums since full protection only applies to the items within the 
album.
