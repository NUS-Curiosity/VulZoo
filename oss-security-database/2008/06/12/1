Subject: CVE id request: TYPO3-20080611-1: Multiple vulnerabilities in 
     TYPO3 Core

Hi,

Does anyone already have a CVE id, or could I get one (probably two)
assigned for, the following TYPO3 security announcement:

http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-20080611-1/

Vulnerability #1: Default value of fileDenyPattern allows arbitrary code
execution on Apache
Vulnerability #2: fe_adminlib.inc allows Cross Site Scripting


cheers,
Thijs
