Subject: CVE id request: checkinstall

Hi

Checkinstall (and installwatch) create temporary directories manually
instead of using mktemp, which creates a race condition.

patch:
http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/secure-testing-team/2008-June/001672.html

Could I please get a CVE id for this issue?

Cheers
Steffen
