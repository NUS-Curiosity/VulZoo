I don't really mind about announces either, only about 
quadrupled ones because of cross-posting :)

At least for Debian there is an audit project 
(http://www.debian.org/security/audit/) which is not really 
active anymore though. As far as I know Gentoo has a similar 
project. What about replacing those by an oss-security-audit 
project? I don't think oCert is the solution to audit 
requests as it simply lacks of enough manpower to do that in 
an organized fashion.
But having some kind of general list for this hosted in a 
distribution neutral environment might work out.

I do! ;)
