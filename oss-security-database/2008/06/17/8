I said that its a bug rather than a security flaw. However you can
assign it a CVE id if you want to.
We didn't treat it as security, because it occurs in a non-default
config (MailFollowURLs), it is not externally controllable, and it
occurs rarely (so far we got 2 reports of this bug).

I recommend to use 0.93.1, however if you want to backport parts of
it, these are the most important (from the ChangeLog).
The daily.cfg and dconf changes are important for turning off
vulnerable modules, the rest is self explanatory.
