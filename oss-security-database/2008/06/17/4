Hello,

Here is another upstream log, I suspect that this is a security fix too.

  * libclamav/mbox.c, shared/network.c: prevent uninitialized use of hostent
  structure (bb #1003).

The bug entry says that after zip file's arriving at clamd, it suddenly dies 
and nothing can be retrieved thereafter. Clamav developer also comfirms that 
this happens when MailFollowURLs is enabled.

Could someone take a look at this issue?
