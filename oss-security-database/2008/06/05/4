The problem you demonstrated above was caused by (2), running a python 
script that is located in /tmp. Portage, and most other python 
programs, are not installed in /tmp, and therefore they do not import 
files from /tmp, even if they are actually called there:

rbu@...nut /tmp $ touch re.so
rbu@...nut /tmp $ cat /home/rbu/foo.py
import string
print "foo"

import sys
print sys.path
rbu@...nut /tmp $ python /home/rbu/foo.py
foo
['/home/rbu', '/usr/lib64/portage/pym', '/usr/lib64/python25.zip', '/usr/lib64/python2.5', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/plat-linux2', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/lib-tk', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/lib-dynload', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/Numeric', '/usr/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/gtk-2.0']
