Subject: Two remote DoS issues in linuxdcpp

Hey,

Linux DC++ (linuxdcpp) is a Direct Connect client based on the same 
client code as DC++, so it is vulnerable to the recently reported

[1] NULL pointer dereference remote DoS via partial file list requests
http://secunia.com/advisories/30812/
http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=608612&group_id=40287
https://bugs.launchpad.net/dcplusplus/+bug/238333 [Can't view]

Patch for linuxdcpp:
http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/linuxdcpp/linuxdcpp/client/ShareManager.cpp.diff?r1=1.14&r2=1.15&sortby=date

[2] Empty message Remote DoS
When an attacker sends an empty message, he can cause the client to 
abort with "std::out_of_range" in substr().

Patch for linuxdcpp:
