Subject: CVE id request: Clamav

Hi

The upstream changelog says:
* libclamav/petite.c: fix possible invalid memory access (bb#1000)
				Reported by Damian Put

This seems to read beyond the end of an array and could potentially lead to a 
DoS.

Upstream bugreport:
https://wwws.clamav.net/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1000


Could I get a CVE id for this?

Cheers
Steffen
