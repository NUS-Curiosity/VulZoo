Subject: CVE id request: perl

Hi

rmtree() when used with symlinks changes permissions of the link target to the
link, which allows symlinks attacks.

Upstream Bug:
http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=36982

Debian Bug (with proposed patch):
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=487319


Could I please have a CVE id for this?

Cheers
Steffen
