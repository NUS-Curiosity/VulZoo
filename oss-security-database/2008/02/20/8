Sounds good to me.  Maybe having the thing unfettered for a time and see
how it works would be best.  If problems do come up, we can always fall
back to the subscriber-moderation and/or message moderation (although,
to be honest, I'm more in favour of subscriber-moderation than message
moderation unless spam starts to become a real problem).
