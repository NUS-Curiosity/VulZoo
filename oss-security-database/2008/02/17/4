We can probably disregard the whole kick out bits.  That really would only
apply to a private list that deals with sensitive information.  I don't
think there is a benefit to creating a private list at this time, as
vendor-sec exists and is functional.

No, there isn't a benefit in this instance.  I do think that encouraging
everyone to contribute in some meaningful manner is a good goal.  Anytime
you have a list full of smart people, the new people are usually quite
intimidated and afraid to engage.  We need to be mindful of this.

Yes.  I have some notes on this as well.  I've been pondering how best to
present this data for quite some time, and have unsuccessfully peddled a
presentation to several conferences..  I'll have to dig out my old notes
(which really means find them in the file ghetto that is my ~).

Thanks for the feedback.
