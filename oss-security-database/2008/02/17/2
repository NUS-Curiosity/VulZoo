Thank you for posting this!

I have some comments, see below:

OK, so oss-security (this list) is going to be the public (and much
larger) part of the group, and there's going to be some overlap between
the parts.  It is interesting to note that the small-and-trusted part
of the group is not going to be a subset of the large-and-public part:
although this list was announced on vendor-sec, not all vendor-sec
members have decided to join.  My understanding is that this is largely
because many vendor-sec members are there "just" to be able to update
their distributions in time for coordinated public disclosure dates -
which is fine because it benefits the end-users.

This sounds good, except that I see no need to "kick out unresponsive
members".  If they like to listen to our conversations in real time
(rather than browse the archives) and maybe learn from them - this can
only be good.  Of course, active contribution would be even better.
So is this "kick out policy" an attempt to encourage contribution?..

Or were you speaking of a vendor-sec equivalent - not this list, but
perhaps yet another list to be created for the small-and-trusted part of
the group?  If so, how would that differ from vendor-sec itself?   Would
it differ in that any (trusted?) Open Source projects would be accepted,
not just distribution "vendors"?

The same comments apply here.

Yes, we would like to see a lot of active members, but do we really need
to kick out the sponges, would that be of benefit?

Right - all of this should go on the wiki, and any discussions may occur
in here.

Sounds great.  This should be worth a try.

Thanks again,
