Moreover, I can make some tweaks and such a page could be automatically
referenced from other pages.  For instance, if we maintain a page with
common abbreviations then any other page which mention a defined
abbreviation would have an on-hover event with a description of the
abbreviation.  Just an idea.

I can install the auto-index plugin that does this.  Currently, we are running
a bare installation of DokuWiki with the minimal set of plugins.

One more topic to discuss is where all these Wiki enhancements should be
discussed.  I feel that oss-security is the wrong place since this
mailing list's goal is to discuss security and not the Wiki itself.
Perhaps, all Wiki-related discussions should go to to a namespace that
is describing the Wiki itself, and once some functionality is discussed
there - a short request for approval/disapproval should be posted here.
My concern is that if we move the whole Wiki-enhancement topic off this
list we might lose a connection between people on this list (who are
populating the Wiki) and a team who is maintaining the Wiki (currently,
it's me and Solar).
