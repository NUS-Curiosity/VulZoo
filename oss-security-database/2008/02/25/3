I like this idea.  It definitely would be nice to know if the effort in
setting up cvs or svn or whatever would be worthwhile; i.e. if enough
people would use it to make it worth the possible effort/complexity to
maintain it.

To start off, I think the wiki would work quite well.  It probably
wouldn't scale well if it got wildly popular, but if there are only a
few people doing it, then maybe the wiki is all we need.
