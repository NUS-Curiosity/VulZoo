I think you're getting a little too technical here. While in theory we
could have a separate list for infrastructure discussions, it's probably
too premature for that. If in the future, we find it's generating too much
noise, we can do this. For now though, if someone doesn't care about the
wiki, they can just not read those messages. I think discussing issues
pertinent to the oss-security concept as a whole on this list is relevant
and wise. As you say, if we move off-list, we will lose a lot of eyeballs.
