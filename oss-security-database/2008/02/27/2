I'm ok with a vote.  Actually, I would say that most people probably
don't care, so I'd say if you get 3-4 votes *against* something, then
don't implement it.  Most people who don't care one way or the other
will say nothing, while those against something are more likely to speak
up.

Of course, a valid reason as to why they are against something should be
a prerequisite.
