Subject: subscription-request procedure?

Thanks for setting up this list.
It sounds like what I've been looking for.

I've skimmed the archives and looked through the wiki,
but didn't find a subscription-request procedure, so maybe
this will do.

I tend the upstream GNU coreutils and am co-maintainer of gnulib
automake, autoconf, and a few others.
