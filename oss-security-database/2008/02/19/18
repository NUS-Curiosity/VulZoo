Feel free to do it.  We can always change this policy (and edit the wiki
page accordingly) if needed.

In fact, I think even something as simple as compulsory introduction
will turn some people away - e.g., those Open Source authors who are new
to security and would like to listen to our conversations before they
might dare to introduce themselves.

Maybe we don't really require it?  Maybe we don't really need to make
this list subscription-moderated?  This implies that we'll have to
enable message moderation (with its associated delays) even for list
members at some point, though.

To avoid the delays, we might enhance (patch) ezmlm-idx to honor its
"allow" list even for fully-message-moderated lists.  This is probably
not too hard to do, although I have not looked into it.  Normally, the
"allow" list appears to only be honored for lists that are
message-moderated for non-members.
