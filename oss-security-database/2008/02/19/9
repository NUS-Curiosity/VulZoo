Nope, I don't mind.  That was before I was looking at the docuwiki
syntax, I'm sure.

That's a good idea.  I don't know if docuwiki supports moderated
membership, but if it does, we should keep that in mind and possibly
enable that in the future to prevent things like spambots or others to
hijack pages.

I believe he's joined, although I didn't see a page about vendor-sec
yet.

I've mentioned it on my personal blog and will probably send a notice to
the Mandriva security-discuss mailing list to let our users know about
it as well.

That's good to hear (I didn't think anyone would be against and it
neutral is ok).
