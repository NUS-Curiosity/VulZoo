I agree.  That should probably be added on the charter page that a
simple introductory email requesting subscription should suffice (i.e.
indicate who you are and what you're involved with).

Since folks like Jim are exactly the type of people we want on the list,
we need to make the process fairly simple (and fast, if possible) to
prevent turning people off.
