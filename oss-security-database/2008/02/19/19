Yes, these are very good points.  I think the best solution at the moment
would be to let anyone who is subscribed to post, and let anyone subscribe.
If we have problems, we can tighten things up a bit later.

This is one of the tricking things when starting something up such as this.
It's easy to solve problems that don't exist, which then end up turning
people away.

FWIW, mailman has the ability to enable individual user moderation.
Something similar would certainly be a useful feature here.
