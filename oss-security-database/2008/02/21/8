I think that it's good to preserve original timestamps of patches
extracted from SRPMs (at least this is what our, Openwall's, conventions
require and what we do when borrowing patches from other distros):

rpm2cpio fn.rpm | cpio --make-directories --extract --preserve-modification-time

Just my $0.02.
