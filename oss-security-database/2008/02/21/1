I'd really like to have at least a "how to find a patch for [distro],
release [version]".  I have an easier time finding Debian patches,
for example, since http://snapshot.debian.net/ exists.  Ubuntu is a
bit less patch-hunter-friendly in that regard, but we try to alway keep
patches external to from the source tree, so they're easy to locate from
change logs.  Doing this with src.rpms follows a similar convention,
but can sometimes get tricky too.  Finding them can sometimes be a chore
-- I always bang my head when looking for RHEL src.rpms.  :)
