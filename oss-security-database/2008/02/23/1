IIRC, Steve's reason for not being on vendor-sec was that he did not
want to be exposed to more non-public security issues (and detailed info
on them) than is necessary for assigning CVE ids.  If so, this reason
does not apply for oss-security, because this is a public list.  Steve -
you're welcome to join us on oss-security, although this is, of course,
up to you. :-)

Thanks,
