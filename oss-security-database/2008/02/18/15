Not yet.

I was thinking that we should get started first, with the list and the
wiki wide open like they are now, then decide on how we want to tighten
things up and do it, and only after that try to gain greater exposure.

Yes, I am sorry about that.  This is my "blists" software that got stuck
in an early development stage (no time), with many desirable features
yet to be implemented.  It works off indexed mbox files, in case you're
curious - just two files per mailing list (the mbox and its index).

This list should definitely be submitted to Gmane and MARC, maybe to
some others as well.  I am just not sure whether it's time to do that.

I think I am the one to do it since I will need to provide the mbox
with past messages - and I am willing to do it if/when the most active
list members (including you) request that.  Just have in mind that this
might result in us having to turn on subscription and/or message
moderation and disallow wiki editing by new users a bit earlier.
