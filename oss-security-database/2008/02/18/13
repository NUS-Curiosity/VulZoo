Subject: FAQ for upstream maintainers

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Since my main goal (I understand if your goals differ, but they
certainly should not conflict) for this list is to provide a way for
upstream to coordinate with the vendors, I'm going to start a FAQ or
tutorial or whatever dedicated to what upstream should do when they get
a report from a user about a security issue.

Basic rough draft:
http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/whattodo

I'm sure it can use some cleanup... Ideas, submissions, etc welcome!
Also quite welcome would be someone with wiki-fu prettying up the page :-)
