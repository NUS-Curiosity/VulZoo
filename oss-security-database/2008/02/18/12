I just found another issue: it is possible to "show differences to
current version" without being logged in - and, of course, original
(non-obfuscated) e-mail addresses are seen in these source diffs.

Unless we come up with a way to address that (e.g., somehow disable this
feature for anonymous visitors), I'm afraid that we'll have to obfuscate
addresses manually prior to entering them into the wiki...
