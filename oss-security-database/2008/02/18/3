Subject: code review CVS


Hi,

>From my view it would be helpful to have some forum/CVS or whatever
where code reviewers can submit the code they already audited along
with remarks/exploits/patches etc.
So everyone can match this against the version of the OSS project.
In an ideal case their latest released version equals the
version in the review CVS. It saves also the time to review
files again which didnt change during versions.

Sebastian
