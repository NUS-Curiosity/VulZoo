One nitpick before we get too established... would it be possible to
turn off reply-to-list? That is what "reply to all" is for in mail
clients :-)

I'm not sure if this is possible, but I'd like to see read-only
subscriptions. That is, folks can "subscribe" and get the list via email
without having to be approved to post to the list. See below for more
discussion on this isssue.

My hope is that we can get "upstream" maintainers involved at least to
some extent in this project. That is, when some {f{,l}}oss (I guess for
this list we're going with "oss") project encounters a security issue,
they'll come to either oss-security or vendor-sec and communicate with
the folks who consume their work. I hope this to be true whether or not
they are actually on the list.

So, what we'll really have are three classes of users. One is the folks
who read the list and don't have the ability to post. Joining this group
should require no administrative action, and it should be open to the
public. The second is folks who can post but aren't members. I'd add
upstream authors to this list on a case-by-case basis. The third is
folks who read it and can post, such as (I'd imagine) many current
vendor-sec members. These folks need to be vetted on a case-by-case
basis as well. Can the software currently being used to host the list be
configured for the above?

PS: thanks for calling it "oss-security" and not "oss-sec" ;-)
