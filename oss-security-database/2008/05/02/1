Subject: CVE-2008-0553 / CVE-2006-4484 also affects tkimg

Hi!

It was brought to our attention that tkimg uses / forks tk gif handling
code and is affected by CVE-2008-0553 (as used for tk) / CVE-2006-4484
(as used for gd).

http://tkimg.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/tkimg?view=rev&revision=135

Tk fix:

http://tktoolkit.cvs.sourceforge.net/tktoolkit/tk/generic/tkImgGIF.c?r1=1.40&r2=1.41

tkimg changelog uses CVE-2006-4484 (as it's used in the tk commit
message as well), but CVE-2008-0553 should probably be used here.
