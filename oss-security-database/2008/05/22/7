We've gotten similar requests at Debian, with people requesting it be fixed in 
a security update. Our position until now has been that we're not treating it 
as a security issue: it has been in that IP space for years and there are no 
concrete indications that the owner of that block has turned bad. The same 
could be said for many other IP's of the root servers, where the owner of the 
space, connectivity or housing is currently trusted but could go bad at some 
point. We'll probably fix it in a next point update.

However, if many other vendors are treating it as a security issue, we're 
interested in their reasons and may follow suit to prevent confusion.
