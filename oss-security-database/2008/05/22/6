The party isn't untrusted (they're still involved in operating the B
root).  They're not a third party, either, they're the legitimate owner
of that address block.

ICANN should have arranged for a longer transition period, as it was
done in previous transitions (I think a few older address still respond
to queries).

There's no way to retire an IP address, especially if it is located in a
network prefix that is still in production (which was a driving force
behind most past root servers migrations).
