Subject: CVE id request: ikiwiki

Hi,
Joey Hess discovered that if openid and passwordauth 
plugins are both ennabled in ikiwiki which is the case in 
the default installation anyone can log in using an openid 
that has already been used to login into the wiki and 
doesn't use a password.

This is Debian bug: http://bugs.debian.org/483770

As Steven is currently on semi-vacation, Martin can you 
assign a CVE id for this issue from the Debian pool?

Kind regards
Nico
