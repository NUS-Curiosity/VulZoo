For those of you playing along at home, the Red Hat blog entry about this
is here:
http://www.press.redhat.com/2008/05/27/security-open-source-style/

I added a note on my blog here:
http://www.bress.net/blog/archives/115-Announcing-oss-security.html

That will get picked up by the Fedora blog aggregator, which will help to
spread the word.

Thanks.
