Subject: CVE request: Bugzilla (Unauthorized Bug Change, XSS, Account Impersonation)

Hi,

can we please get CVE ids assigned for the three issues mentioned in the 
release announcement [1] of the new bugzilla versions?

"""
* Users without the "canconfirm" privilege could enter a bug as
   NEW or ASSIGNED by using the XML-RPC interface.

* When viewing several bugs at once, there was a Cross-Site
   Scripting hole.

* The inbound email interface allowed you to set the Reporter via
   the text of the email, instead of just using the From header.
"""

Thanks,
