Thanks for bringing up the topic here.

Gentoo is discussing the feature in bug #221759 [1]. Until now, I have 
not heard a reaction to the patch from our OpenSSH maintainers, so I 
cannot judge on the technical side of the inclusion.

I assume whichever version has the acceptance of the OpenSSH upstream is 
what most of us would be willing to go with. Did you discuss either 
blacklist format with them already?

Personally, I would like to see the feature ported to our distribution 
sooner than later, but neither at the cost of maintaining patchsets for 
the rest of existance, nor with high transition cost once upstream 
accepts another format.
