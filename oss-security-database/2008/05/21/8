Subject: vsftpd CVE-2007-5962 (Red Hat / Fedora specific)

Hi Chris!

This is just a heads-up.  We are releasing updated vsftpd packages
containing a fix for a minor memory leak identified by CVE-2007-5962.

The issue occurred because of the Red Hat / Fedora specific patch
which, according to information from our vsftpd maintainer, is not in
upstream.  I also checked few major vendors, it seems no one is using
the patch.

More details in our BZ:
