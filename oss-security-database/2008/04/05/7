: I'd like to point out that email addresses aren't obfuscated on 
: osvdb.org.  Perhaps this is something to fix?  Meanwhile I updated 
: Openwall info there and provided our security e-mail in the obfuscated 
: form.

I'll talk to our dev. On 1.0, they were obfuscated to prevent harvesting. 
A few months ago we launched 2.0, which was a full re-write in RoR. That 
little feature must have been overlooked. I will open a ticket and 
prioritive it.
