Yes, I think that's best.  No sense in adding a link to a project nobody
really knows about (which is by design).

I'd like to see us work on the wiki content a bit more.  Perhaps a todo
page where we can list new content needed, and point at content that needs
some help.  Is there an easy way we can create an index of content that has
the FIXME wiki tag?

I don't think anyone wants this, but just as never making ourselves known
is bad, a premature announcement isn't much good either.  I think we're
close, but not quite there yet.  We do however need to be mindful of the
old quote "perfect is the enemy of the good".

I think the way to go for this is going to be let the current members post
without moderation, and once there is an announcement, moderate new
members, with the option to remove the moderation flag is they prove to be
helpful.  A semi moderated list is going to be the way to go I suspect.

Thanks.
