I think this is a good definition.

Bottom-line would be that this isn't a list for end-users.  End-users or
sysadmins, whatever, could be read-only subscribers... heck, that's no
different than reading web archives.

But to be a "member" of the list, with posting priveleges, I think you
need to be someone who can demonstrate an active role with some OSS --
this does not mean you need to be on a vendor security team, or the
apache/samba/whatever security contact.  You could be a grunt developer
who has an interest in security-related stuff (perhaps good programming
techniques, etc.) and as long as you're a member or developer of some
OSS with a reasonable exposure, then I think you can have a voice on the
list if you like.

Honestly, I think a lot of people will be lurkers... so for them they
never need to progress beyond read-only subscriber.  It's the people who
are interested in security (be it re-active or pro-active) that will
want to be "members" of the list.

Now, having said that, I think the ml subscription can be a lot more
open than wiki editing rights (which is a whole different ball of wax).
