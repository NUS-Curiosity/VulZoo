I've added links to OSVDB and to the OSVDB vendors database page to:

	http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors
	http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/software
	http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/links

"OSVDB maintains The Vendor Dictionary, an extensive database of
software and appliance vendors (not limited to Open Source ones)."

"http://osvdb.org - OSVDB (The Open Source Vulnerability Database)"

I've also cross-linked our vendors, software, and infrastructure pages.
