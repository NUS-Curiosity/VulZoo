Subject: [oCERT 2008-02] libfishsound insufficient boundary checks


2008/04/06 #2008-02 libfishsound insufficient boundary checks

Description:

The libfishsound decoder library incorrectly implements the reference speex
decoder from the Speex library, performing insufficient boundary checks on a
header structure read from user input.

A user controlled field in the header structure is used to build a function
pointer. The libfishsound implementation does not check for negative values for
the field, allowing the function pointer to be pointed at an arbitary position
in memory. This allows remote code execution.

A patch has been committed to the libfishsound public repository.

Affected version: <= 0.9.0

Fixed version: current svn tree

Additional affected packages:

Illuminable DirectShow Filters for Ogg Vorbis, which statically include the
libfishsound library.
