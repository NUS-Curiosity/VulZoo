Nice find!

My immediate suspicion is that they're not the same, based solely on
affected versions - CVE-2008-1685 has a specific affected version range
because it changed behaviors in 4.2.0.  Maybe that change came out of
followup analysis stemming from CVE-2006-1902.

But, I'm not completely sure.  Solar?
