Subject: wiki: pagemove, reconfiguration of default word separator for page names

Hello,

This is an update re: the recent changes in the Wiki configuration.

Josh had correctly pointed out that the requested pagemove functionality
didn't work as expected, I investigated this and found out that the
pagemove plugin was enabled to the admin group only.  I have fixed the
issue by adding an additional ACL check for managers (those who are
members of the editor group).

Those of you who see the Admin button at the bottom of the Wiki can use
the pagemove plugin from now on.  I've briefly described how to
move/rename a page at the following URL:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/wiki/plugins/hints/editor

Another important change is that I re-configured the Wiki to use '-'
(dash) instead of '_' (underscore) as a word separator for page names.
This was done per previous (unfortunately) private discussion to make
all pages look consistent.  This change has affected one Wiki page.
it's code-reviews.  Since that page contains a stub I thought that it's
OK that I've simply renamed the page without placing a proper redirect
back.  Please let me know if I was wrong and I'll put a redirection
there.
