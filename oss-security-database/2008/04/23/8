The reference you pointed to is for a fix in 1.1.18, which suggests that
1.1.17 is vulnerable.

Thanks for the clarification of the issue - the vendor's post only alluded
to "security" with no additional details, which left a lot of vuln DBs
guessing.

uhnames modules, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(daemon crash) via a large number of channel users with crafted
nicknames, idents, and long hostnames.
