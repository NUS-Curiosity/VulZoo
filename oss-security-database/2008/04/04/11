: Good idea.  Also, maybe you could invite them to join this mailing list? 
: (Perhaps ask me first to confirm that they are not already on the list.)

: BTW, we currently have two pages with vendor info: one is with security 
: contacts and advisory links, and the other is with "patch-finding" info. 
: Perhaps you should update both whenever you can obtain the necessary 
: info.  Or maybe we should combine them into one page - this needs to be

Just a reminder that the OSVDB Vendor Dictionary aims to capture this
