Holy Smokes that's impressive!

I don't think there's anything to consolidate, I think we just need to
ensure everything on the oss-security wiki page is in your data (I would be
surprised if it's not), then we just point at that.  The page about easily
finding patches is probably still relevant, but there's no sense in
duplicating information, especially when there is such an extensive source
as this.

Thanks!
