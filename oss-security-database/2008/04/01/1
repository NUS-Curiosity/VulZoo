According to the feedback Fedora maintainer got from new upstream,
comix 3.x is mostly dead and upstream is focused on re-written version
4.  See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=430635#c1 for
upstream reply.

That BZ also has some comments on the insecure temporary file usage
reported to Debian BTS.  And also notes that comix is likely an app
where unfixed tarfile python module may bite back.

As for comix vs. comicthumb, I guess once CVE id is sufficient.
