Subject: CVE request: firefox 2.0.14 ( Crash in JavaScript garbage collector)

Please assign a cve for 
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/known-vulnerabilities.html#firefox2.0.0.14
http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2008/mfsa2008-20.html

And again, are pure browser crashers considered security relevant? I'd do so, 
as e.g. placing a crashing gif on e.g. some popular wiki could cause much 
trouble:

(I think it's still unfixed)
