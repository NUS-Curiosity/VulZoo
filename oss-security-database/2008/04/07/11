FWIW, there are also actual gcc bugs that cause miscompiles - and they
may potentially result in security vulnerabilities - yet I am not sure
if "proactively" treating the gcc bugs themselves as security issues is
appropriate.  This is interesting - here we have a gcc non-bug that
deserves a CERT Vulnerability Note and a CVE number (which I agree
with), yet actual bugs might not deserve such treatment.

Here's an example of an actual bug -
http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=26587 - this one caused my
Blowfish implementation to be miscompiled, possibly making the cipher
weaker (in case the misbehavior went unnoticed).  By the way, I was
surprised by how quickly this one was confirmed (16 minutes) and fixed
(less than a day).
