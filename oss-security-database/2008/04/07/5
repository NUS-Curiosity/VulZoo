Subject: Re: [oCERT 2008-02] libfishsound insufficient boundary


Hi,

it turned out that Speex shares the same code that affects libfishsound, so
versions <= 1.1.12 are vulnerable. Speex 1.2beta contains the fix.

The advisory at http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2008-2.html has been
updated.

Cheers!
