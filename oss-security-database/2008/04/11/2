Subject: CVE request: Opera <9.27 Multiple issues

These are more than a week old, but I haven't see CVEs popping up yet. 
So here's a formal request ;-)

To quote the ChangeLog:
                 --------------
    * Fixed an issue where newsfeed prompts could cause Opera to execute 
arbitrary code, as reported by Michal Zalewski. See our advisory.
    * Solved an issue where resized canvas patterns could cause Opera to 
execute arbitrary code, as reported by Michal Zalewski. See our 
advisory.
    * Improved keyboard handling of password inputs, as reported by 
Trystan S. 
                --------------

I have no idea what the third vulnerability actually means.
