I've attached the patches from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 packages to
our Bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2008-0596#c5
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2008-0597#c6

Both issues should only affect old cups versions (rough guess is
pre-1.2, but we haven't really investigated where exactly they got
fixed), so as the version in Etch is 1.2.7, you probably do not need to
care.  They were not needed for 1.2.4 in RHEL5 according to our
maintainer.
