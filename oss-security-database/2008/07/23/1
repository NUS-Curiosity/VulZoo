It seems there is also a problem with newer dnsmasq that is very similar to
this:
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=232523

That problem appears to be pretty much the same thing, but affecting
versions 2.43 - 2.45

Did this ever get a CVE id?

I presume this new flaw will need one as well.

Thanks.
