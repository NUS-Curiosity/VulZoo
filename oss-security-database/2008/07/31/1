Subject: Mono ASP.net cross site scripting issue

Hi,

Dean Brettle found a cross site scripting issue in the ASP.net
class libraries of Mono and potentially also for MS.NET, where you
can inject code into the "action" of a FORM submit and the tags
HtmlInputRadioButton.Value, HtmlImage.Src and HtmlInputImage.Src.

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=413534
is our bugreport which was published on posting due to a
public QA contact mailinglist.

The proposed patch for the Html* parts is:

Steven, can you please assign a CVE id?

Ciao, Marcus
