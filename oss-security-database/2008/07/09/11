Quoting from http://members.home.nl/p.a.rombouts/pdnsd/doc.html :

query_port_start=number;
...
In case a query start port is given pdnsd uses this port as the first 
port of a specified port range (see query_port_end) used for queries. 
pdnsd will try to randomly select a free port from this range as local 
port for the query.
...

The sample configuration file that is shipped does not have this option 
set, the default value of this is "0". I can't currently test this on a 
kernel that does not randomize by default, so this domaind supports 
randomization, and *seems* to have it enabled by default.
