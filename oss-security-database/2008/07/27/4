Subject: cups patches for CVE-2008-0597 and CVE-2008-0596

Hi

I am working on a cups update at the moment and I am looking for two missing 
patches. Could somebody please email me the patches for CVE-2008-0596 and 
CVE-2008-0597 (both DoS due to crafted IPP packets and a large number of 
requests for adding and removing printers).
I saw them marked as fixed in the opensuse announcement, but couldn't find the 
patches for some reason and the novell bugzilla does not grant access to the 
bugs to everyone :/
Thanks heaps in advance.

Cheers
Steffen
