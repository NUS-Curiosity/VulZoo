(resending as the first one didn't make it to the list)

I finally had time to develop a PoC and confirm this on my own. A client
need only send a DHCPREQUEST for an IP address not on the same network
as dnsmasq. Eg:

1. dnsmasq listening on and giving IP addresses for 192.168.122.0/24
2. client requests IP address on another network, such as 192.168.0.1
3. dnsmasq 2.25 (and presumably earlier) crashes

This can happen in normal operation with roaming users, but can also
happen with a malicious request. Attached is a script to easily test for
this (requires python scapy).
