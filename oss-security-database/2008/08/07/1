Subject: CVE id request: git

Hi,
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/RelNotes-1.5.6.4.txt:
"* Various commands could overflow its internal buffer on a 
platform with small PATH_MAX value in a repository that has contents with
long pathnames."

An attacker can exploit this causing a stack-based buffer 
overflow if a victim user executes the git-diff or git-grep 
commands in a crafted repository.

Patch: 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=commitdiff;h=fd55a19eb1d49ae54008d932a65f79cd6fda45c9

Can someone assign a CVE id to this one?

Cheers
Nico
