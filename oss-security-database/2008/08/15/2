Subject: CVE id request: mktemp

Hi,
mktemp (not the coreutils one) from 
ftp://ftp.mktemp.org/pub/mktemp/ is not generating fully 
random names. Steve, can you assign a CVE id to this?

This is 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=495193
I wrote an explanation on why this happens, available on:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=495193#30

Kind regards
Nico
