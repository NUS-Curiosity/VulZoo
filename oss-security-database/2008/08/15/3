Subject: CVE-2008-3276 Linux kernel dccp_setsockopt_change() integer overflow

An integer overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel
dccp_setsockopt_change() function. The vulnerability exists due to a
lack of sanitisation performed on a user-controlled integer value before
the value is employed as the size argument of a memory allocation
operation. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to trigger a
kernel panic on a victim's machine remotely.

This affects kernel versions since 2.6.17-rc1. The proposed upstream
commit is: 3e8a0a559c66ee9e7468195691a56fefc3589740

I have allocated this CVE-2008-3276.

Thanks, Eugene
