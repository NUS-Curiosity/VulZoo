NVD's XML data feed is probably the best out there that's publicly
available.  Representatives of CVE-compatible product authors,
vulnerability databases, and software vendors can get direct access to an
email-based feed from MITRE, which is the feed that NVD uses.  MITRE
hasn't opened this to the general public because most people would use it
like a database, and we don't want to compete with other feeds out there.
Guess that's kind of silly these days given that NVD turns it around in 5
minutes, but there it is.
