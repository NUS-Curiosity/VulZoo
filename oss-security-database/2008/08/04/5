Good to know. Here at Debian we currently import all CVEs into our own system, 
and we use http://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/allitems.html.gz as the source 
for that.

Considering your statement we would better be using one of the XML Data feeds 
from http://nvd.nist.gov/download.cfm , right? Or would you recommend another 
feed (e.g. the one where NVD gets its data from)?


thanks,
Thijs
