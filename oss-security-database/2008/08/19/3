I have problems to understand why this would be a Denial of 
Service. While I don't share the opinion about browser 
crashes I think there are at least good arguments for both 
sides.

But if swfdec crashes on playing a flash movie this 
looks like an application bug. At least I wouldn't talk 
about Denial of Service if vim would crash on opening a text 
file.

It would be interesting what is causing this crash and if 
there is underlying a more serious issue.

Kind regards
Nico
