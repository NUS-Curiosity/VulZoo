Subject: swfdec 0.6.8 stable update

Hi,

Wonder if we should track updates for swfdec. The 0.6.8 announcement
looks like it at least fixes several Denial of Service problems:

http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/swfdec/2008-July/001801.html

	swfdec-0.6.8 ("Mario Rush")
	http://swfdec.freedesktop.org/download/swfdec/0.6/swfdec-0.6.8.tar.gz
	MD5: 740caf52068556ffe151703342fb634b

	Changes:
	- fix a crash when decoding 1x1 JPEG images
	- fix a crash in XMLSocket.send
	- fix crashes when FLV decoding was aborted
	- fix a crash in exception handling code
	- fix some infinite loops with prototype loops
	- fix crasher when handling broken dates
	- fix crashers with native constructors found in testing
	- compatibility fixes: compile with gold linker, make includes work from C++

(SUSE at least is shipping swfdec.)

Ciao, Marcus
