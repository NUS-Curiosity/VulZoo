Ok, sounds reasonable.

No idea whether a CVE should be assigned anyway -- if it does indeed 
allow for (local) code execution, that'd effectively mean bypass of 
safe_mode/open_basedir. Such issues already got CVEs assigned in the 
pass, so I guess this one should as well.

Local DoS only could be caused by several other means as well (infinite 
recursion, ...), so if somebody could prove it that it only allows for 
DoS, then there is probably no need for a CVE.


Thanks for your reply!
