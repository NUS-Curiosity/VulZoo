Yes

Yes, the one mentioned in 
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/28/3.

That's because Turba 2.1 is not affected, 2.2 is. The file and the 
vulnerable code doesn't exist.

Not really. Well, the issue is the same except that it's 
present in different source files. So there is no contact 
handling and the obrowser thing in horde, it's one piece of 
code to manage contacts in obrowser.

Yes, I already had contact to upstream and our maintainer 
before asking for a CVE id.

Kind regards
