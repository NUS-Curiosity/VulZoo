I agree that it doesn't sound like much of an issue (and setup.php being
left around sounds suspicious in itself), but we take the approach that if
a vendor thinks it's important enough to issue a security advisory, we'll
tag it on the assumption that vendors don't have any motivation to
over-inflate the importance of a bug without some consideration of
security risk.
