Subject: CVE id requests: ruby

Hi

It seems that there was another ruby release, which addresses some security 
fixes.
I guess the new ones are:

* Several vulnerabilities in safe level
* DoS vulnerability in WEBrick
* Lack of taintness check in dl

I didn't check their exploitability, but it might be good to have CVE ids for 
them anyway.

Cheers
Steffen
