Subject: CVE request: openfire login page XSS (JM-629)

Hi all,

a XSS issue in login.jsp in Openfire (formerly Wildfire) up to version 
3.5.2 (latest) is currently without fix and without CVE id:
  http://www.igniterealtime.org/issues/browse/JM-629
  https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=229515


The upstream bug report also mentions another login XSS that was fixed 
in 2005 -- http://www.igniterealtime.org/issues/browse/JM-430
