Same as the other fence_* issues.  Those tools are fencing agents used
by Red Hat Cluster Suite (tools that can be used by a cluster to make
sure that non-responding cluster member is really down, so shared
resources can be taken by some other cluster member;  they usually do
so by communicating with some remote device capable of cutting the
system from power, or reboot it (power switches, kvm switches, remote
consoles, ...)).

In the Cluster Suite for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, they were packaged
in the fence package.  Cluster Suite for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 has
them in cman package (Cluster Manager).

Other vendors shipping Cluster Suite are likely to have them packaged
in packages named as fence and cman, or similar, based on the version
they use.
