Do we still call things that require register_globals to be on a
'vulnerability'?

Register_globals has been advertised (including in the PHP documentation
of that option) as a very bad idea for many years now, it's turned off by
default since years aswell. Turning it on could be considered as knowingly
taking the risk on a certain class of exploits.

At least Debian doesn't provide any security support for these issues.
