Subject: Re: CVE request phpmyadmin (Fwd: XSS in phpMyadmin)


We generally assign CVE's for issues requiring register_globals because
there are common configurations in which this is enabled, e.g. hosting
environments or older PHP deployments. Many PHP-based worms wouldn't
succeed without this setting.  Also, in some cases, the software requires
it.  Finally, in some cases, a researcher CLAIMS register_globals is
required but is erroneous (in this specific case, Secunia doesn't say
register_globals is required, and they typically do this.)

register_globals might limit the applicability to environments where the
admin doesn't (or can't) follow solid configuration practices, but it's
still feasible.

Name: CVE-2008-4775
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4775
Reference: BUGTRAQ:20081027 XSS in phpMyadmin
Reference: URL:http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/497815/100/0/threaded

Reference: SECUNIA:32449
Reference: URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/32449

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in pmd_pdf.php in phpMyAdmin
3.0.0, and possibly other versions including 2.11.9.2 and 3.0.1, when
register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via the db parameter, a different vector
than CVE-2006-6942 and CVE-2007-5977.
