Subject: CVE request: jhead

Hi,

Marc Merlin and John Dong discovered several vulnerabilities in jhead.
Upstream was contacted, who later released jhead 2.84 [1]. Initial
report can be seen in Ubuntu's bug tracker [2].

CC'ing John, as he is who found the majority of the issues and
coordinated with upstream.

Jamie
