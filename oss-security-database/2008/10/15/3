Stack-based buffer overflow in the push_subg function in parser.y
(lib/graph/parser.c) in Graphviz 2.20.2, and possibly earlier
versions, allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption) or execute arbitrary code via a DOT file
with a large number of Agraph_t elements.
