Subject: CVE-2008-3832 kernel: null pointer dereference in utrace_control

Michael Simms reported that it is possible for an unprivileged user to
crash the machine by running gdb on a running process with pid 1.

This affects the version of utrace as shipped with Fedora 8 and 9. This
is addressed in kernel-2.6.26.5-28 for Fedora 8, and kernel-2.6.26.5-45
for Fedora 9. This issue is specific to Fedora, and does not affect
upstream or any of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernels.
