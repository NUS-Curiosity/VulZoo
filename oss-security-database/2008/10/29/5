Well obviously. The attack would be convincing someone to debug an
application with a testcase provided in a tarball, or to debug something
in a specific directory.

If you just dumped one in /tmp on a system I use and waited a few weeks,
there's a strong possibility you would pwn me.

Of course, guess who reported that ;-) (me).

The patch to make those checks was provided by me. I'm suggesting
valgrind should do the same thing.

Thanks, Tavis.
