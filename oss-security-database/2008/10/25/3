Subject: CVE request: lynx (old) .mailcap handling flaw

Hi Steven!

There's one old lynx issue that seem to need a 2006 CVE id.  lynx
browser prior to 2.8.6rel.4 tries to open mailcap and mime type
definition files form the current directory.  If user can be convinced
to run lynx in a specially crafted directory, an attacker controlling
the directory may be able to run arbitrary code as the victim running
lynx.

Issue was originally reported in Debian BTS:
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=396949

Some details can be found in our BZ as well:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=214205

Thank you!
