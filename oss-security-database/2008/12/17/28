If there's CSRF then that would be a separate issue.

If ";" is also allowed then there might be some possibilities for odd
entity encodings, but I don't know if that would translate directly into
XSS.  A simple, likely-incorrect example might be "&lt;" which would
decode into "<" but the browser would treat it as a literal "<" instead of
the start of a tag.
