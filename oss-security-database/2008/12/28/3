Martin VÃ¤th also discovered an untrusted search path vulnerability in 
the pdfjam scripts: They prepend . to PATH, allowing attackers to 
execute code by preparing executables (e.g. sed) in the directory 
pdfnup was run from or in /var/tmp (e.g. pdflatex, cp, rm).

Martin also prepared a patch, see:
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=252734

Please assign another CVE for this issue.
