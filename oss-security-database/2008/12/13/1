I became aware of some sort of code execution vulnerability one day before that
ticket was reported. After reviewing the file I determined that it isn't a
vulnerability in roundcube, but in PHP itself; but I'm open to be proved wrong.

Note that I have not yet determined how exactly the vulnerability is being
exploited, but am working on it.
