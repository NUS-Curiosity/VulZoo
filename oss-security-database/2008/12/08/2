CVE id 2008-5028 has been assigned to this. I requested a CVE id through this list
on Nov 6 2008. Fairly full details on the two issues described in my original email
(Message-Id: <49131C7E.8050105@....se>) can be found at http://blogs.op5.org

The patch has been publicly available since Nov 7, when I announced it on the
nagios-devel mailing list.

Both issues were reported to the Nagios dev team by Tim Starling on Oct 26.
