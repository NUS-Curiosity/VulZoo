    MIPS: Fix potential DOS by untrusted user app.

    On a 64 bit kernel if an o32 syscall was made with a syscall number less
    than 4000, we would read the function from outside of the bounds of the
    syscall table.  This led to non-deterministic behavior including system
    crashes.

    While we were at it we reworked the 32 bit version as well to use fewer
    instructions.  Both 32 and 64 bit versions are use the same code now.
