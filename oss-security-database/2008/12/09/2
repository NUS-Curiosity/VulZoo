Subject: CVE request: kernel: enforce a minimum SG_IO timeout

This requires a CVE name. Please assign one. Thanks.

Alan Cox reported that libata needs to enforce sensible minimum
timeouts on SG_IO requests otherwise a local, unprivileged user can
trigger long spews of errors and forces the drives into PIO run as any
user.

To trigger this problem, you need to be able to open the cdrom device
(i.e. login as a normal user from the console and then access it via
ssh) or access to /dev/sg* which is root only in all sane systems.

Thanks, Eugene
