It was, see NVD site.

CVE-2008-5050

Off-by-one error in the get_unicode_name function
(libclamav/vba_extract.c) in Clam Anti-Virus (ClamAV) before 0.94.1
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted VBA project file, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
