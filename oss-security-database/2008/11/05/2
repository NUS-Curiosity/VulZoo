Subject: CVE Request - Python string expandtabs

Hello!

  yesterday looked yet at the Python issues reported
by Chris Evans at:

http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2008-008.html

and found out, the issue:

* Integer overflow in string expandtabs operation

*  PoC: s = 't\tt\t'
        str.expandtabs(s, 2147483647)

  still lacks its own separate CVE identifier.

  Different issue than CVE-2008-2315.

  Reasoning:
  =========

  Integer overflows in stringobject.c and unicodeobject.c 
  in Python 2.5.2 are part of CVE-2008-2315, but
  part of CVE-2008-2315 is also mention about patch:
  
  http://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=159418&action=view

  which by itself is not sufficient to resolve this flaw.

  Upstream has applied the following patch:
  ========================================= 

  http://svn.python.org/view?rev=61350&view=rev

  Have checked by above PoC that applying this patch
  solves this vulnerability.

  Affected Python versions: 2.2.3 <= x <= 2.5.1
  =========================

Chris, can you confirm my investigation?

Steve, could you allocate a new CVE id?

Thanks, Jan.
