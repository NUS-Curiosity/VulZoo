[xine-user dropped; should probably have been sent to xine-devel, and this
thread doesn't seem to be appearing there anyway]

I demand that Matthias Hopf may or may not have written...

I'd appreciate these *not* being committed to the 1.1 tip: just make sure
that I get the patch series (no more than one CVE no. per patch), prepared so
that I can just "hg import" each one, and I'll handle things from there.
(Somebody, probably me, will have to backport at least some of this lot for
etch, and separate patches should make this a bit easier.)

I'm currently not sure whether to do 1.1.15.1 or 1.1.16, mainly because
1.1.15.1 can be uploaded to unstable and still make it into lenny; OTOH,
that'd be a new sourceful upload. And I'm not sure that we're ready for
1.1.16 yet anyway.
