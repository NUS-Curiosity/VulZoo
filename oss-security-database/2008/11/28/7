Isn't the second part of CVE-2008-5234 the same like 
CVE-2008-5246? About CVE-2008-5246 and the provenance of 
this information, I can hereby confirm this.
See http://hg.debian.org/hg/xine-lib/xine-lib?cmd=changeset;node=268c1c1639d7;style=gitweb

the length is user supplied + 1 used to allocate a buffer 
which is used for a read call later -> typical heap 
overflow.

Cheers
Nico
