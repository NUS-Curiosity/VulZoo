======================================================
Name: CVE-2008-5113
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5113
Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20081113 CVE request: wordpress can be subject of delayed attacks via cookies
Reference: URL:http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/11/14/1
Reference: CONFIRM:http://bugs.debian.org/504771

WordPress 2.6.3 relies on the REQUEST superglobal array in certain
dangerous situations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
conduct delayed and persistent cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
attacks via crafted cookies, as demonstrated by attacks that (1)
delete user accounts or (2) cause a denial of service (loss of
application access).  NOTE: this issue relies on the presence of an
independent vulnerability that allows cookie injection.
