To be honest, I'm not entirely familiar with the bug. I have Cc'ed
Mauro who is the maintainer of the driver, and he should be able to
share with us more about it.

Mauro, can you explain to us the implications of not including the
"V4L/DVB (9621): Avoid writing outside shadow.bytes[] array" fix, and
if it has a security consequence?

Thanks, Eugene
