Please note that as it was discuissed in thread started with
  http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/11/19/4
even 1.3.9 is crashable by non-root authenticated users by adding
a big number of subscriptions (don't know about RSS ones, though
subscription for mailing upon job completion does its job).  But
I imagine that CVE-2008-5184 can't be used for 1.3.9, so remote
attack is not feasible.

I expect that the fix will go into 1.3.10:
  http://svn.easysw.com/public/cups/trunk/CHANGES-1.3.txt

Adding Michael Sweet to the CC, since he can shed a bit more light on
this matter.  Perhaps CVE-2008-5183 should be extended or another CVE
can be created.
