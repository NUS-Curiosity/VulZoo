SECUNIA:32796 suggests a Debian bug report, but I couldn't quickly find
it.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2008-5187
Status: Candidate
URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5187
Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20081120 CVE Request: imlib2
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/11/20/5
Reference: SECUNIA:32796
Reference: URL:http://secunia.com/advisories/32796

The load function in the XPM loader for imlib2 1.4.2, and possibly
other versions, allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
crafted XPM file that triggers a "pointer arithmetic error" and a
heap-based buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than
CVE-2008-2426.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown;
the details are obtained solely from third party information.
