CUE: 0.5.0 - 0.9.5 (as per http://www.videolan.org/security/sa0810.html)
RealText: 0.9.0 - 0.9.5

0.9.* is the only supported version from videolan.org anyway.

CVE.mitre.org says nothing about vendor obtaining a CVE number, only
researchers. And typically, these guys don't do it, when dealing with
videolan.org anyway.

Also consider our project structure: We have a large code base with lots of
legacy, so lots of bugs. We have a large user base, so we're an attractive
target. We have had very few security analysis until recently, so there is
a lot more CVEs to come by any chance. We're almost entirely run by loosely
coordinated volunteers (including myself) so you cannot expect much more
dedication. And we are hardly supported by distributions (basically only
Debian and Gentoo), such that almost nobody will care on vendor-sec.

Now I am happy to adapt our security handling process a bit, if MITRE,
Debian or whatever other involved party wants. But I am still waiting for
clear guidelines.

N.B.: I am not subscribed to this mailing list
