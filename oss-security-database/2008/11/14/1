Subject:  CVE request: wordpress can be subject of delayed attacks via cookies

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

Due to the completely incorrect usage of $_REQUEST almost all over the place 
wordpress is subject to delayed attacks via cookies.

The attack can be performed as long as there is some way to inject a cookie 
which is sent by the browser to the server.

More info at http://bugs.debian.org/504771

Could a CVE id be assigned please?

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,
