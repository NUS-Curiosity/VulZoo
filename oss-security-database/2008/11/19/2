Subject: CVE Request: ruby on rails header injection

Hi,

A header injection bug in ruby on rails was fixed some time ago but
doesn't seem to have CVE number yet:
http://www.rorsecurity.info/journal/2008/10/20/header-injection-and-response-splitting.html
http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/10/19/rails-2-0-5-redirect_to-and-offset-limit-sanitizing
