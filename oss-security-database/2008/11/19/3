Subject: CVE request: CUPS DoS via RSS subscriptions

Hello!

I'd like to get a CVE assigned for the RSS subscription DoS mentioned
here[1].  It seems that CUPS upstream already fixed[2] the issue[3] in
their 1.3.8 release.  Prior to 1.3.8, the server can be made to crash
when visiting a malicious website due to CUPS general CSRF issues.

Thanks,

-Kees
