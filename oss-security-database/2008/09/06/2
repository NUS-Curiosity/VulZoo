Subject: CVE id requests: gmanedit

Hi

There are two possible buffer overflows in gmanedit. One is via crafted 
configuration file and the other one via crafted manual page.
See the Debian bug report for more information.
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=497835

Could I please get CVE ids for these issues?

Cheers
Steffen
