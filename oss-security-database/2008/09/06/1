v0.47 (September 04 2008)
=========================
This release incorporates a security fix (item 3 on the list).
All administrators who have enabled <luserconf> in the configuration
file should upgrade. A workaround is to comment out <luserconf>.

- mount.crypt: add missing null command to conform to sh syntax
  (SF bug #2089446)
- conf: fix printing of strings when luser volume options were not ok
- conf: re-add luserconf security checks
[...]
