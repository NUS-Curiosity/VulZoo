Subject: CVE id request: newsbeuter

Hi,
newsbeuter (http://www.newsbeuter.org) 1.1 fixes a security 
issue that was discovered by J.H.M. Dassen (Ray) and is 
fixed in svn revision 1429.

The previous version allowed to execute arbitrary code by a 
crafted feed URL that is passed as a command line parameter 
if the URL is opened by an external browser.

Upstream changelog:
 1.1:
        Added a line wrap for the article view's headers and the link list on the bottom (fixes Debian issue #491122)
        Added test suite for functional tests of the user interface
        Fixed quoting issue in open-in-browser command
        ^^^^^

This issue should affect all newsbeuter versions < 1.1.

Can I get a CVE id for this please?

Kind regards
Nico
