Unfortunately, all messages prior to this change of setting will expire 
and be removed from Gmane on March 9, because they have been added on
February 24. Can you please contact the Gmane folks to remove the 
X-No-Archive from the mails or just ignore it list-wide, or is that 
intentional?

Thanks,
