The patch doesn't apply by itself, without the previous one, and is not
quite correct. If the user created a vulnerable actions file (by
launching centerim before), that one won't be overwritten without manual
action taken by the user.

Also, the script is not technically correct (overriding DISPLAY
variable), and is completely useless bloat. Upstream is aware of this
and concentrates on making CIM5 better :)

Fedora will use this patch [1], that removes configurable actions
completely.

Note that current Yahoo IM implementation will not work after April 2nd,
and new one is not yet complete. It might make sense to delay the update
a few days and grab the YIM patches from mob branch then.
