Subject: CVE request: lighttpd DoS: forcefully closing of foreign SSL connections

Hi,

can we please get a CVE id for the following issue?
https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214892
http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/ticket/285#comment:18
http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/changeset/2136

Impact is rather low, but I think it still qualifies for DoS.

Thanks,
