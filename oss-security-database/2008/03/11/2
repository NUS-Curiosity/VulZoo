Subject: CVE request: insecure X11 handling in ltsp

Hi,
Due to passing the -ac option to the X server in ltsp it is possible for any
attacker knowing the victims ip address and the display number to read keystrokes
on the client and display client windows.

Can I get a CVE id for this?
Details on: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=469462

Cheers
Nico
