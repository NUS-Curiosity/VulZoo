Subject: CVE request: lighttpd mod_cgi script source disclosure

Hey all,

mod_cgi in lighttpd 1.4.18 (and earlier?) will send the source of a cgi 
script if it fails to fork the cgi handler, instead of an HTTP 500. 
mod_cgi is disabled by default.

See for a patch:
  http://trac.lighttpd.net/trac/changeset/2107
  https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211956

Please assign a CVE id.


Thanks, Robert
