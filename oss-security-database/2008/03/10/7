| Name: CVE-2008-1271
| Status: Candidate
| URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1271
| Reference: MLIST:[Dovecot-news] 20080309 v1.0.13 and v1.1.rc3 released
| Reference:

| Reference: MLIST:[Dovecot-news] 20080309 Security hole #6: Some
passdbs allowed users to log in without a valid password
| Reference:
URL:http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2008-March/000064.html
|
| Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and
| 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote
| attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB
| characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the
| skip_password_check field to be specified.

So, we shouldn't be using CVE-2008-1218 for this (as you indicated
yesterday)?
