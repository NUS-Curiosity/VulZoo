I think this list is pretty public, and is intentionally so.  There
should be no reason to hold back referring to oss-security messages as
references for CVE names or any other vuln DB... in fact, this may even
help the list to grow (which is ultimately what we want... within
reason, of course).

I see no problem with this.
