Subject: CVEs for zzuf crashers?

Hi,

Sam Hovecar has created zzuf more than a year ago and posted a bunch of 
samples crashing various multimedia and other apps:
http://sam.zoy.org/blog/2007-01-16-exposing-file-parsing-vulnerabilities

I've done some re-testing about a year later:
http://hboeck.de/archives/578-How-long-does-it-take-to-fix-a-crash-bug.html

Some are still unfixed, I recently opened some upstream bug reports:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=424333
also mentioned on http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/27243
http://bugs.xine-project.org/show_bug.cgi?id=74
http://bugzilla.mplayerhq.hu/show_bug.cgi?id=1043
(gstreamer not done yet, waiting for 0.10.18 to land in gentoo)

At least the firefox issue and the still open mediaplayer crashers could have 
their own CVE (if there aren't already ones for it).
