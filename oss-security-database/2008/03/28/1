That would be great.

Isn't that actually desirable?  I mean, stuff being posted to
oss-security is supposed to be either already public or intended to be
made public right away.

Please go for it!

If you can, please use the official archive URLs, currently at:

	http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/

In case this is moved - e.g., to the oss-security website - we'll make
sure to put proper redirects in place, such that every message's URL
remains valid.  While the software powering this archive is currently
quite spartan, I think it suffices this purpose (CVE refs) well - and
its further development was just revitalized.

By the way, maybe we should also add a link to the oss-security wiki to
page footers on that archive?  Or even to message trailers (such that
the wiki link will be seen on third-party archives as well)?

Oh, and someone should write a wiki page about getting CVE IDs.  This is
currently mentioned as a FIXME here:

Thanks,

Alexander
