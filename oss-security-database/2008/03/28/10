Indeed, answering an or question with a yes isn't quite right.  I like the
idea of adding a link on the archive pages, but I'm not so sure about the
messages themselves.  There is the obvious advantage if the URL gets into
third party archives, but at the same time, we would be polluting the
message.  I've never liked mailing list footers,  I find them to be
eyesores.
