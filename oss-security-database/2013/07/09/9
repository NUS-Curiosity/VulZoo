So I've actually updated the CVE wikipedia page because I've seen this
question so many times =)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures

When investigating a vulnerability or potential vulnerability it helps
to acquire a CVE number early on. CVE numbers may not appear in the
Mitre or NVD CVE databases for some time (days, weeks, months or
potentially years) due to issues that are embargoed (the CVE number
has been assigned but the issue has not been made public), or in cases
where the entry is not researched and written up by Mitre due to
resource issues. The benefit of early CVE candidacy is that all future
correspondence can refer to the CVE number. Information on getting CVE
identifiers for Open Source issues is available from Red Hat.
