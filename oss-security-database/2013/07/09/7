Subject: Linux kernel libceph NULL function pointer dereference
 (CVE-2013-1059)

Chanam Park discovered that a crafted auth_reply message could cause a
NULL function pointer dereference in the libceph auth_none handler. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service.

If a malicious Ceph monitor sends an auth_reply message with the value
of -EAGAIN in the result field, ceph_build_auth_request() will call the
ceph_auth_client_ops->build_request() function pointer without checking
to see if the build_request() pointer is NULL. The auth_none handler
does not initialize its build_request() pointer.

See http://hkpco.kr/advisory/CVE-2013-1059.txt for more information.

The fix can be found in the upstream ceph-client.git tree:
