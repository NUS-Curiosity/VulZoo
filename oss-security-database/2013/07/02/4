Just to make sure -- this triggers Red Hat specific bug introduced via
CVE-2012-3552 fix [1, 2]. This issue does not affect upstream.

Spender suggest there is a integer problem in the code [3], but there is
not. The problem spender is trying to fix is avoided by the CMSG_OK
check in ip_cmsg_send() function and msg_controllen check in
__sys_sendmsg().

There is some slight room for error though since CMSG_OK checks for
"(cmsg)->cmsg_len >= sizeof(struct cmsghdr)" and the expression is
"err = cmsg->cmsg_len - CMSG_ALIGN(sizeof(struct cmsghdr));" but with
the current alignment and cmsghdr struct size we should be fine on
both 32 and 64bit.
