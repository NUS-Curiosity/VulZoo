So to confirm, we're talking about the line:

"Verification is not needed when downloading from central index, and
should be avoided to reduce the computation overhead."

So accessing the central index is done over HTTP by default, no
support for HTTPS previous to commit
https://github.com/pypa/pip/commit/e80c387a26858c4d7ff43c5f030b04b03fd43dfe
correct?
