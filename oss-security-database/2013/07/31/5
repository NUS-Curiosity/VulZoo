If it's embargo'd it's news to me. The details (I assume) are here https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=968059

As far as I know none of the pip maintainers requested it. I assume (going by the bugzilla) that CVE is for the fact pip didn't use TLS or any other authentication method when downloading from the central index. That was fixed in 1.3 which was releases March 2013.

I don't know who "owns" that CVE or anything about it. The only reason I even know it exists is the red hat page showed up in a google search when I was looking for pip CVE's to match fixes up to. I'm not sure what I can (if anything?) do as a pip developer to unreserve it?
