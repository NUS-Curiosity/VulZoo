Ha, Awesome. This CVE is some sort of ghost ;)

Debian bug links to https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1629

Which links to.. This conversation in oss-sec, NVD which says it doesn't exist, The RedHat Bugzilla, Gentoo which says it doesn't exist, Ubuntu which says it does but doesn't give any more info other than linking to the page on Mitre that just says the reserved bit.

A google search turns up http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/17rfh7/warning_dont_use_pip_in_an_untrusted_network_a/c8ay4xt but it's unclear if that person requested the CVE or not.

So uh how do we figure it out? Can I as a pip developer contact Mitre and release data for it?
