Subject: CVE-2013-4137: StatusNet v1.1.0: SQL injection

This is an advisory for StatusNet v1.0.0 through v1.1.0.

Multiple user-facing functions do not sanitize API input before interpolating it into database query strings.  This can result of exfiltration of database data, and depending on MySQL server (mis)configuration, can also result in file I/O to the database server disk.

StatusNet versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 have been released to correct these issues.  Patching to these versions as soon as possible is advised.  For more information, visit:
