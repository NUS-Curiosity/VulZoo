Subject: CVE Request - xlockmore 5.43 fixes a security flaw

Hello Kurt, vendors, et al.

xlockmore 5.43 released 2 days ago with a fix for a security
flaw related to potential NULL pointer dereferences when
authenticating via glibc 2.17+ crypt() and OSF/1 C2 security's
dispcrypt().

Under certain conditions the NULL pointers can trigger a crash
in xlockmore effectively bypassing the screen lock.
