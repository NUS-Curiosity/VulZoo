Subject: CVE Request: Insecure Software Download in pip

I'd like to request a CVE for pip (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/).

The mirroring support (-M, --use-mirrors) was implemented without any sort of authenticity checks and is downloaded over plaintext HTTP. Further more by default it will dynamically discover the list of available mirrors by querying a DNS entry and extrapolating from that data. It does not attempt to use any sort of method of securing this querying of the DNS like DNSSEC. Software packages are downloaded over these insecure links, unpacked, and then typically the setup.py python file inside of them is executed.

The vulnerable code is located at:
    - https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/develop/pip/index.py#L60-L64
    - https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/develop/pip/index.py#L205-L207
    - https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/develop/pip/index.py#L553-L572
    - https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/develop/pip/index.py#L999-L1024

The affected versions are every released version since 0.8.1 which are:
    0.8.1, 0.8.2, 0.8.3, 1.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.3, 1.3.1, 1.4

I'm not aware of this issue having ever had a CVE requested for it and my attempts to search the CVE database did not appear to turn up anything relevant but the search doesn't appear to be the greatest so I may have missed it.

I'm hoping to land a patch for this in a future release (current iteration of patch available at https://github.com/dstufft/pip/compare/remove-mirror-support) but there is no planned fix version as of yet.
