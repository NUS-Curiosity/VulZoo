Subject: CVE missing? for "Exim with Dovecot: Typical Misconfiguration Leads
 to Remote Command Execution"

Hi All,

I couldn't find the CVE number for the following vulnerability/misconfiguration:

https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2013-001/-exim-with-dovecot-typical-misconfiguration-leads-to-remote-command-execution

Is there a CVE assigned for this combo vulnerability in Exim/Dovecot?
or as this is a configuration matter there is no CVE assigned (even if
this "recommended configuration" was in the wiki of the vendor)?

Thanks for any feedback,

Cheers
