I'm not sure I understand this one. Is this just the external urls? Technically it wasn't a problem with the regexp's they worked fine. It was just bad behavior inherited from legacy systems. 1.4.x defaults to allowing them but enables people to turn them off, 1.5.x will disallow them by default.

1.3.x and earlier allowed them and offered no way to disable them.

Strictly speaking pip doesn't default to any hash. It just uses the hash given to it. Prior to 1.2 it only allowed MD5 but since the release of 1.2 it has allowed any of the guaranteed hashes in python's hash lib.

See: https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/467

Setuptools has also historically only allowed MD5 but has recently with version 0.9+ enabled similar abilities to setuptools to enable the use of any available hashes as well. Distribute (a fork of setuptools which has now been merged back into setuptools) only supports MD5 in it's older releases.
