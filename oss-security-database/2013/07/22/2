Subject: CVE request: webcalendar before 1.2.7

Hello,

Can I please have three CVEs for webcalendar?

http://sourceforge.net/projects/webcalendar/files/webcalendar%201.2/1.2.7/

 - Security fix: Do not show the reason for a failed login (i.e. "no
   such user")
 - Security fix: Escape HTML characters in category name.
 - Security fix: Check all passed in fields (either via HTML form or via
   URL parameter) for certain malicious tags (script, embed, etc.) and
   generate fatal error if found.

I'm not sure if the first is really considered CVE-relevant.
