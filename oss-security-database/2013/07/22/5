Subject: CVE request for Drupal contributed modules

Hi there, I'd like to request CVE identifiers for two modules:

SA-CONTRIB-2013-058 - MRBS - Abandoned - Mutliple
vulnerabilities<https://drupal.org/node/2044173>
https://drupal.org/node/2044173

SA-CONTRIB-2013-059 - Hostmaster (Aegir) - Access Bypass
https://drupal.org/node/2044299

The first one has been abandoned.

Thanks!

Forest
