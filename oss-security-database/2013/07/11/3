Subject: CVE Request -- Nagstamon (prior 0.9.10): Monitor server user
 credentials exposure in automated requests to get update information

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  an user details information exposure flaw was found in the way Nagstamon,
Nagios status monitor for desktop, performed automated requests to get
information about available updates. Remote attacker could use this flaw
to obtain user credentials for server monitored by the desktop status
monitor due to their improper (base64 encoding based) encoding in the
HTTP request, when the HTTP Basic authentication scheme was used.

Can you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
