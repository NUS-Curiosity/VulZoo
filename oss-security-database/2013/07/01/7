You're the one to add your information to the wiki (just register for an
account and edit the page), and this is desirable regardless of whether
you'd be on the private distros list or not.  I went to your website at
http://www.enea.com and was not able to (quickly) find any information
on your security response, advisories, software updates, etc.  Without
such information, we cannot even consider you for membership of the
private list.

Thanks,

Alexander
