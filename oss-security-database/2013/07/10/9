Cryptocat 2.1 does indeed fix the issue.

The thing is, Cryptocat only started being a serious project since the 2.0 release in late September 2012. Anything before that, to me, would simply not be worth of a CVE because it was nothing more than a bedroom project used by a handful of people.

We only started getting funding and media coverage in July/August 2012, followed by a complete re-engineering and re-release of the project. THAT's why there are so many changes to the key size.
