Subject: CVE Request: libxml2 external parsed entities issue

Hello,

libxml2 earlier than 2.9.0 fetches external parsed entities by default, with no
way to disable the behaviour.

Fixed by the following commit:

https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=4629ee02ac649c27f9c0cf98ba017c6b5526070f

More Information:

https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/693
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libxml2/+bug/1194410


Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?

Thanks,

Marc.
