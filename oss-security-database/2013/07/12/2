to clarify our current stable version is 1.0.2. FreeRDP version 1.1.0 is *beta* and 
still under development and therefore not stable or production ready and 
subject to frequent changes (as [1] also stated).

Hardening.

Neither nor.

There might also be some misunderstanding. The initial CVE request stated that
1.1.0-beta1 corrected these flaws but as a matter of fact only the commits from pull request 
887 and commit 7d58aac24fe20ffaad7bd9b40c9ddf457c1b06e7 are contained. - The other issues are 
fixed in our git master branch. 

We've created a snapshot that contains all the fixes mentioned above:

http://pub.freerdp.com/releases/freerdp-1.1.0-beta+2013071101.tar.gz
md5: 108f8404b210ea789226cbca65c43724
sha1: a79d0174b0487abb900601c67572aa6dbfc12629

We will also review our current stable version to check if the issues 
exist there as well and publish an update if required.

Thank you,
best regards,
Bernhard
