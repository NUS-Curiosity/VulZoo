Upstream discussion, including reps from both Red Hat & SuSE, determined
it didn't need a CVE, since it can only be triggered by a client authorized
to connect to the Xserver (via xauth, xhost, etc.) and such a client, by
design, can lock all other clients out from the server, kill clients, etc.

It would be like wanting a CVE for the fact that another process running
under your UID can kill your process.

Not sure why SuSE decided to go ahead and release it as a security fix
anyway - it's certainly a bug fix though.
