>8) http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2013-24.html

Use CVE-2013-3556 for the Bug 8599 issue addressed in r48943.

Use CVE-2013-3557 for the Bug 8599 issue addressed in r48944.

It is possible that CVE-2013-3556 only affects people who made their
own builds from the Wireshark trunk, and does not affect users of any
Wireshark release. Although MITRE does not always assign CVE names for
such development-code issues, in this case it is useful for clarifying
the scope of CVE-2013-3557.

>   Further Note regarding 9):
>   The CVE-2013-2486 && CVE-2013-2487 identifiers
>   have been originally assigned for the 9) issue for the
