Subject: CVE request: WordPress advanced-xml-reader XXE

Can I get 2013 CVE for issue:

Advanced XML Reader Plugin for WordPress contains an XXE (Xml eXternal Entity)
injection flaw that is triggered during the parsing of XML data. The issue is
due to an incorrectly configured XML parser accepting XML external entities from
an untrusted source. By sending specially crafted XML data, a remote attacker
can gain access to arbitrary files.

This issue is not yet fixed.
