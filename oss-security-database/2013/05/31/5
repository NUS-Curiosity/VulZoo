Subject: CVE Request: libimobiledevice insecure /tmp use

Hello,

In libimobiledevice, the following commit:

http://cgit.sukimashita.com/libimobiledevice.git/commit/src?id=825d...

Falls back to creating files in /tmp if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and $HOME are
unset. In some distros, upowerd runs this as root, which causes files in
/tmp to be created and updated in an insecure manner as root, allowing
for symlink attacks.

Bugs:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libimobiledevice/+bug/1164263

Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?

Thanks,

Marc.
