For debian, this suggestion was made in http://bugs.debian.org/610712
for the "uscan" tool, which looks for new upstream releases.

I've just supplied a patch to that bug with a simple implementation for
the common case where the signatures are distributed alongside the
tarballs with a similar name, and are made by one of a small set of
known keys.

It has some flaws, but it's certainly better than doing nothing.  I
welcome review and/or feedback and suggestions on that bug report.
