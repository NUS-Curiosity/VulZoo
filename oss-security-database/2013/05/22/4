Note: I found a similar commit in dovecot-2.2 repo:

http://hg.dovecot.org/dovecot-2.2/rev/0b7039a614f7

the commit message says " imap: Fixed assert-crash on invalid APPEND
parameters."

I am not very familiar with the dovecot code, but taking a brief look
suggests that parsing APPEND in some way could result in hitting assert.
