This seems like a configuration issue rather than a vulnerability. The code in libhttpd.c seems to filter directory traversal sequences. And I was able to reproduce this only if thttpd was serving files out of the system root directory (e.g., "thttpd -d /"), in which case the directory traversal sequences are irrelevant.
