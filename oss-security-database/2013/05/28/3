Subject: CVE request: libraw: multiple issues

Hi,

>From [1]:
> LibRaw 0.15.1 (26-05-2013)
This should be 0.15.2

> Fixed possible double-free() on error recovery on damaged full-color (Foveon, sRAW) files.

>
> LibRaw 0.15.1 (24-05-2013)

> check for possible buffer overrun in exposure correction code

So there's a double-free (fixed in 0.15.2[3]) and a buffer overflow
(fixed in 0.15.1[2]).

Could CVE ids be assigned please?
