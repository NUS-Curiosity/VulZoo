Subject: GnuTLS 2.x Lucky13 fix regression CVE-2013-2116

Hi!

This upstream gnutls-devel list thread points out an OOB read bug
introduced via the Lucky13 / CVE-2013-1619 fix for GnuTLS 2.x.

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/6753

This possibly allows crashing TLS servers using GnuTLS remotely.
Upstream version 2.12.23 and vendor versions with 2.x patch backported
should be affected.  Upstream 3.x versions used different patch not
affected by this issue.

CVE-2013-2116 was assigned to this issue.
