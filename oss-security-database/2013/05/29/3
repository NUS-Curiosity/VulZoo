Small adjustment to the subject line.

Just to be clear this affects:

1.20.x, x <= 6
1.21.x, all x (this is an obsolete development branch)
1.22.0
1.23.0

NOT affected are:

anything < 1.20
1.20.7 (fix backported to this stable version yesterday)
1.22.1 (fix backported to this stable version yesterday)
1.23.1 (this is the upstream version, fixed yesterday)

Credit for finding the bug goes to the Coverity static analyzer.

Rich.
