Subject: CVE Request -- libguestfs (1.21.6 | 1.22.0 | 1.23.0 <= X < 1.22.1 |
 1.23.1): Denial of service due to a double-free when inspecting certain
 guest files / images

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  LibguestFS upstream has issued the following patch:
  [1] https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/commit/fa6a76050d82894365dfe32916903ef7fee3ffcd

to correct a double-free flaw in the virt-inspector / other virt-* tools,
which could lead to denial of service if some of the tools were used by
3rd party applications for inspection of untrusted guest files / images:

  [2] https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2013-May/msg00079.html
  [3] https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2013-May/msg00080.html

Could you allocate a CVE identifier for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
