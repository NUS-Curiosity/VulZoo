             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-1952 / XSA-49
                              version 2

        VT-d interrupt remapping source validation flaw for bridges

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Interrupt remapping table entries for MSI interrupts set up by bridge
devices did not get any source validation set up on them, allowing
misbehaving or malicious guests to inject interrupts into the domain
owning the bridges.

In a typical Xen system bridge devices are owned by domain 0, leaving
it vulnerable to such an attack. Such a DoS is likely to have an impact
on other guests running in the system.

IMPACT
======

A malicious domain, given access to a device which bus mastering
capable, can mount a denial of service attack affecting the whole
system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen version 4.0 onwards is vulnerable.

Only systems using Intel VT-d for PCI passthrough are vulnerable.

Any domain which is given access to a PCI device that is bus mastering
capable can take advantage of this vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

This issue can be avoided by not assigning PCI devices to untrusted
guests.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
