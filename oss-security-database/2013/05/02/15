I routinely do this.  It's called a key-signing party.  The only trust
that I am expressing with that signature is that I have seen and verified,
to the best of my ability, some form of reliable identification for that
person (ideally a passport I can verify, or a social environment in which
it would be very difficult to impersonate someone you are not) in
combination with a proof that the key I signed belongs to the person whose
identification I checked.

Just because someone attended a key-signing party doesn't mean that I
would, say, trust them to install software on my system.
