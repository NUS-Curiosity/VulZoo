Though for many open source projects, having a passport or other government
id is not the sort of identity we care about - knowing that you're the
person who does git/hg commits under that e-mail address is what we care
about - if it's a pseudonym that doesn't match your passport, that doesn't
affect whether we accept code from you or not.   (The lawyers might care,
when it comes to verifying who owns copyright and agreed to release code
under a given license, but that's a whole separate mess to unravel.)
