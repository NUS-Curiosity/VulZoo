For future reference you can get CVEs privately, although if you're
not the official upstream this means there is a greater chance of
duplicates (and thus of me saying "no, make a public request). So if
you want to do this a possible compromise is to email me and the
upstream and if upstream replies that it's ok then I'd probably go ahead.

Agreed, generally with public source code commits fixing an issue we
consider it public and in general I would assign a CVE publicly,
otherwise it gets to complicated to track/ensure embargoes/etc.
