There are surely differences in other parts of python code, but in this
case, affected functionality is the same in python 3 and
python-backports-ssl_match_hostname (the latter just contains a
functionality copied from the former).  Given that affected code is
identical, I don't believe differences in other parts of codebases not
related to the flaw should force split.  I.e. I'd follow:

AB4) If there are multiple products, vendors, distributors, or users of
the same core codebase, then DO NOT SPLIT based solely on
distinguishing between products.

Additionally, the same code was also found embedded elsewhere:

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=709066#16
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=963260#c11

I don't think we want to give every project embedding that source a
separate CVE id.
