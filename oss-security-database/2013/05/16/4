If you think you find a CVE worthy flaw in the Linux kernel please let
me know and I can get it a CVE asap. Same goes for most anything Open
Source. If I'm away email secalert@...hat.com and someone else on the
SRT team will attend to the CVE request.

We (Red Hat SRT) really, really like giving CVEs to issues, it makes
life so much easier for all concerned. We'd rather deal with a false
positive than miss something (like this one sort of got missed a bit =(.
