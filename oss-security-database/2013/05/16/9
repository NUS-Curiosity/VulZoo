Subject: CVE-2013-1962 libvirt: DoS (max count of open files exhaustion) due
 sockets leak in the storage pool

A denial of service flaw was found in the way storage pool manager of
libvirt, a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of
recent versions of Linux (and other OSes), performed management of
socket file descriptors when 'to list all volumes for the particular
pool' request was issued (two socket file descriptors were leaked per
"list all pool volumes" request). An uprivileged user could use this
flaw to cause denial of service (make libvirtd daemon to exhaust / reach
the maximum count of open file descriptors, the libvirtd daemon process
was allowed to open, possibly preventing other users from use of
libvirtd services till the libvirtd daemon was restarted).
