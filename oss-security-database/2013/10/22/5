Subject: CVE Request: MantisBT before 1.2.16 XSS vulnerability

Greetings

Roland Becker (MantisBT developer) discovered and fixed [1] an XSS 
vulnerability issue affecting MantisBT releases 1.0.0 to 1.2.15 included.

Account_sponsor_page.php.php did not correctly sanitize project names, 
enabling a malicious user to execute malicious JavaScript when visiting 
that page.

The criticality of this issue is compounded by the fact that a 
high-privilege account (typically project manager or administrator) is 
required to edit project names.

Patches attached to [1]. Can you please assign a CVE ID to this issue ?

Thank you
