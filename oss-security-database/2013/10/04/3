I am very much surprised that Flask is not mentioned at all in your 
e-mail. Its default session handler uses only signed cookies, and they 
can't even change the default because they don't have the DB layer or 
any other persistent storage out of the box.

Flask site is down at the moment, so no link to the documentation. But 
the problem is known, see this link for example:
