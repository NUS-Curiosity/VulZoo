Thanks, glad to see I didn't botch the request. I am correct in
thinking Mitre will fill the details (e.g. description and references)
once they get around to it, or does that require something from my or
upstream's end?

For completeness sake, upstream fixed it [1] and announced a new
release (0.9.1 [2]).
