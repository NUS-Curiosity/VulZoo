I don't know if we can realistically assign a CVE number to bad advice
on the Internet :) , but it would be immensely useful if this paragraph
could be updated to say:

   "Do not store cleartext passwords in your database. If your computer
   becomes compromised, the intruder can take the full list of
   passwords and use them. Instead, use PBKDF2, bcrypt, or scrypt to
   compute unique hash values suitable for storing in the database."

A further change that might be nice would change "If your computer becomes
compromised ..." to "When your computer becomes compromised ..." but I
could understand if the MySQL team doesn't share my pessimism and choses
to ignore this small change.

But please, MySQL team, feel free to use my proposed paragraph under
whatever license you wish. The old one has to go.

Thanks
