At least at the moment, those numbers seem very high. From our
perspective, the minimum required number of users is approximately 2.
The closed issues page is sufficient:

  https://github.com/leonnnn/pyxtrlock/issues?page=1&state=closed

Situations in which MITRE has previously declined a CVE are much more
marginal; for example:

  - some cases of code that wasn't packaged in any way, and not even
    necessarily intended for use as-is, e.g., something similar to
    example code posted as a stackoverflow.com answer

  - people a few years ago who were creating fake products that didn't
    have any reasonable purpose, and then asking for CVEs in order to
    have inbound links to their "vendor" web site
