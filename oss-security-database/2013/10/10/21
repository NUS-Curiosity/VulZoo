Subject: libtar: missing validation of file names

is this also CVE-worthy?

https://lists.feep.net:8080/pipermail/libtar/2013-October/000359.html

> The functions tar_extract_glob and tar_extract_all accept a path prefix
> on where to extract files to. However, libtar does not validate the file
> names stored inside a tar file, possibly leading to a file extraction
> outside the prefix path. For example, consider a file name
> "../../etc/passwd". If extract_all is called with prefix "/home/USER/",
> libtar would try to overwrite "/etc/passwd".


not fixed yet:

> Once I figure out the right way of handling this, there will probably be
> another libtar release.
