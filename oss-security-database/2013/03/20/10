 Ruby CVEs

I agree that oss-security is not just for CVE requests (although that's what it feels like sometimes), but duplicate CVEs are a pain for everybody.  When posting to oss-security, it's reasonable to say whether CVEs have already been requested or not.  There is not a well-established infrastructure or communication channel to closely coordinate CVE assignments between MITRE and Kurt.
