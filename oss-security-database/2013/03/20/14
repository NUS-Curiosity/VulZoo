Subject: RE: [Red Hat - Possible Forgery] Re: Ruby CVEs

http://direct.osvdb.org/show/osvdb/91450 (command_wrap gem) did not get any separate CVEs from MITRE, so the original assignment of CVE-2013-1875 is still valid.

We have REJECTed CVE-2013-1876, CVE-2013-1877, and CVE-2013-1878 as originally stated by Kurt.
