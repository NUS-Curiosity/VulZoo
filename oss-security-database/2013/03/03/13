That's where I noticed it and submitted a bugreport to
Debian BTS from there.

Note that I didn't want to request a CVE# for that, and used a
somewhat low severify value for the report in the Debian BTS
(which was quite some time after the initial report).

If I thought it deserves a CVE, I'd request one right after
seeing the discussion in question :)

But I guess we're muddling waters for too much already.  I
merely commented on the joke about Debian, -- the issue is
definitely not debian-specific, Debian does not even use
mdev from busybox (but allows to use it to the users).

Thanks,
