Subject: CVE Request: MD5 used for Download verification

I'd like to request CVE(s?) for the Python software: setuptools[1] and distribute[2]

Setuptools (and it's fork distribute) utilize MD5 in order to verify that a download has not been tampered with. 

As far as I know this affects all versions of both setuptools and distribute. 

It also affects zc.buildout[3] which utilizes the md5 checking from distribute. It does not affect pip[4] as pip has grown it's own handling code outside of setuptools/distribute to allow stronger hashes.

[2] https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute/0.6.35
[3] https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout/2.0.1
[4] https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/1.3.1
