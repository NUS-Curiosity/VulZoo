Thanks for doing this.

You know why we will not do that, sorry.

We don't usually have "days" before things are committed.  We find out
about a problem, we make up a fix, and it is committed.  Usually all
within 1-2 days.  Sometimes things take longer to fix, but usually it's
prettty fast.

As far as I am concerned, I trust linux-distros to manage this in a sane
and proper manner, and they can notify the world when they decide to do
so.  If that trust is somehow broken, we can revisit the issue in the
future.
