Nice. :)

The good news is that getting userns on 3.8 looks hard (if you build any of
the blacklisted filesystems). The bad news is that this is all fixed on 3.9
so userns is available there easily.

Regardless, on 3.9 it seems to need an explicit uid mapping to get set
up. Once that was added to your PoC, it worked for me on 3.9 too.

Also note that if hardlink restrictions were enabled by default, this
exploit would be blocked:
[-] link: Operation not permitted

I sure hope any distro shipping modern kernels is shipping with these
sysctl settings:
fs.protected_symlinks=1
fs.protected_hardlinks=1
