Subject: Re: handling of Linux kernel vulnerabilities

Hi list. I work for a sub-vendor who ships one of the major distros as
part of an appliance. Just thought I'd chip in with my €0.02.

Writing and testing an exploit for a "usable" security issue takes all of
an hour or two. Coming up with a proper patch, testing it, packaging it
and releasing it to users takes at least a week, and I personally think
that's erring optimistically.

For parts of a system that really *can't* be disabled without making the
system completely unusable (kernel, glibc and to some extent ssh tools),
I think a longer shush-time than "time of commit" is suitable for full
disclosure announcement. Note "announcement" here. People who're really
interested can ofcourse see in the patch and commit-message how the bug
can be triggered.

Otoh, where workarounds can be applied that prevent the bug from happening
the issue, I believe protection information should be released immediately.
Writing exploits (or test-cases) from workaround information is a *lot*
harder than from full disclosure listings.

Considering the successes of the wars on alcohol, poverty, drugs and
terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
