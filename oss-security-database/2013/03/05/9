Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel: xfs: _xfs_buf_find NULL pointer
 dereference

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with support for XFS file system is vulnerable to a NULL
pointer dereference flaw. This occurs while accessing blocks beyond the end
of the file system, possibly on a corrupted device.

A user able to mount the file system could use this flaw to crash the kernel, 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:
-------------
  -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/eb178619f930fa2ba2348de332a1ff1c66a31424
