Are you suggesting to create a new ID system for security bugs in
parallel with CVE that focuses on Linux kernel? As you say, such ID
system already exists -- the commit hashes. What we really need is a
(consistent) way of mapping them to CVE, which is the de-facto
standard for security vulnerabilities tracking.

I'm just wondering what would happen if Mathias sent one email per issue
and possibly with some arbitrary delay. My guess is that all of the
issues would get separate CVE.

Now Mathias sent them as a batch -- should the way of informing the CNA
affect the way CVEs are assigned?

Other than the inconsistency, I think per-subsystem SPLITs for batch
submissions are workable.
