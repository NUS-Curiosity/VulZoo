I heard my name being mentioned. I used to do all that background work but
I can't afford to do this full-time anymore. It's not easy but definitely
do-able. It can be rather tiring too. Someone needs to be proactive, and
make this happen. Petr has worked with me for a few years, and I think he
can do this.

I also want to bring back my cve-tagged kernel tree. I'm willing to work
with any distro's security team who is willing to supply me with the CVE
names, and the relevant commits/references. Talk to me if you are
interested...
