I might have been not clear, but I was merely speaking of *already
known* security issues, not “to be classified (or not)” ones. I do know
classification is hard, but if I understand correctly:

- there are issues which are known to be security ones at commit times
- some of them have been sent before to security@k.o
- some of them have not because subsystems maintainers don't want (like
networking) to go through that alias (why?)

I was merely speaking of those latter issues.
