Subject: CVE request: almanah does not encrypt its database

Could a CVE be assigned to the following?


It was reported that Almanah does not encrypt its database when it
closes, due to GApplication no longer using the quit_main_loop() event
since GIO 2.32.  This will keep the database unencrypted when it should
be encrypted.  The upstream bug report has a patch attached which
corrects the issue.
