Subject: CVE request: ibutils improper use of files in /tmp

It was reported on full-disclosure that ibutils suffers from improper
use of files /tmp that could allow a user to clobber files as the user
running ibutils (probably usually root).

I didn't see a CVE request for this or anything show up here; if one
hasn't been assigned, could it be?

Thanks.
