Subject: CVE Request -- roundcubemail: Local file inclusion via web UI
 modification of certain config options

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  RoundCube Webmail upstream has released 0.8.6 and 0.7.3
versions to correct one security flaw:

A local file inclusion flaw was found in the way RoundCube
Webmail, a browser-based multilingual IMAP client, performed
validation of the 'generic_message_footer' value provided via
web user interface in certain circumstances. A remote attacker
could issue a specially-crafted request that, when processed
by RoundCube Webmail could allow an attacker to obtain arbitrary
file on the system, accessible with the privileges of the user
running RoundCube Webmail client.
