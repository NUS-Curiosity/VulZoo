It makes sense for you to post a summary of the relevant ones of your
updates to http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/tools to
kernel-hardening after this discussion thread on oss-security is mostly
over.  Other than that, I think it's best to keep the thread on
oss-security only.  Cross-posting all or almost all of it is a mess.

(Hopefully, this is the last cross-post I have to make in this thread.)

Thanks!
