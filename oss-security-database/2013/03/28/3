sparse works similarly to clang. It was hacked up by the kernel folks
for finding potential errors in the linux kernel.

I like it particularly because it has very few false positives, unlike
most other tools I've tried. That means it's actually viable to strive
for "no warnings" from it and run it as part of automated testsuites.

terror, I think we should give some serious thought to declaring war
on peace.
