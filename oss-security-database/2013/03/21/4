Subject: CVE-2012-5662 x3270 improper validation of SSL certificates

Hi,

Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team reported that x3270
did not properly validate SSL certificates. When connecting to a host
that has a mismatched hostname in the certificate, x3270 does not warn
that there is a problem with the certificate.

For x3270 versions that implemented SSL certificate verification, but
did not properly handle the mismatched hostname case (e.g. the 3.3.12
series prior to 3.3.12ga12), this has been assigned CVE-2012-5662.

Please note that CVE-2012-5662 should not be used for older x3270
versions that supported SSL, but did not implement any kind of
certificate verification at all. No CVE identifier has been assigned to
this problem.

Version 3.3.12ga12, which fixes this issue, is available via the
project's SourceForge page [1].

In the new code, host certificate checking is turned off. To turn it
on, add '-verifycert' to the command line. The checks will include the
hostname.
