I think this is wrong.  I would understand if those issues were all in
the same subsystem at least (or if you assigned per-subsystem CVE IDs
for these), but this is not the case.  Many distros will fix some, but
not the others, or not all at the same time.  There's room for a little
bit of bundling here, but not that much.
