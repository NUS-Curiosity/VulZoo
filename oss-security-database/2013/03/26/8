Short update.

bp-code-snippets fixed in version 2.1
cleeng fixed in version 2.3.3
paypal-digital-goods-monetization-powered-by-cleeng fixed in version 2.2.14
tiny-url fixed in version 1.3.4
wp-clone-by-wp-academy fixed in version 2.1.2

Is this information something that list wants to receive in future? At least
this gives some idea of the response time from plugin developers. Some haven't
done anything yet.
