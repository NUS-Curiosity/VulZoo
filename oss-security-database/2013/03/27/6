Hi,

Guys, can we continue this thread on oss-security only, please?  It is a
topic for oss-security, but less so for kernel-hardening.  Anyone on
kernel-hardening who is interested in this topic should join oss-security.

Just drop kernel-hardening from further replies.

Clang and very recent GCC also have dynamic "sanitizers":

http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html
http://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html

Thanks,

Alexander
