Subject: Security vulnerability tools

Hi,

I'd like to get a better understanding of tools used in the open source 
community (kernel and user space) to detect security vulnerabilities.

I have a list below to get started.  If anyone has any input, I'd 
appreciate it!

I'll plan on updating http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/tools with 
anything it doesn't already have.

pscan

detecting potential security problems in a wide range of languages.

drivers, file system modules, etc
