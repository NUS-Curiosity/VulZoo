Subject: CVE Request -- yum: Not removing bad metadata and using it in next
 run

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  A security flaw was found in the way Yum package manager
performed management of repository metadata in certain
circumstances (bad metadata were not removed properly
and re-used in subsequent run). An attacker could inject
a specially-crafted Trojan horse file in the metadata of
a remote repository, possibly leading to their ability
to confuse Yum package manager to accept invalid untrusted
metadata as valid by mistake.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

P.S.: For those possibly wondering why [2] and [3]
      are public already - it's true this has been fixed
      some time ago already (but I wasn't around at that time)
      and better to request later, than never.

      Thank you for your understanding, Jan.
