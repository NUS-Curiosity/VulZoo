Subject: CVE Request: xorg-server and pixman


Hi,

This bug has been public since August but I could find a CVE for it:
https://launchpad.net/bugs/1197921

There are two bugs - Xorg can be made to crash and pixman can trigger the
aformentioned Xorg crash. A simplified reproducer is in the pixman patches with
another reproducer in the Launchpad bug. The xorg

xorg-server - exa: only draw valid trapezoids
The patch was submitted in October but doesn't seem to be applied yet, so I'm
CC'ing xorg_security. Patch references the pixman f.d.o bug, but doesn't seem to
have an associated xorg bug.
