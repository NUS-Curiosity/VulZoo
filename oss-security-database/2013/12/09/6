Subject: CVE request: monitorix: HTTP server 'handle_request()' session fixation
 & XSS vulnerabilities

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1038071

Monitorix, an open source system monitoring tool, was found to be 
vulnerable to two XSS vulnerabilities, which could allow attackers to 
execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser in the context of the 
Web server process, access sensitive data, or hijack a user's session.

The issue is that the built-in HTTP server failed to adequately sanitize 
request strings of malicious JavaScript. So by leveraging this issue, an 
attacker may be able to inject arbitrary cookies. The same issue could 
also cause arbitrary HTML and script code to be executed in a user's 
browser within the security context of the affected site. Input passed 
via requests to the "handle_request()" function (lib/HTTPServer.pm) is 
not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be 
exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser 
session in context of an affected site.

Can a CVE be assigned to this issue?
