Subject: CVE request: pam: password hashes aren't compared case-sensitively

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1038555

It was found that in pam_userdb module for Pam, password hashes weren't 
compared case-sensitively, which could lead to acceptance of hashes for 
completely different passwords, which shouldn't be accepted.

After hashing the user's password with crypt(), pam_userdb compares the 
result to the stored hash case-insensitively with strncasecmp(), which 
should be avoided, as it could result in an increased possibility of a 
successful brute-force attack.

Can a CVE be assigned for this?
