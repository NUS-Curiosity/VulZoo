Subject: possible CVE request for rpath issues fixed via slackware updates

Hello,

Some recent slackware updates fixed some rpath issues:

llvm: http://www.linuxsecurity.com/content/view/160596?rdf

libiodbc: http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2013/Dec/93

I do not have any further details, other than the llvm one may be from 2001:

http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/sys-devel/llvm/files/llvm-3.3-insecure-rpath.patch?view=diff&r1=text&tr1=1.1&r2=text&tr2=1.1&diff_format=f

Both issues possibly due to Slackware using /tmp/ for building (not
saying they do, just guessing), whereas on Fedora etc, /builddir/ is used.

Are CVEs needed (if not already assigned)?

Thanks,
