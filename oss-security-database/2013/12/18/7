There is a CVE assigned to this, but based on what Sebastian wrote, I can’t tell if it’s the same issue so I’m hesitant to say what the CVE is in case it does end up being different.

Sebastian, can you give me access to your bug?  Or did you intend to make it public?  I’m assuming that since you are asking about a CVE here, you maybe did not mean to keep it private?  Your other message said your bug contained upstream URLs (so maybe even pasting those here would be helpful).

Once I can look at it, I can let you know for sure whether or not it is the same issue (and should then use the same CVE).

Thanks.
