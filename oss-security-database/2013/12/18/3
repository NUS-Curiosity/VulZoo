Subject: CVE Request: pywbem certificate TOCTOU

Hi

There is an issue with pywbem checking x509 certifcates.
Our BZ is

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=856108

It contains the upstream URLs. There also seems to be a ticket
open for it at RH (1026891) but I cannot access that, so I dont know
whether they already assigned a CVE for it? At least in upstream commits
there is no CVE mentioned.

If there is not already one, can you assign one?

thx,
Sebastian
