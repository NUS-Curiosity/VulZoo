Hi all,

Are these followup postings still on topic for oss-security, or should
this possibly be discussed elsewhere and, if necessary and when ready,
summarized for/on oss-security as well (e.g., in the form of a revised
security advisory)?  I am not sure, and as a co-moderator I am wondering
if/when we should start rejecting messages in this thread that are CC'ed
to oss-security by non-subscribers.  I'd appreciate advice.

This is actually part of a more generic issue: whenever an upstream
project posts a security advisory CC'ed to that project's list(s) and to
oss-security, we often end up getting followup postings by users of the
project's software who are not into security and thus comment on
non-security aspects.  This is sometimes fine and maybe even desirable,
but sometimes it gets too far off topic for oss-security, and it's often
difficult for moderators to decide when to start rejecting.  A better
approach may be for upstream projects to be sending such announcements
to their lists and to oss-security separately, not by CC'ing.
(I actually asked OpenStack to start doing that a while ago, and I guess
they're doing it that way now.)
