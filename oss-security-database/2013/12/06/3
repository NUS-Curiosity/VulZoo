Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel: net: fib: fib6_add: potential NULL pointer
 dereference

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with the IPv6 protocol(CONFIG_IPv6) along with the IPv6 
source address based routing support(CONFIG_IPV6_SUBTREE) is vulnerable to a 
NULL pointer dereference flaw. It could occur while doing an ioctl(SIOCADDRT) 
call on an IPv6 socket. User would need to have CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to 
perform such a call.

A user/program with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges could use this flaw to crash a
system resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:
-------------
  -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/ae7b4e1f213aa659aedf9c6ecad0bf5f0476e1e2

Reference:

Thank you.
