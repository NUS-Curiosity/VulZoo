3)
Vulnerability Type: Insecure Unserialize
Affected Versions: Versions from 4.5.0 to 4.5.31, 4.7.0 to 4.7.16, 6.0.0 to
6.0.11, 6.1.0 to 6.1.6 and the development branch of 6.2
Severity: Medium
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:P/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
Problem Description: Due to a missing signature for an input parameter an
attacker could unserialize arbitrary objects within TYPO3. We are aware of a
working exploit which can be used to delete arbitrary files which are writable
for the PHP server process. A valid backend user login or a successful
Cross-Site Request Forgery attack are required to exploit this vulnerability.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.32, 4.7.17, 6.0.12 or 6.1.7 that fix
the problem described.
Credits: Credits go to Rupert Germann who discovered and reported the issue. 

Vulnerable subcomponent: Extension Manager
4)
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting
Affected Versions: Versions 4.5.0 to 4.5.31 and 4.7.0 to 4.7.16
Severity: Low
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
Problem Description: Failing to properly encode user input, the extension
manager is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting. To exploit this vulnerability,
attackers could trick authenticated administrators to follow a forged URL which
executes injected JavaScript on behalf of the administrator.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.32 or 4.7.17 that fix the problem
described.
Credits: Credits go to Steffen Müller who discovered and reported the issue.

Vulnerable subcomponent: Backend User Administration

Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting
Affected Versions: Versions 6.0.0 to 6.0.11, 6.1.0 to 6.1.6 and the development
branch of 6.2
Severity: Low
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
Problem Description: Failing to properly encode user input, the Backend User
Administration Module is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting. To exploit this
vulnerability, attackers could trick authenticated administrators to follow a
forged URL which executes injected JavaScript on behalf of the administrator.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 6.0.12 or 6.1.7 that fix the problem
described.
Credits: Credits go to Sebastian Nerz and Security Team member Georg Ringer who
discovered and reported the issues. 

Vulnerable subcomponent: Extbase
6)
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting
Affected Versions: Versions from 4.5.0 to 4.5.31, 4.7.0 to 4.7.16, 6.0.0 to
6.0.11, 6.1.0 to 6.1.6 and the development branch of 6.2
Severity: Medium
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:H/RL:O/RC:C
Problem Description: The errorAction method in the ActionController base class
of Extbase returns error messages without properly encoding them. Because these
error messages can contain user input, this could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerability in Extbase Framework driven TYPO3 extensions. For this
vulnerability to exploited the following conditions must be fulfilled:
- An Extbase extension must be installed and be available as plugin or module.
- The plugin or module must have the Rewritten Property Mapper enabled.
- The errorAction has not been overridden in the controller subclass in a way
  that removes error messages from the return values.

Although we are not aware of any possibility to exploit this issue with the old
property mapper or the Extbase version that has been delivered with TYPO3 4.5.x,
we removed potentially offending output from these versions as well.
Hint: If you have customized the errorAction in your Extbase extension which
have controller classes that override the error action,we advice you to check
that the error messages returned in these actions only contain static strings
and are not derived from any kind of user input. If you are not sure whether
your code is fine in that regard, feel free to ask on a public mailing list or
the forum.
Important: We have received reports that this issue has been actively exploited
in the wild.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.32, 4.7.17, 6.0.12 or 6.1.7 that fix
the problem described.
Note: The same problem applies to the TYPO3 Flow Framework.The according
advisory is: TYPO3-FLOW-SA-2013-001

Vulnerable subcomponent: OpenID Extension
7)
Vulnerability Type: Open Redirection
Affected Versions: Versions from 4.5.0 to 4.5.31, 4.7.0 to 4.7.16, 6.0.0 to
6.0.11, 6.1.0 to 6.1.6 and the development branch of 6.2
Severity: Low
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
Problem Description: Failing to validate user-provided input, the openid
extension allows redirects to arbitrary URLs. For this vulnerability to exist,
the openid extension must be installed.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.32, 4.7.17, 6.0.12 or 6.1.7 that fix
the problem described.
Credits: Credits go to Security Team member Georg Ringer who discovered and
reported the issue. 

Vulnerable subcomponent: Extension table administration library
8)
Vulnerability Type: Mass Assignment
Affected Versions: Versions from 4.5.0 to 4.5.31, 4.7.0 to 4.7.16 and 6.0.0 to
6.0.11
Severity: Medium
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
Problem Description: Extensions that make use of the feuser_adminLib.inc library
to create records are susceptible to Mass Assignment. This means that any links
for creating records generated by this library can be manipulated to fill any
field in the configured database table with arbitrary values. An attack is not
limited to the fields listed in the configuration or the link itself. This
library has been deprecated and removed from TYPO3 versions 6.1 and later but we
still decided to fix this issue in previous versions.
Hint: Extension authors are highly encouraged not to use this deprecated library
anymore.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.32, 4.7.17 or 6.0.12 that fix the
problem described.
Credits: Credits go to Bernhard Kraft who discovered and reported the issue. 

Vulnerable subcomponent: (Old) Form Content Element
9)
Vulnerability Type: Information Disclosure potentially leading to Privilege
Escalation
Affected Versions: Versions from 4.5.0 to 4.5.31, 4.7.0 to 4.7.16, 6.0.0 to
6.0.11, 6.1.0 to 6.1.6 and the development branch of 6.2
Severity: Low
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C
Problem Description: Editors that have access to the (old) form content element
were able to generate arbitrary signatures (HMACs) that could be used in
contexts which the editor should not have access to. As a precaution we changed
the generation of the signature in a way to prevent usage in a different
context.
Note: The old form content element is used by TYPO3 if the delivered extension
"form" is not active.
Solution: Update to the TYPO3 version 4.5.32, 4.7.17, 6.0.12 or 6.1.7 that fix
the problem described.
Credits: Credits go to Security Team member Franz Jahn who discovered and
reported the issue. 

10)
ID: TYPO3-FLOW-SA-2013-001
Component Type: TYPO3 Flow
Affected Versions: 1.1.0, 2.0.0 and current development branch.
Release Date: December 10, 2013
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting
Severity: Medium
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N/E:H/RL:O/RC:C
Problem Description: The errorAction method in the ActionController base class
of Flow returns error messages without properly encoding them. Because these
error messages can contain user input, this could lead to a Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerability in Flow driven applications.
Hint: If you have customized the error action in your Flow application, we
advice you to check that the error messages returned in these actions only
contain static strings and are not derived from any kind of user input. If you
are not sure whether your code is fine in that regard, feel free to ask on a
public mailing list or the forum.
Solution: Update to Flow Versions 1.1.1 or 2.0.1 which fix the problem
described!
Note: The same problem applies to the Extbase Framework in TYPO3. Read the
according advisory TYPO3-CORE-SA-2013-004 for more information. 

Same issue like in "Vulnerable subcomponent: Extbase", because Extbase (part of
TYPO3 CMS) is a backport of TYPO3 Flow. So oth products are affected by the same
bug. In my opinion this requires own CVE as there is different codebase.
