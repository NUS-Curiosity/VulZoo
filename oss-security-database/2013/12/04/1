Subject: Duplicate OpenStack CVEs for Horizon?


Hi,

I was looking at https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/+bug/1247675 and it looks like
upstream Horizon got CVE-2013-6406 assigned (referenced in the bug).

http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=730752 also references this
Launchpad bug, but does not reference a CVE.

Secunia http://secunia.com/advisories/55770 references CVE-2013-6406.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-6858 references the
Launchpad bug and the Secunia advisory, but has a different CVE. The only
reference I found to CVE-2013-6858 was the RedHat bug.

Is CVE-2013-6858 simply a duplicate of CVE-2013-6406 or were these supposed to
be split out for some reason?

Thanks
