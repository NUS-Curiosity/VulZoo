> OpenStack swift:

> os.environ['PYTHON_EGG_CACHE'] = '/tmp'

This message seems to disclose a vulnerability in an unspecified
version of OpenStack Swift. It might be the same as this part of the
http://tarballs.openstack.org/swift/swift-1.11.0.tar.gz distribution:

swift/common/manager.py

  def setup_env():
  ...
  os.environ.setdefault('PYTHON_EGG_CACHE', '/tmp')

http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/swift/tree/swift/common/manager.py

http://www.openstack.org/projects/openstack-security/ says "How to
Report Security Issues to OpenStack ... Open a bug in Launchpad and
mark it as a 'security bug'. This will make the bug Private and only
accessible to the Vulnerability Management Team." We don't know
whether that has been done. It may be inapplicable because the
information isn't private.

Use CVE-2013-7109 for this report about OpenStack Swift. Again,
CVE-2013-7109 is not an ID for which setuptools is the affected
product.

> Google search:
> 
> PYTHON_EGG_CACHE "/tmp" filetype:py

This seems very useful, but it's not a type of information that MITRE
is interested in working with at this exact moment. At first glance,
the Google search results seem to include all of the following:

  - cases in which something equivalent to
    "os.environ.setdefault('PYTHON_EGG_CACHE', '/tmp')" is used within
    code that's intended for distribution as a "product"

  - cases in which something equivalent to
    "os.environ.setdefault('PYTHON_EGG_CACHE', '/tmp')" is used within
    other types of code such as site-specific code or example code

  - cases in which setting PYTHON_EGG_CACHE would not actually occur
    (comments, documentation, discussion, etc.)

We can assign CVE IDs for the first category, i.e., cases in which
someone has identified this as a security problem within a specific
software product.
