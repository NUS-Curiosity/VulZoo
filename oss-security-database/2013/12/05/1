Subject: CVE needed for hplip insecure auto update feature?

Hello,

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=853405 talks about an
upgrade feature in hplip downloading (via HTTP) a binary and executing
it. Is a CVE needed for that?

Along with the versions in
<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=853405#c6>, the hplip 1.6.7
and hplip3 3.9.8 versions I looked at did not have the upgrade.py file
in the source (newer version like 3.13.11 had it in the source but the
RPM spec file looks to remove it at build time, so it is not provided in
the binary RPMs).

Thanks,
