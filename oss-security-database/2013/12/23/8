Subject: Re: CVE Request: gitolite world writable files for fresh installs of v3.5.3

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

>> Brief description (main points of announcement): Fresh installs

Use CVE-2013-7203 for this issue that affects additional older
versions of gitolite that were not affected by CVE-2013-4451.

> altough different versions are affected, if I understand it correctly
> both fall under CWE-276

The different-versions observation is what makes it necessary to have
separate CVE IDs.
