Subject: CVE request: denial of service in Nagios (process_cgivars())

Could a CVE be assigned to the following flaw?

A flaw was reported and fixed in Nagios, which can be exploited to cause a denial of service.  This vulnerability is caused due to an off-by-one error within the process_cgivars() function, which can be exploited to cause an out-of-bounds read by sending a specially-crafted key value to the Nagios web UI.
