Further note, for example:

A default account/password in a device or service. Is this a security
issue or not? Different scenarios have different outcomes:

1) The default account/password is well documented. The services
forces you to change the password when first run and will refuse to
run until you do change the password. Generally not considered a vuln.

2) The default account/password is well documented. The services does
not force you to change the password when first run. Generally not
considered a vuln as it falls into the "don't do stupid things" class
of issues.

3) The default account/password is not well documented or not
documented at all but can be changed. Generally this would be
considered a vulnerability.

4) The default account/password is not well documented or not
documented at all and can NOT be changed. Generally this would be
considered a vulnerability.

Similar things for other things, is it a security vulnerability or
security hardening, or not a security issue at all? It definitely gets
fuzzy/messy sometimes.
