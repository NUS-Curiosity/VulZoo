Subject: CVE request: WordPress 3.5.1 Maintenance and Security Release

>From http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/

WordPress 3.5.1 also addresses the following security issues:

- A server-side request forgery vulnerability and remote port scanning using pingbacks. This vulnerability, which could potentially be used to expose information and compromise a site, affects all previous WordPress versions. This was fixed by the WordPress security team. Weâ€™d like to thank security researchers Gennady Kovshenin and Ryan Dewhurst for reviewing our work.
- Two instances of cross-site scripting via shortcodes and post content. These issues were discovered by Jon Cave of the WordPress security team.
- A cross-site scripting vulnerability in the external library Plupload. Thanks to the Moxiecode team for working with us on this, and for releasing Plupload 1.5.5 to address this issue.
