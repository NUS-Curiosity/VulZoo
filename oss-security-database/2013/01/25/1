So to be clear: haproxy fails to properly drop group privileges. Why
isn't this classified as a security vulnerability?

Well there is no way to exploit this that we're aware of, if you know
a way to exploit this please let us know.

What would make this a security vulnerability? Let's say for example
haproxy had an option to read or write to a file and did this with the
privileges it failed to drop (granting the attacker privilege
escalation) then it would be a security vulnerability.

So again, if you know of a way to exploit this please let us know,
otherwise we will continue to consider this a security hardening issue
and not a security vulnerability.

So as for this tweet:

"@chort0 http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2013/q1/174 â€¦ I didn't know about
that claim -- I guess it explains why such great effort was made to
not call it a vuln"

I wasn't aware of this claim by haproxy and to be honest I don't care.
I assigned something like 1,600 CVE's last year, trust me, I'm not
afraid to annoy people by assigning CVEs that might embarrass them.
