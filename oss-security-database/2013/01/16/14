Subject: bcron: cron jobs get access to the temporary output files from all
 other jobs that are still running

Hi

I haven't found if there was already a request for this.

In Debian Bugtracker it was closed [1] today. It is possible due to a
bug in bcron-exec that cron jobs get access to the temporary output
files from other jobs that are still running. This is also mentioned
in upstream's NEWS[2]. The commit to fix this on github should be[3].
Even it looks bcron is not broadly used, could the above get a CVE?
