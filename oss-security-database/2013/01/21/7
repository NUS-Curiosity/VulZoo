Subject: Re: CVE Request - Wordpress 3.5 Full-path disclosure vulnerability

The issue can be seen only when PHP's display_errors is set to On.
I have setup a default installation of wordpress 3.5 to display the issue.
 It can be accessed via the URL: http://blog.gilgalab.com.br/?s[]=1

Regards,

Henrique
