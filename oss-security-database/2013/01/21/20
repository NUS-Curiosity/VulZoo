Subject: CVE request for Movable Type

Hi,

Movable Type 4.38 has been released few weeks ago, fixing a security
issue in the upgrade page.

More information can be found at [1] but basically it looks like missing
input sanitation on the mt-upgrade.cgi page.

As far as I can tell, no CVE has been allocated yet, could someone
allocate one?

Regards,
