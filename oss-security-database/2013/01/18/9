The fix we added to Drupal does not require (or implement) an update
to the jQuery library at all; rather it works around the issue
entirely within Drupal's code.  I think that means it should get its
own CVE ID.

We did it this way because it means that any other Drupal packages,
such as drupal7-jquery_update, would not be expected to have a
vulnerability as long as the core update is applied.

I believe this means that yes, we will need a fourth CVE id to be allocated.

Thanks,
Greg
