Sebastian, do you have a specific command that you're using?  I'm trying
to reproduce this in Fedora and RHEL using lvdisplay (maybe a bad
choice?) and also using "lvm vgck -v vg_thor && lvm pvs" in
/etc/crontab.

The output is mailed to me fine with no warnings?  Can you share what
command was being used to reproduce this?  It's possible that something
you added (or we added) makes this a non-issue on other platforms.

Has upstream been informed of this yet?
