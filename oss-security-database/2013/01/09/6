No, we're using cronie as well.

Ok, so did some more digging based on some info from one of our
developers that we had patched this in Fedora.

Looks like this patch introduced the leak on 2011-04-28:

http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/cronie.git/commit/src/cron.c?id=acdf4ae8456888ed78201906ef528f4c28f54582

And this patch reverted it on 2011-06-29:

http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/cronie.git/commit/src/cron.c?id=b19007ca9fddd62ecef3af4a7d2d252f1d5e0419

So it looks like only 1.4.8 was affected by this (which, judging by the
patch in your bugzilla is the same version you're seeing as affected).

That might be a better patch to use than what you're using.  Anyways,
this only affects 1.4.8 (for any others using cronie and concerned as to
whether or not they might be affected).

This was also reported to our bugzilla here:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=717505
