Subject: Re: CVE Request: cronie fd leak

Hi,

Possible that you have got a different cron implementation.

There is no hidden info in our bugzilla; the reproducer
is using lvm commands, but I remember it worked with any
command. Actually its not about the warnings, a "cat" will probably
also do, if you check its /proc/$pid/fd when its invoked.
But cat doesnt emit warnings about open fd's.

Not sure about upstream, probably not.

regards,
Sebastian
