Subject: CVE request: MantisBT before 1.2.13 "Change Status To" feature
 allows unauthorised workflow changes

Hello again list,

Damien Regad (MantisBT developer) discovered and fixed[1] an access
control/permissions bug in MantisBT that exists in MantisBT version
1.2.12 and prior.

A MantisBT user with "Reporter" permissions (enabling them to
report/create new issues) can modify the workflow status of any issue to
"New" even if they do not have the necessary permission to make this
change.

Details of the bug, including steps to reproduce and patches are
available at [1].

As per previous e-mails to this list within the past 24 hours, MantisBT
1.2.13 is expected to be released early next week.

Can a CVE ID please be assigned to this issue?

With thanks,
David Hicks
MantisBT Developer
