I think the expectation was that key material is discarded on 
suspend/hibernate.  This seems quite desirable for hibernate without 
encrypted swap.

I've verified that Fedora 17 (GNOME 3.4) does not discard cached keys on 
suspend and hibernate, either.  (Swap is encrypted, though, at least I 
selected that in the installer.)  However, I suspect that users expect 
that suspend (but perhaps not hibernate) does not discard keys.
