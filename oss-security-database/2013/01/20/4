Subject: ffmpeg/libav CVE dupe

Hi,
there seems to be a dupe in the assignments for the recent
round of ffmpeg/libav security updates:

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2777
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2784

While the description states that it's a different issue,
the only actual issue is the typo in the git commit URL in
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2784

I think it makes sense to reject CVE-2012-2784.

Cheers,
        Moritz
