Subject: CVE request: hs-tls: Basic constraints vulnerability

Hi

For hs-tls (TLS/SSL implementation in haskell) it was announced the following
advisory[0]:

----cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut---------cut-----
Hi cafe,

this is a security advisory for tls-extra < 0.6.1 which are all vulnerable to bad
certificate validation.

Some part of the certificate validation procedure were missing (relying on the
work-in-progress x509 v3 extensions), and because of this anyone with a correct
end-entity certificate can issue certificate for any arbitrary domain, i.e.
acting as a CA.

This problem has been fixed in tls-extra 0.6.1, and I advise everyone to upgrade as
soon as possible.

Despite a very serious flaw in the certificate validation, I'm happy that the
code is seeing some audits, and would want to thanks Ertugrul SÃ¶ylemez for the
findings [1].

According to the upstream issue it should be fixed with commit [2].

Could a CVE for this issue be assigned?
