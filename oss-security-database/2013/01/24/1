Sorry, I should have perhaps clarified that a bit more.  That wasn't so
much to say "don't assign a CVE" as much as a "is this mitigation
sufficient".  I can see, however, how it might have been construed the
other way.

Yes, indeed, exactly like that.  =)  Although one would hope that logger
has a decent input limit where you couldn't inject a ~10MB long line
into syslog.  Regardless, what logger does or doesn't do isn't the issue
either.

Yes, absolutely.

You're right.  I'm inclined to think it isn't an issue (or at least not
one really worth filing bugs over, however that is just my personal
opinion).  I see that Kurt did indeed assign CVEs, so I'll be filing
those bugs regardless.

You, sir, have a very valid point here.  Thanks for that little
reminder.
