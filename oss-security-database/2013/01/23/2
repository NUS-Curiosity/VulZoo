>Please use CVE-2013-0209 for this issue.

We decided to keep CVE-2013-0209 instead of the other CVE that was
reserved for this through MITRE a while ago. Also, we decided to cover
this with one CVE entry even though the various issues discussed ("OS
command injection and SQL injection" in the vendor advisory, and "perl
code injection" in the researcher's advisory) can perhaps be
interpreted in other ways.
