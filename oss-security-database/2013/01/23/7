Subject: [Security hardening] [Notification] haproxy (previously) failed to
 drop supplementary groups after setuid / setgid calls properly

Hello vendors,

  just FYI notification that haproxy upstream has recently corrected [2]
improper dropping of supplementary groups [1] after setuid / setgid
calls.

We have further investigated this issue and have reasons to believe that 
by itself this is NOT a security issue (another flaw would need to be
found in haproxy this to be actually possible to use for something interesting).

For now we are considering this fix to be a preventive measure / security
hardening (but took the time to notify you explicitly about this as you might
still want to backport it into affected versions).

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
