I think the clearest part is
<https://live.gnome.org/GnomeKeyring/SecurityPhilosophy>, which
proclaims:

| * Try to keep your secrets from being swapped out or otherwise
|   written to disk.
| * Hunkering down and discarding all secrets when your computer is
|   locked.

The documentation for gnome_keyring_lock_all_sync
<http://developer.gnome.org/gnome-keyring/unstable/gnome-keyring-Keyrings.html#gnome-keyring-lock-all-sync>
says:

| Lock all the keyrings, so that their contents may not eb accessed
| without first unlocking them with a password.

In addition,
<http://developer.gnome.org/gnome-keyring/unstable/gnome-keyring-Non-pageable-Memory.html>
suggests that locked memory is never written to disk.  This is not
true with hibernation.
