Subject: CVE Request: nagios Stack based buffer overflow in web interface

Hi,

I dont know if this already got a CVE. At least its not mentioned
in the initial posting:

http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2012-12/0108.html

Our bug about this is here:

https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=797237

Can someone assign a CVE?

thx,
Sebastian
