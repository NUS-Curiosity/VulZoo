Subject: CVE request: Digest::SHA double free when using load subroutine

Hi

The following was fixed in Digest-SHA Perl module in Version 5.81:

5.81  Mon Jan 14 05:17:08 MST 2013
	- corrected load subroutine (SHA.pm) to prevent double-free
		-- Bug #82655: Security issue - segfault
		-- thanks to Victor Efimov and Nicholas Clark
			for technical expertise and suggestions

Upstream bugreport is: https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=82655

Diff: https://metacpan.org/diff/release/MSHELOR/Digest-SHA-5.80/MSHELOR/Digest-SHA-5.81

A reproducer is given in the upstream bugreport. Does this warrants a
CVE? (It's at least a DoS).

Regards,
Salvatore
