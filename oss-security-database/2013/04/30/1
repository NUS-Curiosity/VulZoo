One thing I think would help is having a 1-2 page advisory guideline,
e.g. what do we need for assigning CVE's/writing CVEs up and in
general what do the end users/etc want. I set this up as a bare

Not all fields are required. If anyone else has comments/etc please
email me and I'll see about getting this written up as a short HOWTO.
