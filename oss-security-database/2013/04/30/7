Just for the record, most OpenPGP key certification listings don't
indicate anything at all about trust, including "who trusted them".
they show cryptographically-verifiable assertions of identity and
control over key material.

Put another way, a signature on an OpenPGP key+userid says "I believe
that this key belongs to this person" -- it doesn't say anything about
trust in that person (or about their intrinsic trustworthiness).

Sorry for the nit-pick, but the term "trust" is so overused and confused
in these contexts that i think it's important to clarify it when it's
getting muddled.
