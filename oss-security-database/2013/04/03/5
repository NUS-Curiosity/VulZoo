Subject: Re: CVE Request: glibc getaddrinfo() stack overflow


glibc resolver surprisingly seems to accept indeed larger
UDP packets than DNS servers would send without EDNS0.
But depending on setup its probably hard to get such large
packets through your local recursive DNS, not to speak
about the firewall. Maybe its possible to signal truncation
and force a TCP connect?
