Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are combined in that array, right?  Then 
the protocol limit seems to be around 4000 + 2300 addresses (NAME (2 
bytes with compression) + RCLASS (2) + RTYPE(2) + TTL (4) + RDATALEN(2) 
+ RDATA(4 or 16) per record, total available space is 64K), which could 
be used to blow 128K stacks sometimes used by JVMs.
