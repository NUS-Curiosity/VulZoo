Subject: Multiple CVE requests for MantisBT

Greetings,

The following 4 issues were discovered in the Mantis Bug Tracker:


1. Close button available to users despite workflow restrictions

This issue affects Mantis 1.2.12 and later.

It allows low-privileged users to close issues even though the workflow
settings do not permit it.

2. XSS vulnerability when deleting a version

This issue affects Mantis 1.2.14 only. 

Arbitrary JavaScript could be executed in the client's browser when deleting
a version containing embedded code in its name. The criticality of this
issue is compounded by the fact that a high-privilege account (typically
project manager or administrator) is required to both to create and delete a
version.

3. XSS vulnerability on Configuration Report page

This issue affects Mantis 1.2.13 only [1]. 

If the system defines a Project containing embedded JavaScript code in its
name, that code would be executed in the client's browser when displaying
the configuration report page (adm_config_report.php).

The severity of this issue is mitigated by the need to have a
high-privileged account both to set the project's name and to access the
configuration report page.

4. XSS issue on Configuration Report page when displaying complex value

This issue affects Mantis 1.2.0rc1 and later.

Lack of proper string escaping allows users (having admin access) to enter
arbitrary javascript code and have it executed on the user's browser.

Issues resolution:

 - 1 & 2 will be fixed in upcoming release 1.2.15, expected to go live 
   sometime next week (patches are available in the referenced issues)

 - 3 & 4 were both resolved in version 1.2.14, released on 29-Jan-2013 


Could you kindly assign CVEs for the above issues ? Thanks in advance.

[1] MantisBT version 1.2.13 was tagged in the repository but never formally
released, as we discovered several critical issues at the last minute and
decided to pull it and released 1.2.14 a week later instead.
