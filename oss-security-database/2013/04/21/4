SUSE has started to adjust its spec files to help here,

1. we use full Source URLs for the download tarballs.

   This can ensure that the tarballs do not change, or if they change
   a warning can pop up.

2. We are trying GPG signature checking, in cases where parallel to the tarball
   lies a .sig or .asc file and there is a known keyring.

   started here:
   http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2012-12/msg00235.html

   In case they are provided:

   a. We refer the .sig/.asc file as with Source URL in the .spec file
   b. We store the keyring in the package sources, also as a Source (no URL)
   c. We use RPM macros to verify the gpg signature during build.

   Our source review team has to check when the keyring changes. 

This has the usual problems:
- Usage of gpg causes buildcycles if you do full transient builds of the distribution.

- Need to verify the keyring at begin and also when it changes somehow.


But yes, for upstream source providers I think it would really be nice if
they would also sign their binaries and upload the signature in parallel.

And also publish their keyring and let some keys be in the chain of trust
that could be gained from e.g. Linux fairs/conferences (LinuxTag usually
does keysigning etc.)

Savannah hosting does parts of that already, the hosting service also
offers the keyring per project.

Ciao, Marcus
