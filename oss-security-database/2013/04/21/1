We do have a project leader who is Aaron Griffin, although his role
tends to be limited to administrative things these days.  But as your
research suggested, I am in a position to appoint myself as security

I am intending to form a more official security response in Arch Linux
rather than the quite adhoc process we have at the moment.  The
information on linux-distros will be used to prepare updates to be
released at the end of relevant embargo.
