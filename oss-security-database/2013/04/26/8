Unfortunately we weren't approached by "Qihoo 360 Web Security Research Team"
before this publication went out through bugtraq.

We are now trying to obtain more information from that team without much success.

We've also analyzed their report and we can't conclude this is a real vulnerability yet.
From the descriptions provided it still looks like it's somewhat spurious.

We are trying to continue investigation though.

Regrettably responsible disclosure isn't always the case. However, we can't yet confirm
it's a full one either.
