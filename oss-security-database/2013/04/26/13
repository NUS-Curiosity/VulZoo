I wasn't aware of StartCom.  I've been using CACert, which is not
included in browsers.

My point was that browsers go to great lengths to prevent users from
visiting sites that use self-signed certificates, or certificates signed
by a CA which the browser does not know / trust, but will happily let
users submit forms on unencrypted sites without even a warning.  This is
the same "no security is better than imperfect security" logic.
