Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel: ext4: hang during mount(8)

   Hi,

Linux kernel built with an Ext4 filesystem is vulnerable to a system hang 
situation. It occurs while [auto]mounting a non-journal filesystem with an 
orphan list of inodes to clear.

A user could use this flaw to stall the kernel resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:
-------------
  -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/0e9a9a1ad619e7e987815d20262d36a2f95717ca

Reference:
----------
  -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=957123

Thank you.
