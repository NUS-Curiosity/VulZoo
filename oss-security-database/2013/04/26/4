Is this legit?

I downloaded the index.html file with curl, and embedded around line 87
was a flash file:

<table width="930" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<tr><td>
<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="/banner.swf?xml=/banner.xml" width="930" height="180">
<param name="movie" value="/banner.swf?xml=/banner.xml"/>
</object>
</td></tr>
<tr>

so I took it to be an attempt at phishing.

Maybe I'm just too paranoid in my old age?

Alistair
