Subject: re: Summary of security bugs (now fixed) in user namespaces


Andy;

: I previously reported these bugs privatley.  I'm summarizing them for
: the historical record.  These bugs were never exploitable on a
: default-configured released kernel, but some 3.8 versions are
: vulnerable depending on configuration.

Do you know if these were patched, and therefore possibly disclosed via 
the commits? With these details, it is difficult to line them up to 
existing reports.

Thanks,

Brian
