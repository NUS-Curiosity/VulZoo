Subject: New vulnerabilty in imagemagick

Hi,

Imagemagick url coder is affected by a NULL deference trigerrable by user

It only occurs when you use a URL as an image filename and you can't
write to the temporary directory which is typically /tmp or whereever
MAGICK_TMPDIR env variable points.

As the debian mainteners I believe this is a security (minor) bug that
could lead to local dos at least.

Upstream bug is here
http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=23117

Could you please open a candidate CVE number ?

Patch here fix the bug.
