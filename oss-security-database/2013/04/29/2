Subject: distros vs. linux-distros lists

Hi,

Guys, before posting to these closed lists, please take a moment to
think whether to report a given issue to distros (currently includes
FreeBSD and NetBSD, as well as all of linux-distros members) or to
linux-distros (Linux only).  Last week, Linux kernel issues were
needlessly posted to distros (yes, the ones Andy has just made public in
here), and today an issue not specific to Linux is posted to
linux-distros (should be resent to distros now, I think).

Thanks,

Alexander
