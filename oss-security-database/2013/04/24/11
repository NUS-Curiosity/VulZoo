Ultimately if we start scoring off major holidays we've have no
release dates left ;)

In general Red Hat goes by major North American statutory holidays
(many of which tend to be global, e.g. Christmas). We also do our best
to avoid North American Friday (which is Saturday in Europe/Asia) and
North American Saturday/Sunday as well. Other than that we tend to
release as needed:

and so on. Also some historical data on which weekdays/times are the
busiest:
