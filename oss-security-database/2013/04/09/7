 Vulnerable to XXE attacks

Hi Breno,

  (Cc-ing Athmane on this due reasons which will get obvious below).

  thank you for checking with us.

AFAICT to fix this in Fedora and Fedora EPEL-6 versions, we have
just rebased to latest upstream 2.7.3 version. But you are truly
right (assuming this being the reason you are checking with us),
that on Fedora EPEL-5 we are shipping older (2.6.8 based version
of ModSecurity).

FWIHL:
  [1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=947842#c1

it's wasn't immediately clear how the backported upstream patch
would look like in / against that version (and not completely
sure we can just rebase in that product too - Athmane could you
clarify here if we can rebase or would rather want upstream patch
form against 2.6.8 version?)

Breno, so if you are willing to help (and Athmane would confirm
we need patch against 2.6.8 version), it would be appreciated
if you could provide it.

That's just for our expectations. Obviously other vendors might
be interested in upstream patch backports against different versions
yet (but I will let them to speak out their needs by themselves).

Thank you for your time / check anyway. It's appreciated.

Regards, Jan.
