Subject: CVE Request: Apache Solr XXE

Hi All

Apache Solr 4.3.1, 4.4, 5.0 resolves multiple XXE flaws, as described in the following bugs:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-3895
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-4881

I have confirmed that these issues can also be exploited on Apache Solr 3.6.2. Please assign a CVE ID for these XXE flaws (I think a single CVE ID is most appropriate).

Thanks
