Subject: "I miss LSD", slides, paper and tools relating to finding UNIX system level vulnerabilities (as given at 44CON)

All,

Some of you may already have spotted this, but last night we published our 
slides, paper and some tools from my talk at 44CON earlier in the year.  The 
content can be found at:

* http://labs.portcullis.co.uk/presentations/i-miss-lsd/

The take home points around the System V shared memory issues (detailed in 
more detail in the linked to paper) are:

* System V shared memory is often created with weak permissions.
* Usage of System V shared memory by X11 applications is particularly 
problematic.
* Qt Project patched Qt APIs (CVE-2013-0254), Oracle patched Java JRE
(CVE-2013-1500), Google patched Chrome independently.
* No progress has been made on the problem more generally by either Red Hat or
Debian.
* Coccinelle is an effective tool for performing static analysis on large 
corpuses of C.
* Memory corruption attacks against System V shared memory are unlikely.

I've also released a tool called smaSHeM (again linked to) for dumping System 
V shared memory and for manipulating it.
