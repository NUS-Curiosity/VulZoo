I'll be honest, this is how I audit for tmp files:

find ./ -type f -exec grep "/tmp" {} \;

Then I look to see how those files/dirs are created, if it's anything
other than the secure ways listed here:

http://kurt.seifried.org/2012/03/14/creating-temporary-files-securely/

it's probably wrong. I can't think of any software I've looked at that
have been 100% correct (there were two that were correct in the actual
code but had tests/etc. that were insecure).
