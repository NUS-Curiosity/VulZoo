As you probably saw, I commented in your bug regarding this and now that
I've seen this I did some further digging.

The reason this doesn't crash for me on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 which
ships 1.1.17 is because we included this patch (well, the developer did)
a day after the initial build with the comment:

- CVE-2012-2825 requires an extra patch on 1.1.17

So, I think this does require a second CVE.  This also explains why I
didn't see any crashes with our updated packages because we already have
this patch.
