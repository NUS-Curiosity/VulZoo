Subject: CVE request for Drupal contributed modules

Hi there! I'd like to request CVE identifiers for:

SA-CONTRIB-2013-081 - Spaces - Access bypass
https://drupal.org/node/2118717

SA-CONTRIB-2013-082 - Bean - Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
https://drupal.org/node/2118873

SA-CONTRIB-2013-083 - Quiz - Access Bypass
https://drupal.org/node/2123995
(This appears to me to be two issues; an access bypass, and an access
bypass leading to information disclosure.)

SA-CONTRIB-2013-084 - FileField Sources - Access Bypass
https://drupal.org/node/2124241

SA-CONTRIB-2013-085 - Feed Element Mapper - Cross Site Scripting
https://drupal.org/node/2124279

SA-CONTRIB-2013-086 - Monster Menus - Access bypass
https://drupal.org/node/2124289

Thanks!
Forest
