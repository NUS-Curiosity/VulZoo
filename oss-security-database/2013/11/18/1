Subject: CVE request for Drupal contributed modules

Hi there, I'd like to request CVEs for:

SA-CONTRIB-2013-087 - Payment for Webform - Access Bypass
https://drupal.org/node/2129373

SA-CONTRIB-2013-088 - Secure Pages - Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data
https://drupal.org/node/2129381

SA-CONTRIB-2013-089 - Node Access Keys - Access Bypass
https://drupal.org/node/2129379

SA-CONTRIB-2013-090 - Revisioning - Access Bypass
https://drupal.org/node/2135257

SA-CONTRIB-2013-091 - Groups, Communities and Co (GCC) - Access Bypass

SA-CONTRIB-2013-092 - Misery - Denial of Service (DOS) vulnerability

(Says multiple, but it seems to me this is really just a single DoS vuln.)

Thanks Kurt.
