Compatibility, for example HTTPS, you can disable a lot but if you
only allowed one cipher chances are a good chunk of clients wouldn't
be able to connect. There's a LOT of software out there, some open
source, some commercial, some written in house, it all uses encryption
and signing (usually wrongly, sigh) and a lot of it cannot or will not
be updated any time soon, if at all. Think of all the devices that act
as a web client and will never have TLS 1.2 support (e.g. "smart" TVs)
for example. Would I prefer the world to ditch SSL, TLS 1.0 and 1.1
and move to TLS 1.2 entirely? Of course. Is it going to happen? Not
for a loooong time.

Think of all the things that currently use (often older versions of)
OpenSSL/PolarSSL/GnuTLS/etc and will never get updated...
