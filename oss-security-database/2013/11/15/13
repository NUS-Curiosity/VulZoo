Subject: CVE request for graphicsmagick DoS

I don't think this has been brought up here yet, but could a CVE be
provided for the following?

A vulnerability has been reported in GraphicsMagick, which can be
exploited by malicious people to 
cause a DoS (Denial of Service).

The vulnerability is caused due to an error within the
"ExportAlphaQuantumType()" function 
(magick/export.c) when exporting 8-bit RGBA images and can be exploited
to cause a crash.

The vulnerability is reported in versions prior to 1.3.18.
