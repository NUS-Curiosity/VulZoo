The Mozilla opsec guys wrote up some good guidelines recently on what
they consider a good TLS cipher suite choice should be, but even if you
didn't want to go all-out by making the default ultra-secure (with
full PFS, etc.), they explain their choices fairly well, so should be
useful in trying to figure out a middle ground that makes most people
happy.
