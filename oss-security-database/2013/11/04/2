Subject: CVE Request: IBUS showing passwords during password input

Hi,

One of our Japanese users found that some IBUS input methods
show passwords while typing them, if a special "intent" is not
provided.

The behaviour started (I think) with with IBUS 1.5.4

Fuminobu Takeyama, is this correct?

Ciao, Marcus
