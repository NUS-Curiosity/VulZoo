Subject: Re: CVE Request: IBUS showing passwords during password input

Hello,

> The behaviour started (I think) with with IBUS 1.5.4
Yes. It happens on IBus-enabled GNOME 3.6+ with IBus 1.5.4 if IBus's
engines (plug-ins) do not support new API introduced by 1.5.4.

Actually, this problem is not found by me, though.
The upstream has already announced in [1].

An IBus developer (Mr. Fuijiwara) says in [1]:
"1.5.2 or lower do not handle the input purpose so the typed chars are
shown as the bug."
So I think the same problem may happen also on GNOME 3.6 + IBus 1.5.2.
