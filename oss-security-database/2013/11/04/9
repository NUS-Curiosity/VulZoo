SSLCipherSuite HIGH:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!aNULL@...ENGTH
should be fine. There are basically near zero browsers out there that
should have any problems with that. Even dinosaurs like IE6 can work
with this, you don't need "medium" ciphers as long as you don't want to
make a site accessible to browser museums.

And looking at what medium includes that high doesn't, it seems you
really don't want that ancient cipher suites:
-DHE-RSA-SEED-SHA
-DHE-DSS-SEED-SHA
-SEED-SHA
-IDEA-CBC-SHA
-IDEA-CBC-MD5
-RC2-CBC-MD5
-ECDHE-RSA-RC4-SHA
-ECDHE-ECDSA-RC4-SHA
-ECDH-RSA-RC4-SHA
-ECDH-ECDSA-RC4-SHA
-RC4-SHA
-RC4-MD5
-RC4-MD5
-PSK-RC4-SHA
