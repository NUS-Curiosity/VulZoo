There is no difference to HIGH:!aNULL on my system. I don't see why
HIGH:!MEDIUM:!LOW could be not equal to HIGH anyway...

This is not what I get for "MEDIUM" (debian testing); I see only SEED +
RC4; RC2 is an export cipher; wikipedia has some stuff on IDEA, and it
seems indeed "ancient". SEED might be more relevant (for Korea...), and
RC4 is having a big comeback due to the BEAST attack.

I think due to BEAST a default collection should include RC4; that is
why I included MEDIUM.
