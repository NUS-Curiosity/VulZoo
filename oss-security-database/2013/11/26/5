Subject: CVE Request: static IV used in Percona XtraBackup

Hi,

This came to our desk:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=852224
https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/+bug/1185343

constant IV used in CTR Mode, allowing plaintext retrieval
attacks.

I think it needs a CVE.

Ciao, Marcus
