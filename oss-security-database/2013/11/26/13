Is suppose this is part of the fix.

+void
+xb_crypt_init_iv()
+{
+	uint seed = time(NULL);
+	srandom(seed);
+}
+
+void
+xb_crypt_create_iv(void* ivbuf, size_t ivlen)
+{
+	size_t i;
+	ulong rndval;
+
+	for (i = 0; i < ivlen; i++) {
+		if (i % 4 == 0) {
+			rndval = (ulong) random();
+		}
+		((uchar*)ivbuf)[i] = ((uchar*)&rndval)[i % 4];
+	}
+}

This still risks keystream reuse because time() is fairly coarse.

What's worse, on 64-bit big-endian architectures, it results in a 
constant zero IV because RAND_MAX is not large enough to reach the upper 
32 bits in the first four bytes of the rndval variable.
