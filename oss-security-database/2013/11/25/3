Subject: [OSSA 2013-031] Ceilometer DB2/MongoDB backend password leak (CVE-2013-6384)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-031
CVE: CVE-2013-6384
Date: November 25, 2013
Title: Ceilometer DB2/MongoDB backend password leak
Reporter: Eric Brown (IBM)
Products: Ceilometer
Affects: All supported versions

Description:
Eric Brown from IBM reported an information leak in Ceilometer logs. The
password for the DB2 or MongoDB backends was logged at INFO level in the
ceilometer-api logs. An attacker with access to the logs (local shell,
log aggregation system access, or accidental leak) may leverage this
vulnerability to elevate privileges and gain direct full access to the
Ceilometer backend. Only Ceilometer setups using the DB2 or MongoDB
backends are affected.
