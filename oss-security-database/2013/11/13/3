Subject: Microsoft Warns Customers Away From RC4 and SHA-1

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

- From Slashdot:

"The RC4 and SHA-1 algorithms have taken a lot of hits in recent
years, with new attacks popping up on a regular basis. Many security
experts and cryptographers have been recommending that vendors begin
phasing the two out, and Microsoft on Tuesday said it is now
recommending to developers that they deprecate RC4 and stop using the
SHA-1 hash algorithm. RC4 is among the older stream cipher suites in
use today, and there have been a number of practical attacks against
it, including plaintext-recovery attacks. The improvements in
computing power have made many of these attacks more feasible for
attackers, and so Microsoft is telling developers to drop RC4 from
their applications. The company also said that as of January 2016 it
will no longer will validate any code signing or root certificate that
uses SHA-1."

I'm inclined to agree. The question I suppose is, like DES (and
3DES/MD5) at what point do we start assigning CVE's for some of this?
thoughts and comments welcome.
