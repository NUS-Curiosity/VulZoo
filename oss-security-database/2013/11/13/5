It's answers like this that make it difficult for non-security-literate system administrators to make good decisions.  I completely understand and agree with what you wrote but I wonder if we're making it harder for people to understand how to protect themselves.

After having many similar conversations with people that manage systems I find that it's usually easier to say "MD5 bad, SHA-256 good" and then just walk away.  Perhaps some sort of chart should be published that allows people to make better decisions?
