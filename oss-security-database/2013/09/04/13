CVE assignment by MITRE doesn't look at flaws in quite that way. If a
vendor has developed and released software and then sends us a report
that the software had a security-relevant mistake, or violated that
vendor's intended security policy, that's usually enough for a CVE.
Reports from third parties are viewed much more restrictively.
