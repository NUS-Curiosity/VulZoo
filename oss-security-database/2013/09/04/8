Subject: CVE-2013-2185 / Tomcat

Hi,
Question to the Red Hat people on the list:

Is https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-2185 something which applies
to Tomcat in general or is this specific to the  "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise 
Application Platform"?

The DiskFileItem class is part of Tomcat 7, but there's no reference to CVE-2013-2185
at http://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html

Cheers,
        Moritz
