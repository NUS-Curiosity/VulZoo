Subject: [notification] django: CVE-2013-1443: denial-of-service via large
 passwords

Hi

Django released a new advisory for a denial-of-service via large
passwords [1].

This is a short notice to avoid possible dublications of a CVE. The
Debian Security Team was asked shortly before the advisory release for
a CVE, and CVE-2013-1443 got assigned to this issue today.

Regards,
Salvatore
