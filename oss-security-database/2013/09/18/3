Subject: CVE Request : poppler < 0.13.0

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,
I'd like to request a CVE number for the following issue
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/poppler/DCTStream.cc?id=fc071d800cb4329a3ccf898d7bf16b4db7323ad8

The bug has been fixed in poppler 0.13.3, back in 2010, though it is
still present and exploitable in several distributions.

Thanks,

Etienne
