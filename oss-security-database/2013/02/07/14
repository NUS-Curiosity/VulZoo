The short answer is that you should map that MatrixSSL changelog
to CVE-2013-0169.

Here's how MITRE is currently looking at the set of issues:

CVE-2013-0169 is the identifier for the multi-vendor issue in the
TLS and DTLS protocols discussed in the
http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/TLStiming.pdf paper.

We anticipate that several more vendors will release changelogs,
with various levels of detail, mapping to that paper:

 -- If the changelog simply reports a new release to address that
    paper's issue, MITRE will consider that changelog to be a
    CVE-2013-0169 reference. A new CVE will not be created for that
    single vendor or a single product.

 -- If the vendor states that it uses a codebase corresponding to
    one of the other
    http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/02/05/24 CVEs (aka
    side issues), then the changelog will become a reference for
    that CVE.

 -- If the vendor makes any other statement about a vulnerability
    fix for a side issue, a new CVE will be created for the new side
    issue.

This approach should enable MITRE to provide reasonably consistent CVE
abstraction without detailed study of each vendor's code.
