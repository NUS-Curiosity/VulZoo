Sorry for the delay, it's been a crazy couple of weeks.

Fixed in 4.8.0.

no problem here, will assign once other Q's are answered.

Yup see the HOWTO. Initially I'll require full info up front to make
sure CVE split/merge is done correct, but this wouldn't go past me,
and if you can't trust me, well, then you go to Mitre I guess =).
Longer term depends on the quality of CVE requests, basically if you
learn to do them right and do them consistently right I'll require
less info/trust you.
