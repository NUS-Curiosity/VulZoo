Subject: RE: Two more ZoneMinder that need CVE

Actually, CVE covers default accounts and passwords, although known passwords from 1999 and earlier are not covered.

While this is arguably "configuration," in 2013, products are expected to have other mechanisms of securing themselves out of the box, such as forcing a credentials change during installation, plus there is usually a race condition between when the product is installed and when the administrator changes the credentials.

I think this is the CVE I Just assigned.

By default, ZoneMinder installs with default user credentials
(username/password combination). The 'zmuser' account has a password
of 'zmpass' and the 'admin' account has a password of 'admin', both of
which are publicly known and documented. This allows remote attackers
to trivially access the program or system and gain privileged access.

so it doesn't qualify for a CVE.
