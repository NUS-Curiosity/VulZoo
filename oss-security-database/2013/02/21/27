Ok, so the reporter indicated that the patch noted does not fix both
issues.  It fixed one issue and the other CreateID() function referenced
wasn't actually the CreateID() function he meant:

https://github.com/wichert/pyrad/blob/38f74b36814ca5b1a27d9898141126af4953bee5/pyrad/packet.py#L518

Different function and you can see that:

     CurrentID = (CurrentID + 1) % 256
     return CurrentID

isn't that great.

Now that CVE-2012-0295 has been rejected, I suppose we cannot re-use it
for this, but I think we need another CVE for the "real" CreateID()
sequential RADIUS packet ID issue.

Sorry about this.  I hadn't realized there was more than one CreateID()
function in there and the original report was short on details.
