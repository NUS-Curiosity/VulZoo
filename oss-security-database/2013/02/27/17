linux-distros [1] is vendor-sec replacement for Linux related issues.

Regrettably no. No notifications of Linux kernel security issues
reported to security@...nel.org mailing list to linux-distros (former
vendor-sec) are happening on regular basis. I (speaking as Red Hat
Security Response Team member in charge of kernel security issues) would
really appreciate the notifications. Even marking commits that were
committed as a result of security@...nel.org submission as sko
originated would be really helpful.

The linux-distros/oss-sec members can make sure that each issue gets CVE
and it's properly publicly communicated at the right time (preferably
when the issue is public -- when it is committed).

Should you consider this approach, is there anything I can help with to
make that happen?

Thank you,
