Every single patch we make to the kernel is public, it is up to you to
determine if you feel it is a "security fix" or not.  And to do so is a
non-trivial task, something that I sure don't want to be responsible for
trying to do.  And since no one else has ever stepped up to want to do
it either, there's not much more that can be done.

Are you willing to do it?
