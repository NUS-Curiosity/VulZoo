That's normal - users' home directories are normally accessible
only by users themselves, and never by othe users:

gremlin@...n:~ > ls -ld .
drwx-----x 47 gremlin users 20480 2013-02-26 17:48 ./

This is the most loosy home directory mode I use - that's for
accessing ~/www by httpd. Even there I use umask 027 and at
other (non-http) servers it's 077.

Also, please check the umask setting in this case - I guess
psi+ respects it when creating files.
