Yes, you're right, this did come from our pool.

We did provide this CVE to the OpenSSL team (at the time the request was
made we did not receive any disclosure on the issue and were not aware
of other affected implementations).  The intention was then just for
OpenSSL (perhaps under the assumption this was for an OpenSSL-specific
issue, again, unaware of the details of the flaw).

If MITRE wants to use it as a general name for the other affected
implementations (GnuTLS, NSS, etc.) as well, and not just OpenSSL,
that's fine.  We have not allocated any CVEs for these other
implementations, nor did we provide this CVE name to the authors of the
paper.

The long and short of it is a private (unspecified) request came from
the OpenSSL team and we provided it, so there was no specific intention
on our part as to how the name was used or what it meant.

I hope that clarifies things a bit.  We have no particular preference
either way, so we'll leave this to your discretion.

Thanks.
