Yeah, I believe so.  Last I looked, I came up with recommendations for
folks to use xmlCtxtUseOptions with XML_PARSE_NOENT, XML_PARSE_NONET,
and XML_PARSE_DTDLOAD set appropriately.  However, it wasn't 100%
clear to me at the time if these addressed all edge cases.  In
particular, I didn't care much about the DoS cases at the time, but
hopefully if DTDs are ignored, then it wouldn't be an issue.  

I'd love to hear from an expert on this matter.  For sure the
documentation needs to be improved...

Last I checked, I came to the same conclusion.
