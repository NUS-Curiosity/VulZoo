Subject: CVE request: Linux kernel: Bluetooth HIDP information disclosure

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with Bluetooth stack and HIDP support HCONFIG_BT=y/m & 
CONFIG_BT_HIDP=y/m is vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw caused by 
wrongly initializing the hid_device->name, physical location and unique 
identifier variables. Information leakage happens if these variables are not 
NULL('\0') terminated.

An unprivileged user/program could cause this via ioctl(HIDPCONNADD) call.

Upstream fix:
  -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/0a9ab9bdb3e891762553f667066190c1d22ad62b

Reference:
  -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=914298

Thank you.
