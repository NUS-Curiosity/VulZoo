Of course, exactly the same - 640, root:wheel :-)

I've built my own package (for Openwall GNU/*/Linux, not yet
in mainstream), and there I use explicit log file creation in
the %post section (touch && chown && chmod) without relying
on a umask (although in Owl it's restrictive by default: 077).

So I think that ${subject} is just a misconfiguration.
