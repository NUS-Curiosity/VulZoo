I've just looked at CVE-2012-5614 - it's not quite correct:

* it claims the bug was in UpdateXML - if you look at the exploit,
  you'll see that it sends an invalid packet to the server, the
  UpdateXML part is after the exit statement, so it's a dead code.

* it references https://mariadb.atlassian.net/browse/MDEV-3910
  which is about the invalid packet, not about UpdateXML

* but MDEV-3910 also mentions that this invalid packet crash was
  introduced in MySQL-5.5.18 and fixed in MySQL-5.5.21. While CVE entry
  says that MySQL 5.5.19 and MariaDB 5.5.28a are vulnerable.

* UpdateXML on the other hand, was vulnerable only in MySQL, starting
  from 5.6.6 and fixed in 5.6.10. Earlier MySQL versions and all MariaDB
  are not affected.

Regards,
Sergei
