The problem with security is you have to basically do it 100%
correctly 100% of the time, otherwise things fall through the cracks
(like this VFAT thing). That tends to fall outside of what most people
like to do as a hobby. Plus the volume needed, I think you
underestimate how long code reviews take especially with the volume
the Linux Kernel deals with. Hence the need to pay people so when they
spend 40-80 hours a week doing this they can also afford food and whatnot.

I've seen various attempts at crowd sourcing security, it doesn't work
so well for the simple fact that most security people are very busy,
and anyone that shows talent/good work ethic tends to get hired by a
company and get even more busy.
