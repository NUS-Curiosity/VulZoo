Ok, how could the Linux maintainers have done anything about this, when
the developers involved in creating this patch didn't even realize it
was a "security" issue in the first place?

I'm tired of people complaining about how the Linux kernel developers
handle security issues, when no one seems to have a suggestion as to how
anything could actually be done better.

And note, I was one of the people involved in this patch, and I didn't
notice anything special about it, so if you want to blame anyone, blame
me for not tagging it for inclusion in the stable kernel releases.
