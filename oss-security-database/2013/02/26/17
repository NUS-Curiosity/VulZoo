Also, what about the tmpfs one from yesterday? Nobody involved in the
patch reported that as a security bug to this list, until I saw it
myself, just by chance, as a random person on the internet, and posted
it to the list. In that case, it was clearly marked "use-after-free",
but nobody involved requested a CVE.
