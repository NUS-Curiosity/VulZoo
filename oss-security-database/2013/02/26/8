Please use CVE-2013-1773 for this issue.

I suspect part of the problem is scale. Most people don't understand
the scale at which the Linux Kernel and vendors handle bug fixes and
code changes. External people simply see a few poorly handled security
related issues and probably think "well how hard can it be to properly
a few extra security flaws?" but they don't see that those 5 security
issues were buried in 10,000 other code fixes. The resources needed to
audit every code change for a security impact simply aren't available
(and even if we had enough talented people who exactly is going to pay
them all?).

While things are not perfect (and likely never will be) I think they
are pretty good overall considering how much code and code change the
Linux Kernel handles.
