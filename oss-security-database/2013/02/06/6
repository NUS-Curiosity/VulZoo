Subject: e1000e/82574L hardware erratum

It's been reported that some Intel 82574L network controllers can be
brought into a non-processing state by receiving certain Ethernet
frames:

The packet is not malformed at the lower layers and will travel over
the Internet.

I have not tried to reproduced this.  Disabling hardware offloading
features might constitue a workaround.

Reportedly, this can be fixed by appropriate EEPROM settings, so a
driver-based workaround seems feasible/necessary.
