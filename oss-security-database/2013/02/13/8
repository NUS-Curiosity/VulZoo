[A] Doesn't have security implications if roundup is correnctly
configured. The bug would create a python backtrace. Unless the "debug"
option in section [web] is set (which is explicitly discouraged) this
will only display "an error has occurred" in the web-interface. Even if
someone sets the debug option in a production release only the hashed
password could be disclosed. Note that this bug only affects the anydbm
backend which should not be used for a production version either.

Please use CVE-2012-6130 for this issue

Please use CVE-2012-6131 for this issue

[D] No security implications: Fixed some permissions on files in
roundup/cgi and locale directories. These are not accessible via the
web-server. So this doesn't constitute a remote vulnerability. Local
users don't gain anything executing these files as no privilege
escalation is involved (they could copy the file which is readable
anyway and make their local copy executable).

Please use CVE-2012-6132 for this issue

This appears to be security hardening, not a vulnerability, is that
correct?
