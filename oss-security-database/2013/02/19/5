The good news is that the race is not trivial to win in an exploit. It
also requires access to ptrace() (but unfortunately most distros don't
limit ptrace()).

I didn't spend much time looking at that, but I think it may pre-date 2.6.

We don't know of any other architecture other that x86 affected, but
again, I don't think anyone spent time trying to figure this out. It's
possible that the same mistake was made on another architecture.

That's the eternal debate :) Since upstream doesn't want to handle
security and disclosure, I sure wish that distro vendors could
regroup, step-up and do it.

As for why it took so long for me to send this e-mail after the patch
went public: there is no good answer, mostly we were busy with other
things. Sorry about that.
