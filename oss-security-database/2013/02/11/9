Subject: CVE request: openconnect buffer overflow

Kevin Cernekee discovered that a malicious VPN gateway can send a very
long hostname/path (for redirects) or cookie list (in general), which
OpenConnect will attempt to write on a fixed length buffer.

Upstream commit:

<http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/openconnect.git/commitdiff/26f752c3dbf69227679fc6bebb4ae071aecec491>

This needs a CVE name from 2012.
