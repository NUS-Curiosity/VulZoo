Subject: Re: CVE request: Transmission can be made to crash
 remotely

Hello Yves-Alexis,

  to follow up on this one. The source of the issue
seems to be underlying libutp code:
[1] https://trac.transmissionbt.com/ticket/5002#comment:22

more specifically the way how libutp (previously) handled
selective acknowledgements, which resulted in following two
(libutp) patches:
[2] https://github.com/bittorrent/libutp/issues/38
[3] https://github.com/bittorrent/libutp/issues/37

Transmission upstream corrected this issue in v2.74:
[4] https://trac.transmissionbt.com/query?milestone=2.74&group=component&order=severity

with the following patch:
[5] https://trac.transmissionbt.com/changeset/13646

Ad assigning CVE ids - I think one CVE id is enough.
The problem is in libutp code, and Transmission upstream
seems to commit their own change only due to libutp
(un)responsiveness:

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
