Subject: CVE request: python-pyrad insecurities

Could a CVE be assigned to the following two issues please?

#1: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=911682

Nathaniel McCallum of Red Hat reported that pyrad was using Python's
random module in a number of places to generate pseudo-random data.  In
the case of the authenticator data, it was being used to secure a
password sent over the wire.  Because Python's random module is not
really suited for this purpose (not random enough), it could lead to
password hashing that may be predictable.

#2: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=911685

Nathaniel McCallum of Red Hat reported that pyrad was creating
serialized RADIUS packet IDs in the CreateID() function in packet.py.
This is not suitable for RADIUS as the RFC specifies that the ID must
not be predictable.  As a result, the ID of the next packet sent can be
spoofed.


These have been corrected in upstream's forthcoming version 2.1 via:
