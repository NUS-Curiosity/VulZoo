Well sure, some minority of apps will break.  Libraries release notes
merely need to say "next version breaks backward compatibility for
apps that use entities and inline DTDs.  If your app uses these,
explicitly enable with ..."  Once again, "off by default", not
removed.

Yes, but this is by far the least interesting attack scenario for most
XML libraries.  Since libxml2 is pretty limited in it's entities
support and network capabilities to begin with, it isn't as
interesting of a case for XXE generally.  However, other libraries
leverage many platform network capabilities that make for some much
more interesting attacks.
