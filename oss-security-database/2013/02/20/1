Subject: CVE request -- Linux kernel: mm: thp: pmd_present and PROT_NONE
 local DoS

Most VM places are using pmd_none but a few are still using pmd_present.
The meaning is about the same for the pmd. However pmd_present would
return the wrong value on PROT_NONE ranges. When the code using
pmd_present gets a false negative, the kernel will crash.

An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system.

Upstream fix:
