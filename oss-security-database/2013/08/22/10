Allow me to amend my statement: this *may* also affect third-party
software that incorporates our SCTP implementation, including Mozilla
Firefox and Google Chrome.  I can neither confirm nor deny that they are
actually vulnerable; all I can say is that a) I have it on good
authority that they use the same code (JFGI!) and b) they were notified
in advance.
