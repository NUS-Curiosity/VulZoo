Subject: YingZhi Lua Programming Language for iOS ftp .. bug & httpd arbitrary
 upload

Hi,

During further investigation of the Python programming language by XiaoWen for ipad/iphone I discovered a new Lua / Perl / Ruby programming application in the apple application store all written by XiaoWen Huang that suffers from the http file upload vulnerabilities. Â It appears the ../ has been fixed for these other applications.
