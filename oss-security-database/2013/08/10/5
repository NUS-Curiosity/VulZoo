Subject: CVE Request - HMS Testimonials 2.0.10 WP plugin

Hello

The HMS Tesminoalis version 2.0.10 plugin for WordPress contains multiple CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities.
This can be used in many different ways, like defacement of both public site and the admin area (only the HMS 
Testimonials plugin area will be affected), modify settings to set a lower role as moderator (very harmful on sites 
with open registrations), etc. Could CVE's be assigned to this?
