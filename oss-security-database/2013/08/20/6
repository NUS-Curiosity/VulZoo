I'm happy to answer, but am not on some of the list's CC'ed, so feel
free to pass my reply on. ;) 

keys.fedoraproject.org is just recently revived. We had some issues
with the sks software that runs on it and it was down for quite some
time. Those issues are hopefully solved now so we can bring it up full
time. 

Hopefully google will notice it once it's been up for a while.

keys.fedoraproject.org should sync with sks-keyservers.net. 
Not sure about the other 2.
