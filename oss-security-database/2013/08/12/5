Subject: CVE Request -- vdsm: incomplete fix for CVE-2013-0167 issue

It was found that fix for CVE-2013-0167 was not complete. A privileged
guest user could still potentially make the host the guest is running on
unavailable to the management server by making guest agent return data
with invalid XML characters.

Upstream fix:
