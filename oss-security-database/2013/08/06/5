What happens? OOM?

I'll recheck, but at first glance this is simple, unshare_userns()
populates new_cred which is not freed by bad_unshare_cleanup_fd
if create_user_ns() fails. And create_user_ns() _should_ fail (iiuc)
when CLONE_NEWUSER is called for the second time and later due to
!kuid_has_mapping().

I'll send the patch, but perhaps there is something else. Eric?

Oleg.
