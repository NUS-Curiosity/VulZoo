Subject: CVE request: SQL injection and shell escaping issues in Cacti <
 0.8.8b

Cacti 0.8.8b was released today [1] with a changelog that notes:

Cacti 0.8.8b Change Log
[...]
   * security: SQL injection and shell escaping issues

It looks like the SQL injection issue is in api_poller.php and
utility.php [2]

I think there are two shell escaping issue:

1) snmp.php: Use escapeshellarg() instead of custom escape function for snmp library [3]
2) rrd.php: Properly escape all user input for consumption by rrdtool [4]

[3] http://svn.cacti.net/viewvc?view=rev&revision=7392
[4] http://svn.cacti.net/viewvc?view=rev&revision=7393


Looks like 3 CVEs are needed.
