 deletion (CVE-2013-4183)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2013-021
CVE: CVE-2013-4183
Date: August 7, 2013
Title: Cinder LVM volume driver does not support secure deletion
Reporter: Rongze Zhu (UnitedStack)
Products: Cinder
Affects: 2013.1 (Grizzly) and later

Description:
Rongze Zhu from UnitedStack reported a vulnerability in the Cinder
LVM volume driver. The contents of LVM snapshots may not be cleared
upon deletion even when secure deletes are configured, resulting in
potential exposure of latent data to subsequent servers for other
tenants. Only setups using LVMVolumeDriver are affected.
