Subject: Re: CVE request: unauthorized host/service views displayed
 in servicegroup view

Hello,

sorry, I'm on holidays and cannot work on this issue for the next two
weeks. But I think that there is a missunderstanding. See my short
comment below.

As I understand this changelog entry, it means the following:

Hostgroups and servicegroups are listed with all the _authorized_
members if the user is authorized to see at least one member.

To me it doesn't mean the following (which was the case without my patch):

Servicegroups are listed with all members (regardless wether authorized
or unauthorized) if the user is authorized to see at least one member.

Another argument for my point of view is that the nagios maintainers
(silently) accepted my patch (at least if I remember correctly, it has
been incorporated into the upstream development repository).
Unfortunately there's still not one single statement from upstream about
the issue, that I'm aware of.

> I suspect this CVE should be rejected as this is done by design.

Like explained above, I disagree with this suggestion :)

Kind regards,
 jonas
