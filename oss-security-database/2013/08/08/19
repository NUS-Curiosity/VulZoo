My understanding would be no.  A follow-up CVE would be assigned if it
a) didn't fix the underlying security issue (it does) or b) introduced a
new security issue (it doesn't).

Botching the fix so that _functionality_ no longer works would not be
grounds for another CVE (although anyone backporting these would surely
want the additional fixes).
