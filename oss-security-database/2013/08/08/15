Yes, made them public. As can be seen in timestamp for Red Hat bugs,
original notes have been added by Florian pretty long time ago (but
still within this year, so 2013 ones should be applied).

Since these did not seem to follow some progress, made them public
(so people would at least know about the issues and could deprecate / obsolete
the package or look for other ways of solution).
