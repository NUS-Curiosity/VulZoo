I can't comment on that CVE specifically but on the reserved thing:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures

Description[edit source | editbeta]
This is a standardized text description of the issue(s). One common
entry is:

** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization or
individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem.
When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate
will be provided.

This means that the entry number has been reserved by Mitre for an
issue or a CNA has reserved the number. So in the case where a CNA
requests a block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently
requests CVEs in blocks of 500) the CVE number will be marked as
reserved even though the CVE itself may not be assigned by the CNA for
some time.
