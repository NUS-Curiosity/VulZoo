Very dangerous mistake. HTTPS should be used only for non-anonymous
access, otherwise plain HTTP is preferred. In any case, let the users
choose whether they want to use it.

Compare to FTP vs SCP/SFTP: first is for getting files from anyone
(into /incoming) and giving files for everyone (from /pub), second
is for transferring your own files. Obviously, I presume FTP daemon
to be configured for anonymous-only access.

Yes. But intercepting and modifying HTTPS requires just an ability
to issue client-trusted certificates (sufficient for 99% of HTTPS
applications), so the content signing should always be preferred
over distributor validation.
