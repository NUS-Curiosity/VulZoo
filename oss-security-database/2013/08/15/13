If you can't intercept, you don't know what's going on inside the TLS 
channel.  A malicious peer might successfully attack your user, and you 
could have thwarted the attack if you had access to plaintext 
communications.  (Yes, I understand what that sounds like.)

It used to be the case that little malicious content was hosted on 
major (HTTPS) sites, so analysis based on IP addresses and domain names 
was quite effective.  This might have changed, thoughâ€”all that is needed 
is one single, large HTTPS-enabled service provider that doesn't have 
adequate abuse mitigation.  But I still don't think that this is a valid 
reason not to use HTTPS.
