It only does that if you use http://. If you use https://rubygems.org,
it goes through S3 directly
(https://s3.amazonaws.com/production.s3.rubygems.org/)

See this code:
https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems-aws/blob/master/chef/site-cookbooks/rubygems/templates/default/nginx_balancer.conf.erb

I do wish they would fix their cipher suite choices, though. :/
