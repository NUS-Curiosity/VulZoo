This is literally the first time I've ever heard anyone say this, I'm
curious though, can you explain your reasoning/evidence for this
statement? You do realize HTTPS can be just as "anonymous" (ignoring
the fact you have the persons IP/time stamp, browser string, etc =) as
normal HTTP.

Now I'm just confused.

And now I'm seriously confused. For clients that do not validate
hostnames it would be true that you could get an HTTPS cert for any
domain name and use it, this would also work for the case where you
first use HTTP to get a redirect to HTTPS (the attacker intercepts the
HTTP and sends you to an attacker controlled HTTPS). Hence ALWAYS
using HTTPS!

I really suspect you have misunderstood what encrypted network
protocols are for. Typically they address three major problems:
integrity (attackers modifying traffic en route), confidentiality (by
encrypting it) and as an offshoot of these two properties, and the
magic of key exchanges you can also handle authentication securely, if
desired.
