Subject: CVE Request -- tpp: Possibility of arbitrary code execution when
 processing untrusted TPP template

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  A security flaw was found in the way tpp, a ncurses-based presentation tool,
processed TPP templates containing --exec clause (input provided as an argument
of the --exec clause would be immediately executed without requesting a second
confirmation from the user). A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted
text presentation program (TPP) template that, when processed with the tpp binary
would lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
the tpp executable.

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
