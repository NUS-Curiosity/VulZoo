No way. This is not an insecure configuration: This was never a Debian 
service and people are free to put whatever they want in /etc/apt/sources.list. 
There are hundreds of external apt sources and everyone of them could have
their owner changed at some point.

Also there's no security issue: If a domain is grabbed and someone configures
an apt repository on the site, he/she would lack the repository key previously
used to sign the repo.
