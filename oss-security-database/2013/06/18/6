Ah thanks, I forgot about that (I don't use Debian that often). So
with the signing key requirement in mind this is not a vuln.

However my original question still stands, can/should we consider a
common configuration of software that goes from being secure to
insecure to be worthy of a CVE? A lot of things that used to be common
practice (like shipping every service/server enabled, all accounts
active, all access enabled, anonymous uploads allowed, etc.) are now
seen as security vulnerabilities/exposures.

As for the security of the repo key proving that it it is safe/not
compromised would be hard, I'm guessing it wasn't held on an HSM, and
was it securely destroyed, or?

Also part of my thought process is that (for example) this would be a
good configuration to check for and ensure is disabled, something for
SCAP for example or the Debian security guide (e.g. a generic "make
sure all enabled repos are actually working as expected").
