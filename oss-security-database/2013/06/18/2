Subject: Thoughts on a vuln/CVE?

So I know technically CVEs are for software and not for services. But
in this case:

===================
http://bits.debian.org/2013/06/remove-debian-multimedia.html

The unofficial third party repository Debian Multimedia stopped using
the domain debian-multimedia.org some months ago. The domain expired
and it is now registered again by someone unknown to Debian. (If we're
wrong on this point, please sent us an email so we can take over the
domain! ;) )

This means that the repository is no longer safe to use, and you
should remove the related entries from your sources.list file.

After all, the need of an external repository for multimedia related
packages has been greatly reduced with the release of Wheezy, which
features many new and updated codecs and multimedia players.

Not sure if you're using the debian-multimedia repository? You can
easily check it by running:

grep -i debian-multimedia.org /etc/apt/sources.list
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*

If you can see debian-multimedia.org line in output, you should remove
all the lines including it.
===================

We have software with a now insecure configuration as it points to a
site that may or may not be under attacker control. It seems to me
like this might be a candidate for a CVE. Thoughts and comments for
and against are welcome (I'm on the fence myself).
