I'm not completely sure what assigning a CVE would give here. Debian
itself never shipped a package adding this apt source. Some people
might have shipped some external packages adding it, but I'm not really
aware of this. Usually the source was added manually by end-users.

So I'm not too sure what tracking the “issue” would actually give. Maybe
it can help raise awareness on this, but I'm not too convinced.
