Subject: CVE request: MovableType before 5.2.6

Hi everyone,

The 5.2.6 release of MovableType fixed a vulnerability in the handling
of comments to blog posts. The 'comment_state' parameter is processed by
MovableType's unserialize() function which can be used to send data into
Storable::thaw().


As documented by the perl-security team recently, Storable::thaw is
unsafe to use on untrusted inputs.

The MovableType 5.2.6 release notes document the fix for this
vulnerability as:

"109458 Currently un-used parameters are unintentionally deleted when a
comment is posted"
