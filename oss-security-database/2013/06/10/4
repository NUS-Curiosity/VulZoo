What do you mean by wasting time? Could you elaborate a bit more. I know that
there are several persons in this list who are actively fixing and reporting
security issues to Debian. Don't hide behind picture if you have some real
opinion why you should not be reporting bugs to Debian. You could even list the
problems here and I can deal with reporting part. Are you refering to this?
