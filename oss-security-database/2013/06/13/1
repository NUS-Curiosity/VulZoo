Ok, so the fix for this uses KRandom::random()...

I suggest leaving the KDE Paste fix as-is and replacing KRandom with
something that just fills an integer from /dev/urandom - then we can save a
few CVE numbers for the rest of the year.

qrand() should probably also do the same, especially since cnonces for HTTP
auth are using it - that means there's only 2^32 (at best) possible
cnonces...

  Michael
