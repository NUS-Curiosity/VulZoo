Subject: Xen Security Advisory 54 (CVE-2013-2078) - Hypervisor crash due
 to missing exception recovery on XSETBV

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

	     Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-2078 / XSA-54
                            version 3

       Hypervisor crash due to missing exception recovery on XSETBV

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Processors do certain validity checks on the register values passed to
XSETBV.  For the PV emulation path for that instruction the hypervisor
code didn't check for certain invalid bit combinations, thus exposing
itself to a fault occurring when invoking that instruction on behalf
of the guest.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or buggy unprivileged user space can cause the entire host
to crash.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.0 and onwards are vulnerable when run on systems with processors
supporting XSAVE.  Only PV guests can exploit the vulnerability.

In Xen 4.0.2 through 4.0.4 as well as in Xen 4.1.x XSAVE support is
disabled by default; therefore systems running these versions are not
vulnerable unless support is explicitly enabled using the "xsave"
hypervisor command line option.

Systems using processors not supporting XSAVE are not vulnerable.

Xen 3.x and earlier are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Turning off XSAVE support via the "no-xsave" hypervisor command line
option will avoid the vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.
