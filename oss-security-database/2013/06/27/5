Subject: CVE Request --  python-suds: Insecure temporary directory use when
 initializing file-based URL cache

Hello Kurt, Steve, vendors,

  based on the public Red Hat Bugzilla report:
  [1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=978696

by Ralph Loader:

A insecure temporary directory use flaw was found in the way
python-suds, a Python SOAP web services client library, performed
initialization of its internal file-based URL cache (predictable
location was used for directory to store the cached files). A
local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symbolic link
attacks, possibly leading to their ability for example the
SOAP .wsdl metadata to redirect queries to a different host,
than originally intended.

The reasons for the current behaviour are detailed at:
[2] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=978696#c4

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.

P.S.: There doesn't seem to be an upstream patch available yet (afaik),
      but the fix is obvious - use more unpredictable routine
      for file-based URL cache directory location generation than
      Python's tempfile.gettempdir() (which is case tempfile.tempdir
      is None, defaults to '/tmp').
