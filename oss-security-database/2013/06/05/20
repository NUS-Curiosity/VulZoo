As another CPAN contributor (though much less prolific than Russ), i
also think this would be great.

And wearing my hat as a member of the debian perl module packaging team,
i would be very happy to see this level of author-specific cryptographic
integrity checks when were updating packages from CPAN.  I suspect we
have enough people interested in this within the debian pkg-perl to
build in automated checks against these certifications during debian
packaging as well.

Thanks for continuing to maintain such a great archive of useful, free code.
