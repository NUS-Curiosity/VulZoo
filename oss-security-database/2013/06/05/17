Speaking as a CPAN author, the second would be awesome.  For bonus points,
once one registers a key with CPAN, CPAN could then even check one's
uploads and disallow uploads that aren't signed with the proper key.

It would require work by the CPAN maintainers, but the general
infrastructure is in place to do things like this and one could bootstrap
from CPAN username/password.
