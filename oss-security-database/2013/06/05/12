Subject: Joomla URL change

Hello list,

For some reason most (or all) developer.joomla.org security advisory links are
now 404. Even their own advisories have broken links. Example:

http://vel.joomla.org/jsn/12-20120308-core-xss-vulnerability.html points to
http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/399-20120308-core-xss-vulnerability.html

This is a problem because not all of the advisories contain CVE identifiers
and now vulnerability databases are refering to old addresses. For example
CVE-list refers to developer.joomla.org 64 times and OSVDB 100 times.

Address http://developer.joomla.org/security.html still exists and for example
http://developer.joomla.org/security/82-20130402-core-information-disclosure.html
works. Also http://docs.joomla.org/Security points to
http://forum.joomla.org/viewforum.php?f=372 which is labeled "Security
Announcements - Old"

Joomla: is this going to stay like this? Is there easy way to change the URLs?
