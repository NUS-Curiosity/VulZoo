             Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-1432 / XSA-58
                            version 2

        Page reference counting error due to XSA-45/CVE-2013-1918 fixes

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.  Credits section added.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The XSA-45/CVE-2013-1918 patch making error handling paths preemptible broke
page reference counting by not retaining a reference on pages stored for
deferred cleanup. This would lead to the hypervisor prematurely attempting to
free the page, generally crashing upon finding the page still in use.

CREDITS
=======

Thanks to Andrew Cooper and the Citrix XenServer team for discovering
and reporting this vulnerability, and helping investigate it.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or buggy PV guest kernels can mount a denial of service attack
affecting the whole system. It can't be excluded that this could also be
exploited to mount a privilege escalation attack.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions having the XSA-45/CVE-2013-1918 fixes applied are vulnerable.

The vulnerability is only exposed by PV guests.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only HVM guests, or PV guests with trusted kernels, will avoid this
vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.
