Subject: CVE request: Monkey HTTPD - DoS due bug on Range header handling

I've found an issue on the way as Monkey HTTPD handle the Range HTTP header
when receiving Range:bytes=N-N where N is the exact file size, which causes
the
thread to go into an infinite loop, hence keeping the server busy on each
request until a server shutdown.

More details on bug report at http://bugs.monkey-project.com/ticket/184
