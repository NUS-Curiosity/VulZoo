I consider this a security bug in the debian package's maintainer
scripts: it is a race condition that leaks confidential information to a
user who "wins" the race.  It is *not* a misconfiguration; it is a bug
with security implications.

If you know of more bugs like this, please report them with an e-mail to
submit@...s.debian.org with the first line "Package: FOO" (where "FOO"
is replaced by the name of the buggy package).  Thanks!

I respectfully disagree; if an upstream package leaks confidential
information to an adversary who "wins" a race, that is a bug which
deserves a CVE.  Debian packaging bugs should be held to the same standard.
