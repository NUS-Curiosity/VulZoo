Subject: Squirrelmail XSS Fixes

Hi,

A while ago I saw that there were some very old XSS reports in the
squirrelmail bugtracker and reported it to this list:
https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/06/27/5

If anyone's interested, squirrelmail upstream has now fixed those (in
SVN, they don't do releases):
https://sourceforge.net/p/squirrelmail/bugs/2831/

I had proposed a different (and imho simpler) patch, I never got any
feedback from the developer why he didn't like it. I also sent multiple
fixes for warnings and issues with newer PHP versions that mostly
haven't been applied, in case you are interested, see
