CVE-2019-0212: HBase REST Server incorrect user authorization

Description: In all previously released Apache HBase 2.x versions, 
authorization was incorrectly applied to users of the HBase REST server. 
Requests sent to the HBase REST server were executed with the 
permissions of the REST server itself, not with the permissions of the 
end-user. This issue is only relevant when HBase is configured with 
Kerberos authentication, HBase authorization is enabled, and the REST 
server is configured with SPNEGO authentication. This issue does not 
extend beyond the HBase REST server.

Versions affected: 2.0.0-2.0.4, 2.1.0-2.1.3

Mitigation: Stop the HBase REST server until your installation is 
upgraded to HBase 2.0.5, 2.1.4, or any other later release. Upon 
upgrading to a newer version, no other action is required.
