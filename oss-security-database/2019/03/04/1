Subject: CVE-2018-11793: Mesos components might crash when parsing deeply
 nested JSON structures.

Severity: Moderate

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Mesos 1.4.0 to 1.7.0
The unsupported Apache Mesos pre-1.4.0 releases may be also affected.

Description:
When parsing a JSON payload with deeply nested JSON structures, the
parser might overflow the stack due to unbounded recursion. A
malicious actor can therefore cause a denial of service of Mesos
masters rendering the Mesos-controlled cluster inoperable.

Mitigation:
pre-1.4.x users should upgrade to at least 1.4.3
1.4.x users should upgrade to 1.4.3
1.5.x users should upgrade to 1.5.2
1.6.x users should upgrade to 1.6.2
1.7.0 users should upgrade to 1.7.1
1.8-dev users should obtain Mesos 1.8.0 or later
