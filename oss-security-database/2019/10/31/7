Reply from the Python project:

Thanks for the heads-up.  During the 3.5.8 release process, I actually generated the tarball multiple times, and although I never officially released these previous versions, somehow the CDN latched onto this one .xz file from one of these test versions.  As you note, the MD5 sum and file size on the release page were correct for the final version; also, the v3.5.8 tag in the Git repo and the GPG checksum file also match this final (correct) version.

Still, it's a messy situation.  Fedora has already updated to 3.5.8, and they got the tarball without the fix for bpo-38243.

As you suggest, the best way to ameliorate this debacle is to just release a 3.5.9.  I'll do that in the next day or so.  In the meantime I'll send a quick note to the clp newsgroups.

Kind regards,
