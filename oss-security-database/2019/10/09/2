Subject: Re: Multiple vulnerabilities in Centreon-Web and Centreon-VM

Hello,

My advisory posted yesterday contains a problematic typo: CVE-2019-17017 should have been written CVE-2019-17107. Sorry for the inconvenience it may have caused.

Here is the corrected context:
> High impact
> ===========
>
> CVE-2019-17107: Authenticated RCE in minPlayCommand.php
> -------------------------------------------------------
> Details: https://github.com/centreon/centreon/pull/7099

> Fixed in 18.10.4    (https://github.com/centreon/centreon/pull/7232)

Original advisory follows.
