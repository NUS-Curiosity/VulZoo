Hello Michael and oss-security,

I'm from the NixOS Security Team[0]. We handle security reports for
Nix, NixOS, and the Nix ecosystem.

> Bug report: Reported privately to the NixOS security team on 2019-08-19.

I can confirm we received, validated, and improperly handled this
report.

I took lead on this issue and began authoring a patch to fix it. We
had a partial fix, and I dropped the ball. I have opened up my partial
patch to the greater NixOS security community[1] to get help in
finishing this off.

Unfortunately, the problem is in a challenging spot: the code must be
authored very carefully to not fail. More unfortunately, the root of
this issue has been known for some time[2].

As soon as we are comfortable with a fix, we will release a new
version of Nix.

We will also examine how we handle security issues, and publish a
post-mortem of how this happened and how our processes will be changed
to prevent this from happening again.

Thank you, Michael for bringing this issue to the public eye.
