Subject: Minerva: ECDSA key recovery from bit-length leakage

*Webpage*
=========

https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/


*Vulnerability*
===============

Minerva is a group of vulnerabilities in ECDSA/EdDSA implementations that allows
for practical recovery of the long-term private key.

We have found implementations which leak the bit-length of the scalar during
scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve. This leakage might seem minuscule as
the bit-length presents a very small amount of information present in the
scalar. However, in the case of ECDSA/EdDSA signature generation, the leaked
bit-length of the random nonce is enough for full recovery of the private key
used after observing a few hundreds to a few thousands of signatures on known
messages, due to the application of lattice techniques.
