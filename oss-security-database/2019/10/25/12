There's been a lot of work in the crypto community in this direction.
Most of it is code under OSS licenses:

Hacl* is a formally verified crypto library. Some of the crypto
algorithm implementations are used in Mozilla's NSS:

There's been a formal verification of (a subset of) PolarSSL:

This is an incomplete list, just the first things I remembered, there's
a lot more.

In terms of operating system kernels there's sel4:
