Subject: CVE-2019-8934 QEMU: ppc64: sPAPR emulator leaks the host hardware
 identity

   Hello,

It was found that the KVM PPC64 emulator for the sPAPR machine leaks the host 
hardware identity to all running guests. The sPAPAR(hw/ppc/spapr.c) emulator 
populates the device tree for the guest with two fields "host-serial" and 
"host-model". The values for these fields are taken via hypervisor from the 
host device tree data exposed in "/proc/device-tree/system-id" and 
"/proc/device-tree/model" file respectively.

Upstream patch:

Thank you.
