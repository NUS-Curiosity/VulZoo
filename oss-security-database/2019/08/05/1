Subject: New Tool - Phishing Simulation

Hello Team,

I have developed this tool "Phishing Simulation", which might be a good fit
for your arsenal.

https://github.com/jenyraval/Phishing-Simulation

I will also be presenting this one at defcon this year. Let me know if any
more information is needed.

Thanks!
Jyoti Raval
