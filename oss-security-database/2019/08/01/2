Subject: CVE-2019-14378 QEMU: slirp: heap buffer overflow during packet
 reassembly

   Hello,

A heap buffer overflow issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation 
of the QEMU emulator. It occurs in ip_reass() routine while reassembling 
incoming packets, if the first fragment is bigger than the m->m_dat[] buffer.

A user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process on the host 
resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code with privileges of the 
QEMU process.
