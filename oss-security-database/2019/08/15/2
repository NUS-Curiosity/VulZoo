CVE-2019-10081: mod_http2, memory corruption on early pushes

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
httpd 2.4.20 to 2.4.39

Description:
HTTP/2 very early pushes, for example configured with "H2PushResource",
could lead to an overwrite of memory in the pushing request's pool,
leading to crashes. The memory copied is that of the configured push
link header values, not data supplied by the client.
 
Mitigation:
All httpd users deploying mod_http2 should upgrade to 2.4.40 or later.
Unpatched servers can disable HTTP/2 push with the "H2Push off" directive.
