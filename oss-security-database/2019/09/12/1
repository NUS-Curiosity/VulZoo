Subject: pam_p11 0.3.1 released

Hi all!

I'm happy to announce the new pam_p11 release 0.3.1, which can be found
here https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_p11/releases/tag/pam_p11-0.3.1.
<https://github.com/OpenSC/pam_p11/releases/tag/pam_p11-0.3.1> This release
fixes a buffer overflow when creating signatures longer than 256 bytes
(CVE-2019-16058). This bug is present in pam_p11 version 0.2.0 and 0.3.0.

Regards, Frank.
