Subject: [CVE-2019-0195] Apache Tapestry vulnerability disclosure

CVE-2019-0195: File reading Leads Java Deserialization Vulnerability
Severity: important
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Versions affected: all Apache Tapestry versions between 5.4.0, including
its betas, and 5.4.3

Description:
Manipulating classpath asset file URLs, an attacker could guess the path to
a known file in the classpath and have it downloaded. If the attacker found
the file with the value of the tapestry.hmac-passphrase configuration
symbol, most probably the webapp's AppModule class, the value of this
symbol could be used to craft a Java deserialization attack, thus running
malicious injected Java code. The vector would be the t:formdata parameter
from the Form component.

Mitigation:
Upgrade to Tapestry 5.4.5, which is a drop-in replacement for any 5.4.x
version.
