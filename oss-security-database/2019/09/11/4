Subject: [CVE-2019-10074] Apache OFBiz RCE (template injection)

Severity:
Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
OFBiz 16.11.01 to 16.11.05

An RCE is possible by entering Freemarker markup in an OFBiz Form Widget
textarea field when encoding has been disabled on such a field.  This was
the case for the Customer Request "story" input in the Order Manager
application.  Encoding should not be disabled without good reason and never
within a field that accepts user input.


Mitigation:
Upgrade to 16.11.06
or manually apply the following commit on branch 16.11:
r1858533
