In the immediate term, yes, it's easy to see potential benefits. In
the long term, it will harm people.

Second line of the original email: "This is not a security vulnerability itâ€™s a privacy issue."

>and unlike Snapchat, the Telegram client *is* open source.

The Telegram ecosystem is closed-source.

Regardless, Telegram clients don't have to respect this setting, so
the feature is a lie. The only way to enforce message deletion is
through drm-like means (Snapchat...), which doesn't work anyway. That
Telegram allows third-party clients only makes it worse, in a way.
