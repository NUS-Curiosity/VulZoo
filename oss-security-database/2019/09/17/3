Subject: OpenDMARC buffer overflows

Hi,

In light of the recent OpenDMARC issue I had a look at their Github PR
tracker. This one
https://github.com/trusteddomainproject/OpenDMARC/pull/45
caught my attention.

Quote:
"Fix a few potential crashes

    Fix missing from_domain check for store_dkim
    Add checks for longer than buffer while parsing record"


This seems to add and fix a few length checks for buffers, i.e. fixing
buffer overflows.
I haven't analyzed it in detail.
