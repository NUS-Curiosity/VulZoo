Subject: Open source tool | Lets Map Your Network

Let’s Map Your Network (LMYN) aims to provide an easy to use interface
to security engineer and network administrator to have their network
in graphical form with zero manual error, where a node represents a
system and relationship between nodes represent the connection.

It is utmost important for any security engineer to understand their
network first before securing it and it becomes a daunting task to
have a ‘true’ understanding of a widespread network. In a mid to large
level organisation’s network having a network architecture diagram
doesn’t provide the complete understanding and manual verification is
a nightmare. Hence in order to secure entire network it is important
to have a complete picture of all the systems which are connected to
your network, irrespective of their type, function, technology etc.

BOTTOM LINE - YOU CAN'T SECURE WHAT YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF.

LMYN does it in two phases:
1. Learning: In this phase LMYN 'learns' the network by performing the
network commands and querying the APIs and then builds graph database
leveraging the responses. User can perform any of the learning
activities at any point of time and LMYN will incorporate the results
in existing database.
2. Monitoring: This is a continuous process, where LMYN monitors the
'in-scope' network for any changes, compare it with existing
information and update the graph database accordingly.
