Subject: Re: Re: fprintd: found storing user fingerprints
 without encryption

I am sorry to say that I am not familiar with this mailing list.

I am not insisting that encryption key should be on the disk or is
encrypted with a static key that is embedded in the binary.
Instead, we can make fprintd to use a TPM, if available.
Otherwise, but even though it is not perfect, it would be better to apply
the fingerprint data protection, such as keyring or access control, rather
than raw fingerprint template.
FYI, Windows Hello might use Next Generation Cryptography (called CNG) to
protect and store user private data and encryption keys.

Microsoft Windows Hello and other products.

Have you read the following papers about fingerprint image reconstruction
technology from standard templates?
[1] R. Cappelli et al., “Fingerprint Image Reconstruction from Standard
Templates”, IEEE Trans. on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,
vol.29, no.9, pp.1489-1503, 2007.
[2] A. Ross et al., “From template to image: Reconstructing fingerprints
from minutiae points”, IEEE Trans on Pattern Analysis and Machine
Intelligence, vol.29, no.4, pp.544-560, 2007.
[3] R. Cappelli et al., “Can Fingerprints be reconstructed from ISO
Templates?”, IEEE ICARCV 2006.
[4] J. Feng et al., “Fingerprint Reconstruction: From Minutiae to Phase”,
IEEE Trans on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol.33, no.2,
pp.209-223, 2011.
[5] A. Rozsa et al., "Genetic Algorithm Attack on Minutiae-Based
Fingerprint Authentication and Protected Template Fingerprint Systems",
CVPR 2015.

>They presents methods to create sophisticated and natural-looking
fingerprints only from the numerical template data.

state-of-the-art algorithms and the NIST Fingerprint Image Software.

Lastly, as you mentioned,  it is a stupid idea to use it for various
authentication.
But, it is still working on various authentication/identification system.
