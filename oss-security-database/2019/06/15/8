Within four years, most users will encounter updated software which 
includes the fixes, assuming that an available developer did produce a 
fix.

If you are interested in improving the software, I suggest rolling up 
your sleeves and getting involved with implementing fixes.  Indeed, 
only a small fraction of involved people are working on implementing 
fixes.

The "better" programming languages may prevent some of these problems 
due to not allowing direct access to memory, but they introduce 
new/different types of problems which can also be serious.  Indeed 
some popular languages like Python, Perl, or Javascript seem more 
dangerous than C/C++ programs.
