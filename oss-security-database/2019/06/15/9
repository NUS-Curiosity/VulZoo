Subject: GraphicsMagick 1.3.32 security fixes, plus one of special mention

GraphicsMagick 1.3.32 is now released, fixing another 52 additional 
issues detected by oss-fuzz.

Of special mention is a bug reported to us by "Battle Furry" via our 
security mail alias.  This bug (was considered to be a "feature") 
allows including file text as rendered text on a graphic image, or as 
text hidden in metadata, by using a file refered to with '@...ename' 
syntax where text to be rendered normally appears.  This issue was 
inherited from ImageMagick 5.5.2 and it even appears in ImageMagick 
4.2.9.

It has been determined that the SVG and WMF formats may be used to 
supply this '@...ename' syntax, resulting in rendered text on a 
graphic image, or as text hidden in metadata (e.g. the image comment). 
Furthermore, it may be that other applications and web sites accept 
text to be rendered on behalf of users and that this issue could allow 
untrusted users to receive content considered to be secure and private 
(e.g. private keys or passwords).

A small patch to fix this issue is attached.  Any distribution of 
GraphicsMagick needs this patch if it is not possible to upgrade to 
the latest release.
