I'm not really talking about potential regressions: I'm talking about real
functional changes that the end-user doesn't expect (nor want) in a stable
release. Backporting is often a pain, but full throttle to latest release also
has a burden (for the end-user, for the distributor and so on). It really
depends on the project (and I don't want to point fingers, it's not the
point).

But then again the question is, who do the work (of backporting, regression
testing, etc.) And again it's not always about bugs, it might very well be
that there's a user interface change requiring a lot of documentation updates
downwards, a dependency chain update or whatever.

There might be good reasons for stability, even besides not introducing new
bugs, that was just my point.
