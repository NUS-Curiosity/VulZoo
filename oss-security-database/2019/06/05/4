As per the distros list policy:

Below is an abridged version of our advisory (with all the vulnerability
details, but without exploitation details); we will publish the complete
version in 24 hours, or as soon as third-party exploits are published,
whichever happens first.

We believe that it makes no sense to delay this any longer than that:
this vulnerability is trivially exploitable in the local and non-default
cases (attackers will have working exploits before that, public or not);
and in the default case, a remote attack takes a long time to succeed
(to the best of our knowledge).

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

During a code review of the latest changes in the Exim mail server
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exim), we discovered an RCE vulnerability
in versions 4.87 to 4.91 (inclusive). In this particular case, RCE means
Remote *Command* Execution, not Remote Code Execution: an attacker can
execute arbitrary commands with execv(), as root; no memory corruption
or ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) is involved.

This vulnerability is exploitable instantly by a local attacker (and by
a remote attacker in certain non-default configurations). To remotely
exploit this vulnerability in the default configuration, an attacker
must keep a connection to the vulnerable server open for 7 days (by
transmitting one byte every few minutes). However, because of the
extreme complexity of Exim's code, we cannot guarantee that this
exploitation method is unique; faster methods may exist.

Exim is vulnerable by default since version 4.87 (released on April 6,
2016), when #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT became #ifndef DISABLE_EVENT; and
older versions may also be vulnerable if EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT was enabled
manually. Surprisingly, this vulnerability was fixed in version 4.92
(released on February 10, 2019):

https://github.com/Exim/exim/commit/7ea1237c783e380d7bdb86c90b13d8203c7ecf26
https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2310

but was not identified as a security vulnerability, and most operating
systems are therefore affected. For example, we exploit an up-to-date
Debian distribution (9.9) in this advisory.


========================================================================
Local exploitation
========================================================================

The vulnerable code is located in deliver_message():

6122 #ifndef DISABLE_EVENT
6123       if (process_recipients != RECIP_ACCEPT)
6124         {
6125         uschar * save_local =  deliver_localpart;
6126         const uschar * save_domain = deliver_domain;
6127
6128         deliver_localpart = expand_string(
6129                       string_sprintf("${local_part:%s}", new->address));
6130         deliver_domain =    expand_string(
6131                       string_sprintf("${domain:%s}", new->address));
6132
6133         (void) event_raise(event_action,
6134                       US"msg:fail:internal", new->message);
6135
6136         deliver_localpart = save_local;
6137         deliver_domain =    save_domain;
6138         }
6139 #endif

Because expand_string() recognizes the "${run{<command> <args>}}"
expansion item, and because new->address is the recipient of the mail
that is being delivered, a local attacker can simply send a mail to
"${run{...}}@...alhost" (where "localhost" is one of Exim's
local_domains) and execute arbitrary commands, as root
(deliver_drop_privilege is false, by default):

[...]


========================================================================
Remote exploitation
========================================================================

Our local-exploitation method does not work remotely, because the
"verify = recipient" ACL (Access-Control List) in Exim's default
configuration requires the local part of the recipient's address (the
part that precedes the @ sign) to be the name of a local user:

[...]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-default configurations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We eventually devised an elaborate method for exploiting Exim remotely
in its default configuration, but we first identified various
non-default configurations that are easy to exploit remotely:

- If the "verify = recipient" ACL was removed manually by an
  administrator (maybe to prevent username enumeration via RCPT TO),
  then our local-exploitation method also works remotely.

- If Exim was configured to recognize tags in the local part of the
  recipient's address (via "local_part_suffix = +* : -*" for example),
  then a remote attacker can simply reuse our local-exploitation method
  with an RCPT TO "balrog+${run{...}}@...alhost" (where "balrog" is the
  name of a local user).

- If Exim was configured to relay mail to a remote domain, as a
  secondary MX (Mail eXchange), then a remote attacker can simply reuse
  our local-exploitation method with an RCPT TO "${run{...}}@...zad.dum"
  (where "khazad.dum" is one of Exim's relay_to_domains). Indeed, the
  "verify = recipient" ACL can only check the domain part of a remote
  address (the part that follows the @ sign), not the local part.

Default configuration
