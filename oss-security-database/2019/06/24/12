Unfortunately there are people who runs scans to see what CVEs are fixed and if all the known CVEs aren't fixed then they scream and shout.   It doesn't matter whether the CVE represents a viable exploit, it has to be fixed.

Yes, off-by-one errors, overflows and the like are all *potential* security flaws, but by allocating a CVE for all those potential issues you're trying to turn CVEs into a bug database.

I'm looking at one here that says "allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact".   That gets a CVSS score up in the stratosphere when, in this case, it's a bug that a user would have to inflict on themselves provided they have the right hardware.   I know I'm over-simplifying this one, but it remains that the "unspecified other impact" is highly speculative, not to mention dubious, and the DoS is not the total loss of service that the stratospheric score indicates.

On the face of it, even a partial DoS is a security problem, but in this case the pre-requisites for exercising this particular bug would pretty much also categorise "rm -rf /*" as a security issue.

Automatically creating CVEs from fuzzer results is going to just mean that the real problems get passed by: a little thought needs to go into it first.
