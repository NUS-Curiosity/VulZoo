Thanks a lot for explaining the roles of primary and backup with such

That seems fair, thank you!

Great! I'd like to request that Alexey Makhalov (amakhalov@...are.com)
from the Photon OS team be added to the linux-distros list. I have
worked with Alexey closely for several years and I'm happy to vouch
for him.

Thank you!
