Subject: [CVE-2019-12419] Apache CXF OpenId Connect token service does not
 properly validate the clientId

[CVEID]:CVE-2019-12419
[PRODUCT]:Apache CXF
[VERSION]:Apache CXF versions before 3.3.4 and 3.2.11
[PROBLEMTYPE]:Apache CXF OpenId Connect token service does not properly
validate the clientId
[REFERENCES]:
http://cxf.apache.org/security-advisories.data/CVE-2019-12419.txt.asc
[DESCRIPTION]:Apache CXF provides all of the components that are required
to build a fully
              fledged OpenId Connect service. There is a vulnerability in
the access token
              services, where it does not validate that the authenticated
principal is equal
              to that of the supplied clientId parameter in the request.

              If a malicious client was able to somehow steal an
authorization code issued
              to another client, then they could exploit this vulnerability
to obtain an
              access token for the other client.
