To clarify, which of these do you mean?

A. IA-32 (uname -m: i?86) Linux kernels are buggy/vulnerable when running
   IA-32 (i?86-linux-*) user-space processes (which are the only user-space
   that these kernels support)

B. x86_64 (aka AMD64, uname -m: x86_64) Linux kernels are buggy/vulnerable
   when running IA-32 (i?86-linux-*) user-space processes, but not when
   running x86_64 (x86_64-linux-*) user-space processes

C. x86_64 (AMD64) Linux kernels are buggy/vulnerable when running x32
   (x86_64-linux-gnux32) processes

D. something else?

If I'm understanding correctly, you are reporting A, and only A?

Thanks,
