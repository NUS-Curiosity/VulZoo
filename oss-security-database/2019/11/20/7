In your opinion, how does this compare with proprietary operating
systems? Do they have more or less code executed than modern
GNU/Linux systems (or can we even know)? How about the popular BSD
Unix derivatives? What is your benchmark for the correct amount of
code to be executed, or is this analysis based on comparison with an
abstract ideal operating system archetype?
