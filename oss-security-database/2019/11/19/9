Indeed. Reproducible builds does not solve the case described by Ken Thompson in
Trusting Trust [1], nor enables the work described by David Wheeler and DDC [2].
But that isn't explicitly the goal either. We first need to be in a state where
we are capable of reproducing the distributed artifacts. Then we can investigate
the boostrap problem.

Which is why Reproducible Builds is also invested in this problem :) There is a
yearly summit with projects that contribute to reproducible builds. Last year in
Paris there where 3 sessions on bootstrapping [3][4][5]. The sessions where
mostly lead by Guix developers if I recall correctly, and they have been doing
great progress on this problem [6].
