One attack that is not solved by reproducible builds is one on the toolchain.
This can be solved with bootstrappable builds[1] which is about minimizing the
number of trusted binaries that are needed to produce the toolchain, that
produced the toolchain, ... that was used to build your package.

There was a talk this year called "Bitcoin Build System Security" by Carl Dong
about this topic[2].
