So these links seem to say that things have been structured so you
*can't* run GUI apps as root, not that there is a special or unusual
security problem in Wayland if you run an application as root; if
you logged in as root, you could run GUI applications as root. That's
rather different from the original statement. Am I misunderstanding?
