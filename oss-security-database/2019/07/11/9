I agree.  It is rather common that more than one file needs to be 
modified at one time.  If a more complex mechanism like a sqlite3 
database needs to be updated, then the implementation of sqlite3 will 
expect to be able to access files in a normal way and it will expect 
to be use all the abilities it normally uses.  It is rather common 
that atomic operations are required, locking is required, the ability 
to link/rename files is required, and that synchronization of file 
content and directories is required.

In addition to the security concerns, it is difficult to see how a 
virtual filesystem intended for use by simplistic GUI file managers 
will satisfy common administrative requirements.
