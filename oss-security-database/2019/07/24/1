On the Samba team we use wording like this:

Subject: Heads-up: Security Releases ahead!

Hi,

This is a heads-up that there will be Samba security updates on
Wednesday, June 19 2019. Please make sure that your Samba
servers will be updated soon after the release!

Impacted components:
 - AD DC (CVSS 6.5, Medium)
-----------------------------

We now do this systematically, after a haphazard start.

To help ourselves stay on track, we are trying to formalise our
process into something approaching a checklist:

and we are happy to hear suggestions for improvement.

cheers,
Douglas
