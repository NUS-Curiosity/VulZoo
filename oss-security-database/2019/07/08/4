Please just take this to LKML, without CC to oss-security.  We can
summarize the changes for oss-security separately.  I don't know about
relevance to ksummit-discuss.

This might or might not be an exception, but in general CC'ing a thread
to LKML and oss-security is problematic and is specifically discouraged
in oss-security content guidelines:

https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines

"Please don't cross-post messages to oss-security and other mailing
lists at once, especially not to high-volume lists such as LKML and
netdev, as this tends to result in threads that wander partially or
fully off-topic (e.g., Linux kernel coding style detail may end up being
discussed in comments to a patch posted to LKML, but it would be
off-topic for oss-security).  If you feel that something needs to be
posted to oss-security and to another list, please make separate
postings.  You may mention the other posting(s) in your oss-security
posting, and even link to other lists' archives."

I think listing "Microsoft Linux Systems Group" is enough to avoid the
confusion.  I support Moritz's request for you to add to our existing
wiki pages with vendors' security contact information, and you can list
the pertaining products/distros nearby.
