Ok, so I went back all the way to 3.16, and in 4.4 and earlier the
only user of fb_edid_add_monspecs() was that SH-Mobile SoCs driver
that got removed for no use.

So I think we can ignore this even for stable kernels, and I'll get
the pull request that removes the function entirely some time in the
future.
