Somehow there isn't a proper message from Exim maintainers in here yet,
but the release is out, so I feel I have to take over and post this for
them:

General release information
===========================

The code fix for this issue has been placed in the project
public git repository; the project website will be updated

CVE ID:     CVE-2019-13917
OVE ID:     OVE-20190718-0006
Date:       2019-07-18
Credits:    Jeremy Harris
Version(s): 4.85 up to and including 4.92
Issue:      A local or remote attacker can execute programs with root
            privileges - if you've an unusual configuration. For details
            see below.



Coordinated Release Date (CRD) for Exim 4.92.1:
            Thu Jul 25 10:00:00 UTC 2019



Contact:    security@???



Details:
A vulnerability was discovered in the "sort" expansion operator:
The elements of the list were expanded, giving a possible attack
if the list included data supplied by an attacker.

If the effective configuration file for exim does not use sort
then the system is trivially declarable as not being vulnerable.
Use this command to check: "exim -bP config | grep sort".
