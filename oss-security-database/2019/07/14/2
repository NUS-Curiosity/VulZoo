This will be much appreciated, thanks!

Will this be taken care of by Ubuntu Security Team members who are
already on linux-distros (highly preferable) or will we need to
subscribe more people just for these roles (would be non-ideal)?

For 3, do you prefer to be "primary" or "backup"?  (We already have
Amazon listed as "primary", but as discussed Amazon is yet to become
more active in this role.)

Will you personally be involved?  What's your role with the Ubuntu
Security Team?

I notice you don't appear to be on oss-security, so am copying this
reply to you and to the list.

Thanks again,

Alexander
