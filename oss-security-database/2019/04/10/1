SECURITY-1289 / CVE-2019-1003049
The fix for SECURITY-901 in Jenkins 2.150.2 and 2.160 did not reject 
existing remoting-based CLI authentication caches.

This means that users who cached their CLI authentication before Jenkins was 
updated to 2.150.2 and newer, or 2.160 and newer, would remain authenticated.

Support for the remoting-based CLI was dropped in Jenkins 2.165, so newer 
weekly releases are not affected.


SECURITY-1327 / CVE-2019-1003050
The f:validateButton form control for the Jenkins UI did not properly escape 
job URLs. This resulted in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability 
exploitable by users with the ability to control job names.
