Subject: XSS in roundup bug tracker 404 page

Hi,

I recently discovered that the python bug tracker had a trivial
reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability on the 404 error page.

It essentially just reflected the URL path, so anything like
http://hostname/<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
(properly URL-encoded, but browsers do this automatically)
would result in XSS.

The software python is using here is the Roundup issue tracker, it's
been reported there as well [2] and fixed in their repo (but no release
yet).
