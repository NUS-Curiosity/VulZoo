It is a bit unfortunate that these security fixes now use
isc_atomic_xadd() which are not available on all architectures:

.libs/client.o: In function `mark_tcp_active':
client.c:(.text+0xc7c): undefined reference to `isc_atomic_xadd'
client.c:(.text+0xca0): undefined reference to `isc_atomic_xadd'
.libs/client.o: In function `client_accept':
client.c:(.text+0x2210): undefined reference to `isc_atomic_xadd'
client.c:(.text+0x230c): undefined reference to `isc_atomic_xadd'
.libs/client.o: In function `exit_check':
client.c:(.text+0x2958): undefined reference to `isc_atomic_xadd'
.libs/client.o:client.c:(.text+0x5cb4): more undefined references to `isc_atomic_xadd' follow
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
