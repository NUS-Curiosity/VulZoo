Pls no policykit... This "attack" works only because there is systemd, so that
is where such calls should be blocked, IMHO.

It turns out, that if as an unprivileged user I do "pkill -9 systemd" (this
line is infact in my .bash_profile) to eliminate all systemd --user processes,
this still works, i.e. I am able to send messages to the system bus.
