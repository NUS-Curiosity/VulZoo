The tpp.c error and child abort are also logged when testing without pool debugging or ASAN.

This can happen if the mutex data is corrupted, so it's possible this
also caused by a use-after-free issue (if the memory is reallocated and
overwritten before the mutex operation that causes the assertion
failure).

Did you observe this with the pool debugger only?
