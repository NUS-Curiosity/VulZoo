Subject: New pagecache based sidechannel attack published

Hi,

https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/01/05/boffins_beat_page_cache/
https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01161

Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, Anders Fogh
have published a paper describing side channels attacks using OS pagecache statistics, allowing looking at
things like keystroke timing and others.

This affects not just Linux, but also Windows and potentially other OS.

Linux mainline patch:
  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=574823bfab82d9d8fa47f422778043fbb4b4f50e

I have requested a Linux specific CVE.

Ciao, Marcus
