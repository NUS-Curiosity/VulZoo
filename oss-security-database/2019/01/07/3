Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2018-1320 Announcement

Reported By: Sudheesh Katkam
Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation
Product: Apache Thrift
Problem Type: Improper Authentication
Versions Affected: Apache Thrift versions 0.5.0 through 0.11.0
Mitigation: Upgrading to the latest 0.12.0 release

Description:
Apache Thrift Java client library TSaslTransport can bypass SASL negotiation
isComplete validation. An assert was previously used to determine if the
SASL handshake had successfully completed, but in some cases this assertion
could be disabled in production settings making the validation incomplete.

Resolution:
The assertion has been removed and an isComplete check has
been moved within the handshake processing loop. The fix is contained
in the 0.12.0 Apache Thrift release.
