SECURITY-643
Users with permission to create or configure agents in Jenkins could
configure an EC2 agent to run arbitrary shell commands on the master node
whenever the agent was supposed to be launched.

Configuration of these agents now requires the 'Run Scripts' permission
typically only granted to administrators.
