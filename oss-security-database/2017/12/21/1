Hi,

This is just a heads up that I requested a CVE id for issue #30420[1]: gitlab
between 9.4 and before 9.4.2 does not verify the identity of the LDAP server.

This has been assigned CVE-2017-17716.

[1]https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/30420
(needless to say, this wasn't reported by me)

Cheers,
