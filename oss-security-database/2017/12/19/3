Hmm, I don't know about ssh, but you are supposed to export GPG_TTY in .bashrc.

I read that mail, and the guy doesn't make too much sense to me... Also, he
never showed any gpg-agent.conf file, or any debug output of gpg-agent. He only
claims is that it used to work on an Ubuntu system. So, how am I supposed to
help him? I never used anything Debian-related. 

Another issue, is that doing that sudo magic may not play well with
systemd-logind. Latest gnupg ships gpg-agent which is socket-activated by
systemd --user (FTR, I don't support this choice).

OTOH, this email is written in mutt running inside an ssh session, and the
passwd for the smtp server is stored in a symmetrically gpg-encrypted file...

What user runs gpg-agent?

The HUP signal is a standard means of making daemons reload their configs and
flush caches. gpg-agent is not unique here. For example, logrotate does the
same with syslog.

For encrypting you don't need agent at all. For example, on my systems, root
ssh key is set randomly on each boot and stored in an encrypted form. The
encryption is performed with my packager key as a --recipient. All from a
systemd service. Works since 2013 on Arch Linux testing.

For signing, I don't know what you mean because I don't understand how you
unlock secret key in a non-interactive manner...

Please, don't spread this corporate nonsense about production environments etc
because it is just a politically correct excuse for ignorance of IT ppl.
