Subject: CVE-2017-15124 Qemu: memory exhaustion through framebuffer update
 request message in VNC server

   Hello,

VNC server implementation in Quick Emulator(QEMU) was found to be vulnerable 
to an unbounded memory allocation issue, as it did not throttle the 
framebuffer updates sent to its client. If the client did not consume these 
updates, VNC server allocates growing memory to hold onto this data.

A malicious VNC client could use this flaw to cause DoS on the remote server 
host.
