Subject: [OSSA 2017-005.1] Nova Filter Scheduler bypass through rebuild action
 (CVE-2017-16239) ERRATA

====================================================================
OSSA-2017-005.1: Nova Filter Scheduler bypass through rebuild action
====================================================================

:Date: November 14, 2017
:CVE: CVE-2017-16239


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Nova: <=14.0.10, >=15.0.0 <=15.0.8, >=16.0.0 <=16.0.3


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
George Shuklin from servers.com reported a vulnerability in Nova. By
rebuilding an instance, an authenticated user may be able to
circumvent the Filter Scheduler bypassing imposed filters (for
example, the ImagePropertiesFilter or the IsolatedHostsFilter). All
setups using Nova Filter Scheduler are affected.


Errata
~~~~~~
The former fix introduced regressions in the rebuild functionality.
Rebuild may fail depending on configured scheduler filters and
environment, for example, when the compute host is running at capacity
or when the host is disabled. This update provides an additional set
of fixes for these regressions.
