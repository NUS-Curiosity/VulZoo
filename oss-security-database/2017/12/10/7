Prior art to consider and inform your decisions:

 * 0x9710B89BCA57AD7C -- PGP Global Directory Verification Key
   + Now part of Symantec; upload key, do verification steps via email,
     get signature
 * 0x2BAE3CF6DAFFB000 -- ct magazine -- pgpCA@...heise.de
   + Some years back a German technical magazine apparently made a big
     push to get people using OpenPGP and had their own verification
     service
 * WKS in the current (>= 2.1.15) GnuPG releases, built with optional
   ./configure flag, <https://wiki.gnupg.org/WKS>
   + Software to be run by the mail-provider for a given domain, to act
     as a trusted introducer and move away from the public keyservers.
     Like finger:// but without shell access to set .pubkey|.plan files.
     Requires a fair bit of setup, if nothing ships with support
     out-of-the-box.  Is one of the auto-key-locate options for GnuPG,
     under name `wkd`.  KMail has built-in support

Good luck!
