Subject: CVE-2017-1000407 Kernel: KVM: DoS via write flood to I/O port 0x80

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the KVM virtualization(CONFIG_KVM) support for the 
Intel processor family(CONFIG_KVM_INTEL), is vulnerable to a DoS issue. It 
could occur if a guest was to flood the I/O port 0x80 with write requests.

A guest user could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS.
