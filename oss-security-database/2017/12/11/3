SECURITY-663
Users with the ability to configure sandboxed Groovy scripts are able to
use a type coercion feature in Groovy to create new `File` objects from
strings. This allowed reading arbitrary files on the Jenkins master file
system.

Such a type coercion is now subject to sandbox protection and considered
to be a call to the `new File(String)` constructor for the purpose of
in-process script approval.
