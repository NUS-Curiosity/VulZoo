Yeah, this one keeps trying to get re-introduced as a "fix", when it
really isn't (see the archives of the stable@...r mailing list for
details.

I don't know how you can "reject" a CVE, is there a proceedure
somewhere?  There's lots of CVEs out there that people create against
the kernel that just aren't issues at all, but I've been ignoring them
as it makes people happy to assign and track them for no reason.

Is there some way a project can get them rejected?
