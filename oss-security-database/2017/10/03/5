As mentioned before, there is the cveform page at https://cveform.mitre.org/
which can be used to update CVEs, including asking for REJECT. Simply chose
"Request an update to an existing CVE entry" then in "Type of update
requested" please choose "Rejection".

AN EASY WAY TO INTERACT WITH CVE TO UPDATE/REJECT/ETC PLEASE IS TO USE THE
CVEFORM.
