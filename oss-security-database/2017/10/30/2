Thanks for publicizing this, it's an ancient issue, see e.g.

https://tomrobertshaw.net/2012/11/magento-security-check-your-appetclocal-xml-file/

I think it may finally be fixed in the 2.x series of Magento which now
has a "pub" directory beside "app" in the tree. With DocumentRoot =
"pub", your local.xml should be safe.

Indeed. And since you mentioned Drupal, they've done the same thing in
the past (search "code execution"):

https://www.drupal.org/forum/newsletters/security-advisories-for-drupal-core/2013-11-20/sa-core-2013-003-drupal-core

What's worse is that the Drupal status report will warn you about the
issue, but the "vulnerability check" that it does simply checks for the
existence of an .htaccess! So if you're running nginx and if you have
their impotent .htaccess file laying around, Drupal will tell you that
everything's OK.

(And of course, if you fix the issue properly, the status report will
tell you that you're vulnerable...)
