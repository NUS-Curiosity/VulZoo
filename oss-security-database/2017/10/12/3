Subject: CVE-2017-12192 kernel: NULL pointer dereference due to KEYCTL_READ on negative key


Gday,

A vulnerability in the Key Management sub component was found in the Linux
kernel. Trying to KEYTCL_READ on negative key would lead to a NULL pointer
dereference. A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the kernel.

It looks as though the read primitive is limited to a fixed address so this
has very limited use as an arbitrary read primitive to leverage for another
exploit.
