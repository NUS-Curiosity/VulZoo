Subject: Re: Fw: Security risk of vim swap files

It's not the fault of the program if an end-user insists upon use of a 
stupid configuration. There's no problem with VIM here IMO.

As others have said, your version control should ignore swap files, 
first of all, so they are not deployed.

If you do edit a file on the server, directly, then you should ensure 
proper configuration, which brings to the second point: you should put 
your swap/temp files into a directory that only you can control, like 
~/.vim/{backup/tmp} or ~/.local/tmp, etc...
