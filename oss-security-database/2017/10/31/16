I for one really dislike that for many years (i think .gconf and
all around that was the first time i recognized the problem) that
more and more programs think they can simply create a dot
directory in my $HOME.  Indeed i have started using umask 0077 due
to this.  I use "set dir=~/traffic" and "set backupdir=~/traffic"
and that has a mode of 0700.  My vim(s) has/ve never needed ~/.vim.
