Out of these, I think only 2 should be done: the files should be mode
0600 or 0400 even if the original file's permissions and/or the umask
are more relaxed.

1 and 3 go against intended use for these files - recovery of an edit in
progress if the editor or the entire system crashes (and comes back up
e.g. after a power-cycle).  /tmp contents might not survive a reboot,
and randomized filenames would prevent vim itself from detecting the
problem and offering recovery, which it does now.
