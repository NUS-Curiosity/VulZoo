It's also fairly absurd to insist that people can run whatever program
they want, wherever they want, on a production web server, without being
familiar enough with the program to understand the risks.

Anyone who edits files in the deployment path with an insufficient
education is going to have problems, and not having noswapfile set is
the least of them.
