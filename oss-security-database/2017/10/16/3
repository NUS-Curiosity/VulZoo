Subject: distros list downtime

Hi,

The (linux-)distros lists were down for almost 3 days because of a
software issue, providing a 4xx SMTP error code in response to attempted
incoming message deliveries.  The problem is corrected now.  Some
messages sent during this time period might get through with a delay as
the senders' servers will retry deliveries.  Some others, if any, might
have timed out by now.

If you sent anything that is still relevant to (linux-)distros during
the last 3 days, please consider resending.

Alexander
