As this states explicitly a 'CVE request' on the subject. Please note
that CVEs cannot be requested anymore via the oss-security list,
instead please fill the form at https://cveform.mitre.org/ 

Once you got CVEs assigned, can you please post those assignment
following up here on your original post to have the other members of
this list informed on the assignment.

Thanks for your contribution!

Regards,
Salvatore
