Subject: Stored XSS vulnerability in ILIAS <= 5.2.8 and <= 5.1.20

Hi,

I've discovered a security issue in ILIAS <= 5.2.8 and <= 5.1.20
(https://www.ilias.de)


A stored XSS vulnerability in the media object component allows an
authenticated user to inject JavaScript to gain administrator privileges.


Fix:
https://github.com/ILIAS-eLearning/ILIAS/commit/b2a4660afec1e87d41c83c8e381f549bc6dfc70f


The issue is fixed in ILIAS 5.2.9 and 5.1.21.

I've requested a CVE ID (MITRE).
