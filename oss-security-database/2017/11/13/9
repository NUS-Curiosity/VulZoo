Ah, will look into that soon then.

It is calculated from first report on distros list, that said, for
CVE-2017-1000255 there was some missing data for first publication (it
is public through
https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2017-1000255 and
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101264 since 9th), so the publication
time is 5.97 days (although not for oss-security posting).

That should be the data already used.
