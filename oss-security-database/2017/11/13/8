Please feel free to create a page like:

You don't need any special access for that.

Thank you, Kristian!

This lists two very long embargo periods for two Linux kernel issues: 96
days for CVE-2017-7533 and 28 days for CVE-2017-1000255.  While this is
useful info, it does not reflect (linux-)distros' lists performance as
it includes embargo periods from prior to disclosure to those lists.
Also, we can't reliably know of such prior embargo periods, so our data
would be inconsistent, which is especially bad for calculating averages.

I think for our statistics collection, we should primarily use embargo
periods since disclosure to (linux-)distros' lists, and secondarily
since the possibly earlier embargo start dates when known (like you did
now).  Can you add such data?
