Subject: (linux-)distros list use statistics

Hi,

I think it's time for Gentoo and/or Amazon to share with all of us the
statistics they should have collected so far as per:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros#contributing-back

"13. Keep track of per-report and per-issue handling and disclosure
timelines (at least times of notification of the private list and of
actual public disclosure), at regular intervals produce and share
statistics (most notably, the average embargo duration) as well as the
raw data (except on issues that are still under embargo) by posting to
oss-security - primary: Gentoo, backup: Amazon"

Please do.

Thanks,

Alexander
