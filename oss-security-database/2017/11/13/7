Hi,

As far as I'm aware I haven't gotten access to edit the wiki page for
publishing it. But the stats Gentoo has recorded are as follows (graph
attached);

Date                                    All
Number of reports                       24
Average embargo time (first public)     10.44
Average embargo time (oss-security)     10.63

This is based on the following monthly data:
2017-06	2017-07	2017-08	2017-09	2017-10
1	3	6	9	5
10.84	34.16	6.39	5.83	9.30
14.16	34.50	6.39	5.84	9.31

The wikified stats based on the generated DocuWiki output is available
in very basic style at the testing instance:

https://wiki.sumptuouscapital.com/doku.php?id=distros_stats

but this deserves a more fitting home (e.g the width isn't a problem on
the wider template) :)
