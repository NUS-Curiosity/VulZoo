Subject: Information Leak in mincore() in the Linux Kernel CVE-2017-16994

Hi,

Mitre has allocated CVE-2017-16994 for this bug found by Google P0 team member jannh.

The walk_hugetlb_range function in mm/pagewalk.c in the Linux kernel before 4.14.2 mishandles holes in hugetlb ranges, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized kernel memory via crafted use of the mincore() system call.
