Yes, I am not saying there is no room for improvement here.

I don't buy that argument. There are at least 2 problems here. Someone 
misconfiguring his webserver so it does serve dotfiles and secondly 
making some last minute changes on a live production server (and 
thirdly, the Vim session must have crashed). That sounds more like an 
user error. Also the other example about deleting the file that is 
currently being edited is not very convincing.

But please, if you really want to change how the swap files are created 
please comment here:
