It's strange it's using /var/tmp instead of ~/.cache but at least it can
be protected with PAM's per-user isolated directory support rather than
relying on it being done securely.

In /etc/security/namespace.conf, for per-user isolated /tmp and /var/tmp:

    /tmp     /tmp-inst/     level
    /var/tmp /var/tmp-inst/ level

In /etc/pam.d/system-auth:

    session   required  pam_namespace.so

Likely also want to mount /tmp-inst as tmpfs (mode=000) if /tmp was
tmpfs rather than just using the root directory pam will create.
