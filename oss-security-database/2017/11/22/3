Hi there,

Is this fuzzer freely available?  I'd love to try it out on the bignum
support I added to the CHICKEN Scheme implementation for its upcoming
new major release (probably somewhere mid-2018).  Being able to release
it with a bit higher confidence in its correctness would be nice, as this
is almost all brand new code.

Cheers,
Peter Bex (CHICKEN core maintainer)
