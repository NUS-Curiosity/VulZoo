The commit for the arbitrary file read vulnerability mentioned in the
Gentoo bug report is actually this one:

https://github.com/phusion/passenger/commit/4043718264095cde6623c2cbe8c644541036d7bf

I'm not sure if the other commit was fixing an actual flaw or just
intended as hardening.

Passenger switches IDs to the user that's supposed to run the passenger
application. The problem we reported was that some of the application
data was read and stored before the ID switching took place.
