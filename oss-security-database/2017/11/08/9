Subject: Back in Time: CVE-2017-16667: shell injection in notify-send

Hi

MITRE has assinged CVE-2017-16667 for the following isue in Back in
Time, "a simple backup tool for Linux". backintime is prone to a shell
injection vulnerability via notify-sent.

Back in Time did improper escaping/quoting of file paths used as
arguments to the 'notify-send' command, leading to some parts of file
paths being executed as shell commands.

An attacker could take advantage of this flaw by crafting an
unreadable file with a specific name to run arbitrary shell commands.

Upstream report: https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/issues/834
Fixed by: https://github.com/bit-team/backintime/commit/cef81d0da93ff601252607df3db1a48f7f6f01b3

Regards,
Salvatore
