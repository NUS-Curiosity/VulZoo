Is it not the kernel's responsibility to enforce umask(2) is properly
applied?

My umask(3p) includes:

       The file mode creation mask of the process is used to turn
       off permission bits in the mode argument supplied during
       calls to the following functions:

        *  open(), openat(), creat(), mkdir(), mkdirat(), mkfifo(),
           and mkfifoat()

        *  mknod(), mknodat()

        *  mq_open()

        *  sem_open()

Obviously there's good case to be made that manual chmod(2) calls could
or should be modified by umask(2) values by hand, but probably all those
chmod(2) calls ought to be re-written to set the modes correctly at file
creation time (or mkdir, etc) to avoid race conditions.

Thanks
