Another approach would be to actually whitelist the file types/patterns
that are delivered by your web servers. We have seen various file types
during testing since a long time that should not have been web served
and compiled a list [1] of those:

.dot files in general. In particular:
 .ht*
 .DS_Store
 .git*
 .svn*
.pkcs12 .pfx .p12, .pem, .key, .der, .crt
*.log
*.swp
*.bp/*.bak
/^~/ or /~$/
*.dmp/*.core
thumbs.db/*.db
*.raw
*.sqlite
*.conf/*.ini
*.txt/*.csv

However, I also fully agree with the comments later in the thread that
this issue should mainly be addressed by strict operating standards for
production systems as well as deployment procedures.

Best,
Matthias
