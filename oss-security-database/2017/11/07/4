Subject: Net::Ping::External command injections

Hi,

Net::Ping::External [0] is prone to command injection vulnerabilities.

The issues are roughly 10 (!) years old [1], but the code is still being
shipped these days (e.g. in ubuntu artful and debian stretch [2]).

I had contacted the author of the code a few days ago, but obviously did
not get any reaction.

A patch is available here:

  http://matthias.sdfeu.org/devel/net-ping-external-cmd-injection.patch

Maybe time to just patch it downstream? Or drop this pkg. altogether?

Thanks,
Matthias
