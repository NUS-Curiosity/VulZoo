Ah, great :) I've been using sshd and ssh as a sudo replacement on all
machines, inspired by your old article about insecurities of the latter (with
locked root password, so su also doesn't work). Of course, sshd is in general
listens on localhost:22. As for the keys, the keypair to access root, as well
as root's authorized_keys file, are generated at each boot and stored in tmpfs.

Thanks for the idea,
