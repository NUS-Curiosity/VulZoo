Subject: Django security releases issued: 1.11.5 and 1.10.8

Today the Django team issued 1.11.5 and 1.10.8 as part of our security 
process. These releases address a security issue, and we encourage all 
users to upgrade as soon as possible:

https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2017/sep/05/security-releases/

As a reminder, we ask that potential security issues be reported via 
private email to security@...ngoproject.com and not via Django's Trac 
instance or the django-developers list. Please see 
https://www.djangoproject.com/security for further information.
