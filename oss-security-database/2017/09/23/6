Having access to the embargoed information allowed us (Ubuntu) to evaluate the
impact of the issue, look at the fix, and start locally testing the fix to
determine if there were any issues. It also allows us to properly assign
resources to working on the update.

It would have probably taken us more than a day to publish this update if we
didn't have access to the information in advance.

For issues that aren't critical, we tend to wait until the upstream project
commits the fix before we release updates, to make sure a last-minute adjustment
or additional fix didn't get added.

Yes, I believe the pre-disclosure was helpful to us. Thanks for doing it.
