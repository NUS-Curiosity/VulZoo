Subject: tcpdump 4.9.2 is fully available

Hello all.

As per Alexander's advice, let me comment for the avoidance of doubt that all deliverables for the tcpdump 4.9.2 release are public since today as advised last week. This includes individual commits in the public git repository with reference to particular CVE IDs and credits to the original reporter(s) and the author of each bugfix.

To report a new security issue (segfault, buffer overflow, infinite loop, arbitrary code execution etc) with tcpdump or libpcap please send an e-mail to security@...dump.org, do not use the public bug tracker.

Thank you.
