I did not mean that the CVE itself is "hearsay".  What I meant is the 
way an upstream maintainer is informed about a CVE is often no better 
than "hearsay".  In some cases the information comes from someone who 
is already known and trusted while in other cases it is impossible to 
even tell who is providing the information since the person providing 
the information has intentionally obfusticated their identity.

If an upstream maintainer reports that a release resolves a particular 
CVE, then he could easily have provided wrong information given that 
the upstream maintainer does not have access to the technical details 
of the report and analysis which initiated the CVE and may confuse one 
issue with another.

It may be that the upstream maintainer fixes a problem and some weeks 
later the CVE is created related to the problem which was fixed.

The database entries do not contain enough information for an upstream 
maintainer to identify one issue from another similar issue.  They 
only contain sanitized information.
