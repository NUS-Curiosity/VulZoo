Nope. To quote the web site: 'Open Source software security discussions "
http://www.openwall.com/lists/ the fact that it has turned into a security
announce list with limited discussion is  just how things go I guess. Also
it's tough because the Linux Kernel has explicitly said they won't get
CVE's for all their security issues, they simply fix and move on, their
culture is "run something current, if not, to bad" (which part of me agrees
with, but that doesn't work so well for IoT/enterprise/people needing a
high degree of stability/assurance).

There are commercial security information vendors that claim to provide
this, I won't name names as I don't know how good they are. Step 1 here for
the open source community would be making sure Kernel issues get CVEs, and
then that those CVEs get into the CVE database so people are aware of them.
