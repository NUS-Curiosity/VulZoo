Define "all" :)

Anyway, as many people know, there are various reasons why the kernel
security team works the way it works, let's not debate that issue again
please.

But it turns out it's not all written down anywhere in one place, for
people to easily understand, so I've started to do so.  I'm giving a
talk about this very topic tomorrow at a conference, and should be
turning it into a document sometime in the near future that I will
publish somewhere.

thanks,
