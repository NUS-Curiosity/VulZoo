FWIW, for GNU Guix (which doesn’t have anyone yet on the distros list),
we pushed the patch less than 30 minutes after the public disclosure on
oss-sec¹.

The fact that your message to oss-sec was very clear on the issue and
its consequences, and contained a link to the (small) patch surely made
it easier to prepare the fix.
