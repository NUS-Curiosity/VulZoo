Subject: Stored XSS vulnerability in eGroupware Community Edition <=
 16.1.20170703

Hi,

there is a security issue in eGroupware Community Edition <=
16.1.20170703 (https://github.com/EGroupware/egroupware)


Stored XSS vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to
inject JavaScript via Browser User-Agent which is triggered by the
application administrator.

Fix:
https://github.com/EGroupware/egroupware/commit/0ececf8c78f1c3f9ba15465f53a682dd7d89529f


The issue is fixed in eGroupware Community Edition 16.1.20170922.


Until now vendor has not marked the new version as security update and
also not mentioned the security issue.
(https://github.com/EGroupware/egroupware/releases/tag/16.1.20170922)


I've requested a CVE ID (MITRE) but I have not received any yet.
