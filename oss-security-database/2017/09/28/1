This is defintively not "exhaustive", and not exactly what you are
pointing out. I thought it might be still of help, so I quickly looked
what we know in our kernel-sec repository tracking as well fixed which
are "needed" yet in 4.9:

CVE-2017-0605:
--------------
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0605
upstream: (4.12-rc1) [e09e28671cda63e6308b31798b997639120e2a21]

is e.g. includedin 3.16.44 (a1141b19b23a0605d46f3fab63fd2d76207096c4),
3.2.89 (e39e64193a8a611d11d4c62579a7246c1af70d1c) but not in 4.9.

(afaics not Cc'ed to stable).

CVE-2017-12154:
---------------
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12154
from https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&m=150640182829622&w=2

upstream: released (4.14-rc1) [51aa68e7d57e3217192d88ce90fd5b8ef29ec94f]

AFAICS, not Cc'ed to stable.

CVE-2017-14156:
---------------
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14156
upstream: released (4.14-rc1) [8e75f7a7a00461ef6d91797a60b606367f6e344d]

CVE-2017-1000252:
-----------------
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000252
The reaon that there is no Cc to stable might have been actually a
safety guard to not sent out the commit to a public list, but not
sure.

upstream: released (4.14-rc1) [3a8b0677fc6180a467e26cc32ce6b0c09a32f9bb]

Hope this might be of help.

Regards,
Salvatore
