Subject: CSRF vulnerability in Tiki <= 17.0, 16.2, 15.4 LTS and 12.11 LTS

Hi,

there are two security issues in Tiki <= 17.0, 16.2, 15.4 LTS and 12.11
LTS (https://tiki.org)


Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via IMG tag allows an
authenticated user to gain administrator privileges if an administrator
opens a wiki page with the IMG tag.

Fix:
https://sourceforge.net/p/tikiwiki/code/63829


Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability via IMG tag allows an
authenticated user to edit global permissions if an administrator opens
a wiki page with the IMG tag. For example, an attacker could assign
administrator privileges to every unauthenticated user of the site.

Fix:
https://sourceforge.net/p/tikiwiki/code/63872


Both issues are fixed in Tiki 17.1, Tiki 16.3, Tiki 15.5 LTS and Tiki
12.12 LTS.
