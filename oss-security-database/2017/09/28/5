Yes, fair enough, you are right.  Those cases do exist, this one fell
through the cracks, which will always happen, we are all human, even Al :)

I don't have access to my email archives at the moment, but I _think_
this one was my fault as it was on my list of things "go look at", and I
never go to it in time.  My current list of patches that fall into that
category is rather large, due to my recent travels, hopefully I'll catch
up on that by the end of this month.

I always suggest that if I do miss things, please let me know through
whatever way you want to (public list, security@k.o, private email,
poking me on irc, taking me out to drinks, etc.)

thanks,
