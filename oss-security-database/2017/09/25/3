Subject: Re: CVE-2017-14489: Linux kernel: scsi: nlmsg is not
 properly parsed in iscsi_if_rx()

heololo,

an additional research shows that the very latest kernels are not showing
a crash with a reproducer. git bisect showed that:

commit 7f564528a480084e2318cd48caba7aef4a54a77f (between v4.11 and v4.12-rc1)
is the first commit a crash is not reproduced with:

commit 7f564528a480084e2318cd48caba7aef4a54a77f
Author: Steffen Klassert <steffen.klassert@...unet.com>
Date:   Sat Apr 8 20:36:24 2017 +0200
skbuff: Extend gso_type to unsigned int.

i.e. this is commit which fixed the crash. checking the code, it looks like
struct skb_shared_info's fields were reordered, so a field which overwrite
was causing a panic has been moved. nevertheless, the buffer overwrite is still
there, so a suggested patch 9923803 (or its later version) is still needed.

for a proof compare a flaw description:

> ev = nlmsg_data(nlh) will acutally get skb_shinfo(SKB) instead and set a
> new value to skb_shinfo(SKB)->nr_frags by ev->type.

and the commit message:

>    The remaining two byte hole is moved to the
>    beginning of the structure, this protects us
>    from immediate overwites on out of bound writes
>    to the sk_buff head.
