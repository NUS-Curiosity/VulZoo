This pre-disclosure interval is extremely useful.  We may not, in
general, publish a patch quite as soon after disclosure that I would
like but that doesn't mean we have ignored the pre-disclosure or taken
no action.

While it may not be readily apparent, the distros list does allow us to
get our act together so that when customers come knocking asking "what's
this security problem all about then?" we have answers prepared.  It'll
never be perfect, but I'd like to think we're all getting better at this.
