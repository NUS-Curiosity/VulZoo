While I understand you not wanting to post to a public mailing list
right away, why exactly would you have wanted a longer embargo than e.g.
linux-distros' maximum of 14 days?

You're probably referring to the Linux kernel security list.  7 days
sounds like a reasonable embargo period to me, but if you really wanted
more, you could get up to 14 by first contacting linux-distros only, and
then bringing the issue to the Linux kernel security list in no more
than 7 days to the planned public disclosure.

I hope you will only go for a longer embargo when there's actually a
good reason for that.  There might or might not have been in this case.
