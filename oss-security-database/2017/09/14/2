Subject: mp3gain: NULL pointer dereference in sync_buffer (mpglibDBL/interface.c)

Description:
mp3gain is a program to analyze and adjust MP3 files to same volume.

The fuzz was done via the aacgain command-line tool which uses mp3gain which bundles an old-modified version of mpg123 called mpglibDBL.
The upstream project seems to be dead, so the issue wasnâ€™t communicated to them.

The complete ASan output of the issue:

# aacgain -f $FILE
ASAN:DEADLYSIGNAL
