Subject: Shibboleth plugin for WordPress: CVE-2017-14313: XSS vulnerability
 due to improper use of add_query_arg()

Hi

MITRE has assigned CVE-2017-14313 for the following cross-site
scripting vulnerability in the Shibboleth plugin for Wordpress, caused
due improper use of add_query_arg(), found in the
shibboleth_login_form function in shibboleth.php.

Decided to still forward the assignment here to the list even as
Dominic mentioned the issue was long known already, but apparently at
least never reported in Debian.

Only now a CVE was requested, triggered by the bugreport in Debian:

https://bugs.debian.org/874416

Upstream fix (contained in 1.8):

https://github.com/michaelryanmcneill/shibboleth/commit/1d65ad6786282d23ba1865f56e2fd19188e7c26a

Regards,
Salvatore
