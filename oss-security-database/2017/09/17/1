Subject: [OSSN-0081] sha512_crypt is insufficient for password hashing

sha512_crypt is insufficient for password hashing
-------------------------------------------------

### Summary ###

Use of sha512_crypt for password hashing in versions of Keystone prior
to Pike, is insufficient and provides limited protection against
brute-forcing of password hashes.

### Affected Services / Software ###
OpenStack Identity Service (Keystone). OpenStack Releases Ocata, Newton.

### Discussion ###

Keystone uses sha512_crypt for password hashing. This provides
insufficient and limited protection, since sha512_crypt algorithm has a
low computational cost factor, therefore making it easier to crack
passwords offline in a short period of time.

The correct mechanism is to use the more secure hashing algorithms with
a higher computational cost factor such as bcrypt, scrypt, or
pbkdf2_sha512 instead of sha512_crypt.

### Recommended Actions ###

It is recommended that operators upgrade to the Pike release where all
future passwords would be bcrypt hashed.

Operators should also force password changes on all users [1], which
will result in the users newly generated passwords being bcrypt hashed.
