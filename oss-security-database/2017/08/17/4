Yes, apologies, I should have noted that.

Well, it has to be a service of the same type.  If you can control the key
for host/foo.example.com and poison DNS, you can masquerade as
host/bar.example.com, but it does you no good for masquerading as
nfs/bar.example.com.  But yes, certainly still a bad thing.

Oh, certainly, I agree.

Well... I'm not making the assertion that the implementations don't do
this, only that they don't support the same configuration options.  I
haven't verified how Heimdal handles DNS canonicalization, only that it
doesn't use those krb5.conf options.  It's more of an aside to warn people
that just turning off those options may not be adequate.
