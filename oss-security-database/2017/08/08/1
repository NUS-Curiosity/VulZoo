JENKINS-46007
The SAML Plugin stored passwords unencrypted as part of its configuration. 
This allowed users with Jenkins master local file system access and Jenkins 
administrators to retrieve the stored password. The latter could result in 
exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting 
vulnerabilities, etc.
