Really?  What kernel version are you looking at?  The latest kernel tree
shows this, from the repo you link to above:
  https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/media/pci/bt8xx/bttv-driver.c#L2098

what am I missing here?

Also, any specific reason you sent this to oss-security just a few
minutes after sending it to security@...nel.org?  I don't really care
for something like this that is not really an issue, but if it was,
well, you sure didn't give anyone a chance to actually fix it :)

thanks,
