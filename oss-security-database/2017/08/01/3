Subject: Syslog forwarding with IP spoofing

Good day!


I need to recive syslog messages, filter them and send them forward to the SIEM.

Also HOST field is not represented in syslog, so i need to spoof IP of forwarding
packets to bind messages recived by SIEM to it's original source IP.

If i will try to add some marks to syslog message, I will need to override
parsers for each syslog source type, so it seems like abad idea.

Is there any open source tool for that task?
