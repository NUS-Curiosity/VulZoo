I would strongly suggest that people notify distros@ (keeping in mind it
has a 2 week embargo limit, so if you need more than that, don't notify
distros@ until you are ready) and notify the Kernel (we want this fixed
upstream too,obviously, but also keeping in mind that they have a 1 week
embargo limit, so if you need more than that, don't notify the Kernel until
you are ready). Another option it to notify a vendor such as Red Hat (
secalert@...hat.com) or SUSE (security@...e.com) as we can handle things in
house (we have kernel devs/etc) and we know whom to notify at other vendors
as needed (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) and can hold embargoes as needed
(although typically we don't like long embargoes either, I would say 4-5
weeks absolute max ideally).

Another benefit of notifying the vendors/distros is we can help with the
coordination and notification, CVEs, etc. Kernel upstream basically just
fixes it and moves on (which is legitimate, it's not their job to make sure
every possible downstream gets notified*)

[*] although it would be nice if this stuff gets a CVE and the CVE gets
used, then people know to pay attention to those commits/etc.
