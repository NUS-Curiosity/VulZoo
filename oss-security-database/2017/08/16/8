I think this overstates the impact somewhat.  This is more worrisome with
TLS because for most TLS applications there is a single global trust
domain with certificates issued by dozens or hundreds of parties and no
organizational scoping.  This is *not* the case for Kerberos.  To exploit
this flaw in Kerberos, the attacker has to be able to control service
principals (for the same target service with a different hostname) within
the same Kerberos realm (or, in some circumstances, one reachable by
cross-realm trust).  This is a much higher bar to meet, and in a lot of
organizations this bar cannot be easily met by an attacker.

The attack is definitely possible, and the Kerberos community has been
aware of this problem for a long time (there are a lot of difficult issues
involved in closing it, but everyone has wanted to close it), but it's not
as exploitable as the TLS equivalent (at least in the absence of
organizational cert pinning).

For the record, those are settings for *a* Kerberos client library, not
*the* Kerberos client library (specifically, the MIT Kerberos
implementation).  Heimdal does not use those settings, and there are other
Kerberos implementations as well.
