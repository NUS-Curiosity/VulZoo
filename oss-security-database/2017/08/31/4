Subject: CVE request: incorrect URL parsing in async-http-client <= 2.0.35

Hello,

a flaw was identified in the URL parsing code of async-http-client, a
Java HTTP client used in other projects like the Play Framework
(through its WS library):
https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/JavaWS

The bug is similar to CVE-2016-8624 affecting cURL (incorrect
processing of string "#@" in the hostname):
https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20161102J.html

Version 2.0.35 of async-http-client includes a fix and is available
through Maven since Monday. Relevant GitHub issue:
https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client/issues/1455

Regards,
Nicolas Grégoire
