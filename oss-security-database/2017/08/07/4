Do memory-exhaustion bugs get a CVE?  Suppose an application is fooled
into requesting 2Gb of memory but then never uses it other than
attempting to read it, immediately hitting EOF, and cleaning up.

I'm addressing such a bug in libpng right now, in which the user
is sent a PNG file containing a tEXt chunk that claims to have a 2GB
length (but none of the 2GB data is included in the PNG).  On my
platform libpng deals with that almost instantaneously, but I think
some platforms (ASAN builds?) would actually allocate the memory
before proceeding to read the data.
