Chris Evans' report (copied in the email you replied to) says this:

GraphicsMagick vs. ImageMagick, again. Well, well, look at this :)
GraphicsMagick fixed this issue in March 2016, for the v1.3.24 release, tucked
away in a changeset titled "Fix SourceForge bug #371 "out-of-bounds read in
coders/rle.c:633:39" (see the second memset()). This is another case where tons
of vulnerabilities are being found and fixed in both GraphicsMagick and
ImageMagick with little co-ordination. This seems like a waste of effort and a
risk of 0-day (or is it 1-day?) exposure. It goes both ways: the RLE memory
corruption I referenced in my previous blog post was only fixed in
GraphicsMagick in March 2016, having been previously fixed in ImageMagick in
Dec 2014.
