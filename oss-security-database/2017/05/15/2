Subject: CVE-2017-7495 kernel : information leak on ext4 when hardware reset.

When a power failure (or hardware reset) occurs, applications writing to an
ext4 filesystem system may create a situation in which writes to one file
may appear in another file (ergo information leak).

This may be at least data corruption, a controlled attacker may be able to
leverage this to steal data from writes to the same ext4 subsystem.
