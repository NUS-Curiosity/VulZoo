Subject: CVE-2017-8379 Qemu: input: host memory lekage via keyboard

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the keyboard input event handlers support is 
vulnerable to a host memory leakage issue. It could occur if a guest user was 
to generate large keyboard events, faster than Qemu could process them.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to exhaust host memory, 
resulting in DoS.
