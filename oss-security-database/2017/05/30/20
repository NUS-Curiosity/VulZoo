Red Hat is only associated with this in so far as I happen to work for Red
Hat and I typically do the CVE assignments on the distros@ list (where this
issue was initially reported).

I suggest you take this issue up with MITRE/CVE Board (disclaimer: I'm also
on the CVE Board), they control CVE and the definitions of what is CVE
worthy, and in this case it largely falls under the "advertised/implied
security feature doesn't work as such". This is unlikely to change as it's
well established and has been used for over a decade.

I suggest then you take this up with the original researcher if you're
worried about people padding their CVs. This discussion isn't
productive/helpful and I suggest you take it off list.
