We did this 3 years ago:

https://cve.mitre.org/cve/identifiers/syntaxchange.html

Examples

Examples of identifiers in the new CVE ID syntax are included below.
There is no limit on the number of arbitrary digits. Leading 0’s will
only be used in IDs 1 to 999, as shown in column one below.

IDs with 4 digits	IDs with 5 digits	IDs with 6 digits	IDs with 7 digits
CVE-2014-0001	CVE-2014-10000	CVE-2014-100000	CVE-2014-1000000
CVE-2014-3127	CVE-2014-54321	CVE-2014-456132	CVE-2014-7654321
CVE-2014-9999	CVE-2014-99999	CVE-2014-999999	CVE-2014-9999999
NOTE: Some of the CVE ID examples above have not yet been assigned.

The DWF CNA has the block CVE-YEAR-1000000 through CVE-YEAR-1999999 so
yes, these are legitimate. E.g.:

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-1000001
