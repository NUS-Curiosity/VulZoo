Linux isn't impacted in a security-relevant way by these bugs. You're
claiming that some downstream code is implemented in a way that impacts
security, but you can't explain how it compromises a meaningful security
boundary.

Nothing in Linux claims to work the way you're talking about. You've
only brought up an incomplete implementation of verified boot based on a
fork of the Linux kernel. It should be filed against that fork, but it
really doesn't make any sense to have a CVE for a non-security feature
being broken.

I'm not just concerned about people padding their CVs, I'm concerned
about vendors marketing incomplete snake oil as an implementation of
security features that actually have a meaning and then turning it into
nonsense like this.

I suggest taking discussions about non-security bugs off list. It's not
on topic here.
