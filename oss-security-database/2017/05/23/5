You can still do this. oss-security is a list run by Solar Designer
(openwall.com). I happen to be a long time poster/moderator, but I have
no official control/etc (I don't even block posts, that's up to solar, I
just allow stuff or ignore it when it's up for moderation).

The DWF will not be taking CVE requests on oss-security (ditto for
MITRE/etc.), why? They're way to messy. We need well structured requests
i we want this to scale (I should know, I've done over 5000 CVE
assignments). One goal is to get CVE assignments down to minutes with
minimal latency (e.g. a large pool of assigners so timezones aren't a
problem). This stuff can then be posted to oss-security WITH a CVE.

Or you can post it to oss-security WITHOUT a CVE (like you did in past)
and still have all the discussion. The only change is if you want a CVE
you hav to fill out a simple form and wait a bit. You had to wait when
you posted here so the waiting part hasn't changed much. (well ok, right
now the DWF is slow, but again I'm working on that).

I disagree. If not assigning CVE's on the list kills this list, then...
wow. Good to know I personally kept this list up and running for a few
years.

Which README specifically (there's a bunch), feel free to reply offlist.
