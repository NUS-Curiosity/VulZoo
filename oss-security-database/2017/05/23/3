Neither, that's part of what I'm figuring out. Most likely it'll look
like a trusted pool of people (aka CVE Mentors) that can either
contribute or more easily gatekeep). Also the doc are out of date and
the process is evolving rapidly so I haven't really bothered updating
them since things keep changing.

Good question. What exactly is it you want to input? CVE requests? CVE
assignments? Modify existing CVE entries?

Not really. the docs are out of date and I'm more concerned about
evolving this right now then updating documentation.
