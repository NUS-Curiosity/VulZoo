There can't be an assessment without knowledge of what to assess - there
is little to no information in your mail. I can only guess that somebody
for the hundredth time found out that terminals are more than dumb
display devices and got excited that, somehow, this might be a security
issue. Without knowing details, I can't say for sure, but most likely,
this is a security issue the same way blindly feeding unknown commands to
your shell is, i.e., it's a problem somewhere else - the protocol between
terminals and programs is not a (strong) security barrier.

(your echo command is bash-specific, btw.)
