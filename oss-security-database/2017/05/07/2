This article purposely uses a litany of poor programming practices to 
expose an alleged exploit in PHP mail().. I'd like to see the same 
exploit, without assuming the developer on the software had no idea what 
they're doing (passing non-sanitized variables to functions). As well, 
you noted in your own article that this 'discovery' was first published 
in 2011 by someone else.
