Subject: Re: Integer Overflow in rxvt

Hi folks,

Just a small update on this. Gentoo has moved forward with removing
rxvt from our distribution [1]. I'd recommend other distributions
follow, since every use case of rxvt is handled by rxvt-unicode, and
rxvt has no upstream anymore, in addition to what sounds like likely
more vulnerabilities.

Regards,
Jason
