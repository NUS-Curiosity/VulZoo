OK, let's do it this way: you list some tasks and say whether you'd like
to be "primary" or "backup" for them (could be different for each task),
and we find other distros to fill the other role for each task.

Other distros are welcome to state what they volunteer for in the same
way: choose "primary" or "backup", as long as neither is taken yet.

OK.  (If tasks are gone, we may nevertheless find some for you, but
you'll have less freedom of choice.)

Thanks,
