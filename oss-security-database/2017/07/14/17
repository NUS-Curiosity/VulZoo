Subject: Re: accepting new members to (linux-)distros lists

Sorry I thought I'd replied earlier to this thread (phone email clients,
how do they work?) Red Hat will continue to help (let's pick #1 and #2
explicitly), I know we already have more than 2 people on the list so I
don't think we need to nominate a backup?
