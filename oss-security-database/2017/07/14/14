As a metric it likely doesn't provide much though; a high number of
tracked issues are fixed without GLSA, depending on severity and
expected install base of the package, and multiple fixes are combined
into single GLSAs if related to same package etc, so as a metric it is
probably quite bad and number depending on factors such as available
manpower from year to year.
