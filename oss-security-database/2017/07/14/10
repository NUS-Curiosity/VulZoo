You may want to look at[1] for the case of ArchLinux. Do consider the
caveat brought up by other people on the list: CVE numbers are not a 1:1
mapping to bugs (or even exploitable bugs). For example, there are
vendors that group all bugs discovered in a period (or with a conceputal
similarity) under one CVE number, whereas others take mutliple
variations of a bug and request an individual CVE for each. Needless to
say, some bugs never get a CVE ;).

You could use the json api[2] on [1] to get a rolling count if you'd like
to measure this (also pasted on [3]]):

>>> import json, requests
>>> response = requests.get("https://security.archlinux.org/vulnerable/json")
>>> data = json.loads(response.content)
>>> len(data)
34

Cheers!
