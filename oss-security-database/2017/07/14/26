 vulnerability in CBT handler

Hi,

When I saw this and the proposed fix (the backport fix, not the one in
git head), which was to remove tar support, but leave the command line
calling of all the other tools looked suspicious to me.

I played around a while, I haven't been able to find any more command
injections. However I discussed this with Tobias Müller and he found
out that another evince backend - the dvi one - also calls a shell
command with insufficient escaping:

While I didn't find any more command injections, I figured out that
with a password protected zip file as a cbz one can cause evince to
hang:
