And therein lies the problem.  "0day" and "7up" are valid user names
according to Posix[1], they may or may not exist, but they are valid.
You may think Posix is wrong to allow an initial digit, but that isn't
the issue.  The problem is that systemd treats an "invalid" username as
either an integer or not specified and in either case this results in a
program running as the wrong user, probably as root.

Having systemd balk at what Posix considers to be a valid username is a
bug that systemd is free to say "this is stupid, we're not allowing
that".   If, as appears to be the case, systemd says "that username is
stupid, we're going to interpret it differently" then that's when we
need a CVE because, to my mind on this hot and sunny say, that's systemd
apparently doing something for security that it is not.
