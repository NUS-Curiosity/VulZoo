Should systemd really valid usernames?  I would think that you would 
either use getpwnam(username) and if that fails you may then parse it as a 
numeric value.  If "0day" isn't a valid username according to getpwnam(), 
when converting it to a numeric uid should *also* fail because "0day" 
isn't a properly numeric value.
