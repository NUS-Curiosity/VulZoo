The systemd mailing list is indexed by major search engines. I
deliberately didn't provide a link, in the hope that a small barrier to
entry will lead to fewer responses reiterating what has already been said,
and a correspondingly greater chance of a response not getting lost in
the noise from someone who has read the context and will propose a
patch that achieves the desired result without breaking intended
functionality (in particular "graceful degradation" when units released
in upstream projects are interpreted by an older systemd, so that
upstreams can opt-in to new security hardening flags without making their
software inoperable in currently-deployed systemd versions).

Of course, if I was an exemplary open source developer I would have been
spending my free time on writing that patch instead of getting drawn into
conversations on oss-security, so perhaps this is partially my fault now.
