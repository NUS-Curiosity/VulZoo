Thanks for your reply and clearing this up. One of the points in my email was
that this is not documented in the DWF item well enough. There is
description_data with value, but no referer to oss-security, which should also
use those issue numbers. Should the assigner or requester post this information
to oss-security aswell or is the point that DWF is followed via GitHub with
custom scripts? If someone makes a pull request to the item is the information
populated to MITRE and NVD databases and how often?
