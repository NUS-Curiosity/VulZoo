Subject: Re: CoreOS membership to linux-distros (updated)

Additionally, Docker doesn't maintain a kernel distribution, whereas OpenVZ does, making this request strange to say the least.

I also think its disingenuous to imply there's "one patch" that divides a secure containerization system from another. Container/Kernel security is... quite complicated to say the least.
