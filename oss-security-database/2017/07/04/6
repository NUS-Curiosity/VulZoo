Subject: jabberd2: CVE-2017-10807: Allows to authenticate using SASL
 ANONYMOUS even if disabled

Hi

The Jabberd, before 2.6.1 allowed anyone to authenticate SASL
ANONYMOUS, even when sasl.anonymous c2s.xml option is not enabled.
The bug allows nauthorized usage of jabberd server installations and
could possibly lead to a DoS.

As mentioned in the subject, MITRE has assigned CVE-2017-10807 for
this issue.
