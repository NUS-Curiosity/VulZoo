Thanks.  I've just added Konstantin as well.

All - going forward, I think we don't need to discuss the individual
people's subscriptions to (linux-)distros on oss-security, including for
newly joining distros - I can handle that off-list, including making
sure there's a "vouching chain".  That's how it has been for changes in
who's subscribed for the already accepted distros anyway.  The need for
a discussion on oss-security is only about the joining distros, not
about their team members, as long as at least one person is vouched for.
