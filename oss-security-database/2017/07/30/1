Subject: Linux kernel: net/irda/af_irda.c: irda_getsockopt() stack infoleak

net/irda/af_irda.c

Sometimes irda_getsockopt() doesn't initialize all members of list field of irda_device_list struct.  This structure is then copied to
userland.  It leads to leaking of contents of kernel stack memory.  We have to initialize them to zero , or it will allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory by reading a copy of this structure
