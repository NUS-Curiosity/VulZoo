Subject: Re: accepting new members to (linux-)distros lists

I have a general remark on the recent developments on this list, in particular in relation with the "distros" list and especially, focusing on Linux kernel security:
a core issue at hand seems to be the funding of work that follows due diligence, standards and so forth, which is a top priority, and should be given appropriate importance at the top decision-making level. I think that in that line, applying for institutional funding through calls for H2020 public-private partnerships such as https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/ds-08-2017.html and similar non-European initiatives - if there are any - would be more than appropriate, as Linux is a core privacy-enhancing technology, in addition to the fact that "Open source and externally auditable solutions are encouraged in order to maximise uptake and increase the trustworthiness of proposed solutions.". By the way, the same would apply for BSDs, where I have a more direct interest, although they do not share Linux's European heritage! ;)
