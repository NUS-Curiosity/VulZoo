Subject: systemd fails to parse user that should run service

Hi all,

Just wanted to bring attention to issue with systemd not doing what is expected when parsing User that should run service.
When it fails to parse string starting with digit it fails back to root causing obvious threat to security.

See discussion with developer on github: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/6237

Best,
-Daniel Skowronski
