Subject: Re: linux-distros list membership application - CloudLinux

Hi all,

I am inclined to add CloudLinux to the linux-distros list unless there
are well-reasoned objections.  I'd appreciate any comments.

Thank you for posting this, Igor.

I am most concerned about your answer to:

So are you saying that you'll release fixes sooner (once you're on the
linux-distros list) only for this subset of packages that are modified
or packaged by you?  What about the rest?

OK.  You'll likely need to choose additional/other tasks very soon since
these trivial ones will likely transfer to another new distro joining,
if one requests membership and meets the criteria shortly after you.

Thanks.  Out of the people you listed, you and Konstantin appear to have
been on oss-security for a long while, but Leonid doesn't appear to be
subscribed - or is he?  If not, he probably needs to subscribe now.
