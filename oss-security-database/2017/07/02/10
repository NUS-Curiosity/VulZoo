The immediate thought that springs to mind is the [lack of OpenPGP
support in bugzilla] which makes it difficult to ensure confidentiality
unless disabling all email warnings.

For an organization it is possible to ensure a level of security as they
control all email endpoints (and disable email forwarding), so
information never leaves a secured zone, but for multiple parties
involved it would need to be fixed or configured to only send e.g "Bug
XXX has been updated, please log in to see details", which can make the
workflow inconvenient.

Notes:
[lack of OpenPGP support in bugzilla] I say lack of OpenPGP support as
the current implementation is too flawed to be used, this is elaborated
on in http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/02/13/8
