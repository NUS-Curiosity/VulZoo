I've been thinking about this list of items and also some of the
challenges of Stack Clash.  Something that frequently came up was
uncertainty about what the current set of patches were and there was
also lack of clarity on dates.

I think a lot of the administrative tasks outlined can be better
handled through a system other than email.

What do you think about having a public bugzilla (or similar system)
where tracked issues are kept as private bugs?  I think this could be
hosted in a way that everyone felt comfortable with (ensuring enough
people had SSH access to for audit purposes).  It's relatively easy to
stick everything behind SSL.

In addition to helping to make sure there's clear information (like a
summary, current patches, etc), I think the Project Zero approach of
making a private bug public post-embargo helps share information and
provide more transparency after the event.

I'm not suggesting that a bug tracker eliminate the discussions on the
list, but really just supplement it.  If there's interest in this, we
would be very willing to set it up and deal with the hosting aspect of
it.

Thoughts?
