It is common to assign CVEs for issues discovered via fuzzers and
sanitizers even if the consequences aren't visible without them: perhaps
the consequences aren't visible to users only by accident.

Some people only accept a vulnerability report if there's an exploit that
goes along with it but developing even a proof of concept is difficult
and error-prone. Lack of an exploit doesn't prove that an issue can safely
be ignored. (There's always someone more dedicated to writing an exploit.)

Assigning a CVE number makes downstream consumers aware of the issue and
each can prioritize a fix as they see fit based on their own threat models.

I believe the general consensus is that only the UBSAN sanitizer is safe
for 'daily use'; the others aren't themselves security hardened and in
fact have lead to exploits. This thread has more discussion:
