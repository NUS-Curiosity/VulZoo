Subject: CVE-2017-10810 Kernel: virtio-gpu: memory leakage while creating
 gpu object

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the VirtIO GPU driver(CONFIG_DRM_VIRTIO_GPU) support 
is vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while creating a 
virtio gpu object in virtio_gpu_object_create().

A user/process could use this flaw to leak host kernel memory potentially 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:

This issue was reported by Li Qiang of Qihoo 360 Gear Team.

Thank you.
