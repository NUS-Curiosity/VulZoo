Subject: [ANNOUNCE] [SECURITY] CVE-2017-7660: Security Vulnerability in secure
 inter-node communication in Apache Solr

CVE-2017-7660: Security Vulnerability in secure inter-node
communication in Apache Solr

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Solr 5.3 to 5.5.4
Solr 6.0 to 6.5.1

Description:

Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication
when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted
node name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a
malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that
the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have
enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin
or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which
does not implement either "HttpClientInterceptorPlugin" or
"HttpClientBuilderPlugin", his/her servers are vulnerable to this
attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those
who use Kerberos are not affected.

Mitigation:
6.x users should upgrade to 6.6
5.x users should obtain the latest source from git and apply this patch:
