Subject: [cve-request@...re.org: Re: [scr357564] sqlite3 - fix in progress]

Hello; some buffer over-reads were recently discovered in sqlite3 via
Google's clusterfuzz of GDAL. Thanks to Even Rouault for coordinating and
D. Richard Hipp for the fast and friendly fix.

Here's the description and references I supplied to MITRE, and their
(trimmed) reply:
