Subject: [OSSA-2017-004] federated user gets wrong role (CVE-2017-2673)

================================================================
OSSA-2017-004: Incorrect role assignment with federated Keystone
================================================================

:Date: April 25, 2017
:CVE: CVE-2017-2673


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Keystone: >=10.0.0 <=10.0.1, ==11.0.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Boris Bobrov from Mail.Ru reported a vulnerability in Keystone
Federation. An authenticated user may receive all the roles assigned
to the user's project regardless of the federation mapping when there
are rules in which group-based assignments are not used. For example,
by requesting an admin user to get a role in their project, the user
may be granted the admin privileges for new scoped tokens. All setups
using the Keystone federation without group based assignments rules
are affected.
