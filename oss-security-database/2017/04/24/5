Thank you for bringing this in here.

I've attached the above URL's content in text/plain form, as required by
oss-security content guidelines (actual content must be on the list, not
only included by reference).

The bug is in drivers/net/macsec.c implementing IEEE 802.1AE (MACsec).
I hope it is rarely used and thus rarely exposed, and Linux kernel
support for it is rather new, right?

oss-security is no longer a place to request CVE IDs.  You may request a
CVE ID directly from MITRE:

https://cveform.mitre.org

Once you have the CVE ID, please post it to this same thread in here.

(For non-public issues, it is also still possible to request CVE IDs
along with notification to the (linux-)distros lists, as long as the
primary purpose of giving advance notice to the distros is providing
them with actionable information.  A few of the distros are CNAs, so
they'd assign CVE IDs from their pools.)
