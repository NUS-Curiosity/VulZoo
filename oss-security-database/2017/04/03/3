Subject: CVE-2017-7239: ninka license identification tool:  insufficient escaping of external input [vs]

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1


             ninka license identification tool
          insufficient escaping of external input

                CVE-2017-7239 / CVSS 9.3
                        1.07

The ninka license identification tool does not properly escape
special characters in the files it encounters - such as the ‘&’.

In case of an alien code bases; or a code base that is brought in for
examination - a third party may doctor the file names as to cause 
a certain result of the license compliance scan. Or the attacker may 
adversely affect the ninka user their environment (e.g. an automated
continuous integration setup) by causing it to hang.

This can then lead to unauthorised disclosure of information,
unreliable compliance information or a denial of services.

Versions affected: 
- - ------------------
All versions up to and including version 1.3.0.

Resolution:
- - -----------
Upgrade to version 1.3.2 or later - available on
https://github.com/dmgerman/ninka. 

Mitigations and work arounds:
- - -----------------------------
Test the filenames passed for obvious issues. Given that ninka is
generally only applied to (source)code - a regex matching just
the alphanumerics and a few glyphs such as the dash and dot
can usually be applied.
