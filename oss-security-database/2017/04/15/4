Hi Agostino,

Perhaps Ian is referring to the fact that at the "Secret Rabbit Code"
home of libsamplerate, to which your linked blog article provides this
link:
http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/
there is no reference to any version numbers of the form 1.0.x, but
only numbers such as 0.1.8 (the last release [dated 15.Aug.2011]
mentioned in the changelog as I write)
http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/ChangeLog
and 0.1.9 (the latest version actually available for download):
http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/download.html

I'm just as confused as Ian.

Cheers
