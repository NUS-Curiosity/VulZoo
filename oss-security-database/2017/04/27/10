Subject: CVE-2017-8291 ghostscript remote code execution

Hi,

Canonical has reported CVE-2017-8291 to ghostscript, a ghostscript code execution with -dSAFER to the ghostscript team.

With PS/EPS being processed also from the network with -dSAFER, this would count
for remote code execution.

The ghostscript bug is https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=697808
and had some more comments but was made private a bit after I last accessed it.

I captured the first comment at least in our bug.
https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1036453

The problem is I think around a type confusion in the rsdparams command.

Ciao, Marcus
