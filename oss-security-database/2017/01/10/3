 vulnerability

CVE-2016-3086: Apache Hadoop YARN NodeManager vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Hadoop 2.6.0, 2.6.1, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4
Hadoop 2.7.0, 2.7.1, 2.7.2

Description:
The YARN NodeManager in Apache Hadoop 2.6.x before 2.6.5 and 2.7.x  
before 2.7.3 can leak the password for credential store provider used by  
the NodeManager to YARN Applications.

If you use the CredentialProvider feature to encrypt passwords used in  
NodeManager configs, it may be possible for any Container launched by  
that NodeManager to gain access to the encryption password. The other  
passwords themselves are not directly exposed.

Mitigation:
2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.3.
2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.5
If you cannot upgrade to the latest version, set the permission of the  
jceks file appropriately to restrict access from unauthorized users.
