Hi Sebastian,

Thanks a lot for discovering this issue.

For information:
- this specific issue can be mitigated by setting `x11 no` in `/etc/firejail/firejail.config`, as in
  https://github.com/hashbang/shell-etc/pull/133
- the initial fix commited by netblues (firejail's dev) is racy:
  https://github.com/netblue30/firejail/commit/60d4b478f65c60bcc825bb56f85fd6c4fd48b250#commitcomment-20366636


Best,

  Keller Fuchs
