Subject: CVE Request: Irssi out of bounds read in format string

Hi,

can you please check whether the following Irssi issue needs a CVE

- Printing the value %[ leads to oob read

This has been reported to the Irssi project by Hanno Böck and is
already fixed as part of the last CVE request, however I failed to
include this issue in the initial report. Hanno has blogged about this
at [1] and linked it to the other issue which we credited him for (but
it is in fact a separate issue).

Thanks,
