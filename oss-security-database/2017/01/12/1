Subject: Four BIND vulnerabilities have been disclosed today (11 January) that
 are fixed in new security releases

ISC has issued new security releases of BIND today, which correct
three exploitable vulnerabilities discovered in the course of our
internal fuzz-testing and an additional exploitable vulnerability
reported to us by a contributor.

The issues are:

   CVE-2016-9131
   CVE-2016-9147
   CVE-2016-9444
   CVE-2016-9778

and details about each can be found in the BIND Security Advisories
section of the ISC Knowledge Base:


https://kb.isc.org/category/74/0/10/Software-Products/BIND9/Security-Advisories/

New security releases have been issued which correct the vulnerabilities.
These are available via the http://www.isc.org/downloads web page:

   BIND 9.9.9-P5
   BIND 9.10.4-P5
   BIND 9.11.0-P2

We encourage all parties using or distributing BIND to upgrade to these
versions as soon as possible so that they may be protected from the
vulnerabilities now that they have been publicly disclosed.
