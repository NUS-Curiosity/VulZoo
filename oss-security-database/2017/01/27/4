It was reported in https://github.com/libical/libical/issues/235 but then
closed by the submitter.

You could have stated in #251 that you believed this crash to be the same
than the one above. It was not obvious to me, I did it for you.

Here, I'm lost. You said that this oss-security report (CVE-2016-9584) is
the same as #253 but you have another file than the test case
submitted in #253.

Are you sure that this second file is the same underlying issue ?

You would have to send it to me first :-)
