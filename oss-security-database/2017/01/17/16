Subject: CVE Request: Plone Sandbox escape vulnerability

Dear oss-security List,

Please provide a CVE for the following issue:

Sandbox escape
    Accessing private content via `str.format` in through-the-web templates
and scripts. See this blog post by Armin Ronacher (
http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format/) for the
general idea. Since the `format` method was introduced in Python 2.6, this
part of the hotfix is only relevant for Plone 4 and 5, not Plone 3.
