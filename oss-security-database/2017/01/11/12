Subject: Introducing sodium_compat, a PHP polyfill for libsodium

Hello,

I've been working on this for a while. I was originally going to include a
PHP implementation of Argon2, but it turned out to be really slow (and I
didn't feel confident in my implementation, to boot).

Source code: https://github.com/paragonie/sodium_compat

Announcement post:

It's ISC licensed, just like libsodium, so once it's been audited you
should be able to use it in any PHP projects without hassle.
