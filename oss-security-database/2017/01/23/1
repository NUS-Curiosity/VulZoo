Subject: CVE request: lcms2 heap OOB read parsing crafted ICC profile

Originally disclosed on this list in August by Ibrahim El-Sayed, but the
CVE request was unclear so I guess it got lost:

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/288

An out-of-bounds heap read in lcms2 ("Little Colour Management System"),
in the function Type_MLU_Read in cmstypes.c.  This could be triggered by
an untrusted image with a crafted ICC profile.

Fixed in commit:

https://github.com/mm2/Little-CMS/commit/5ca71a7b

lcms2 is fairly bundled in various OpenJDK releases, so distributions
should check carefully whether they use bundled versions, and if so,
whether those have picked up the patch.
