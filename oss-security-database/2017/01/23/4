Subject: wavpack: multiple out of bounds memory reads

Hi,

Fuzzing wavpack led to the discoverey of several invalid memory reads.

global buffer overread in read_code / read_words.c
https://sourceforge.net/p/wavpack/mailman/message/35557889/

heap out of bounds read in WriteCaffHeader / caff.c
https://sourceforge.net/p/wavpack/mailman/message/35561921/

heap out of bounds read in unreorder_channels / wvunpack.c
https://sourceforge.net/p/wavpack/mailman/message/35561939/

heap oob read in read_new_config_info / open_utils.c
https://sourceforge.net/p/wavpack/mailman/message/35561939/


All of them have been fixed with a single commit:
https://github.com/dbry/WavPack/commit/4bc05fc490b66ef2d45b1de26abf1455b486b0dc

Wavpack 5.1.0 has been released and fixes all issues.
