Virgil 3d project, used by Quick Emulator(Qemu) to implement 3D GPU support 
for the virtio GPU, is vulnerable to an OOB array access issue. It could occur 
when parsing texture instructions in parse_instruction().

A guest user/process could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process instance 
resulting DoS.
