Subject: CVE request Virglrenderer: host memory leakage when creating decode
 context

   Hello,

Virgil 3d project, used by Quick Emulator(Qemu) to implement 3D GPU support 
for the virtio GPU, is vulnerable to memory leakage issue. It could occur when

command.

A guest user/process could use this flaw to leak host memory resulting in DoS.
