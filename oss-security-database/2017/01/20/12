I see you reported multiple bugs on github's libical issues page:
https://github.com/libical/libical/issues/251
https://github.com/libical/libical/issues/252
https://github.com/libical/libical/issues/253

Looking at the backtrace, it seems that #253 is the same as this one.
Do you confirm?

Any reason why you did not request a CVE for #251?

#253 has a reproducer here:
https://github.com/libical/libical/files/627392/heap-use-after-free.ical.txt

Is this the same file?

If it's a different file, then I'd like to have access to the file but I
would prefer if it was just available publicly and not to me only.
