Subject: CVE requests: code injection in rubygem espeak-ruby and code
 injection in rubygem festivaltts4r

Two similar vulnerabilities in ruby text-to-speech libraries.

1) espeak-ruby

Rubygem espeak-ruby passes user modifiable strings directly to a shell
command.

An attacker can execute malicious commands by modifying the strings that
are passed as arguments to the speak, save, bytes and bytes_wav methods in
the lib/espeak/speech.rb.

Patched in 1.0.3

2) festivaltts4r

Rubygem festivaltts4r passes user modifiable strings directly to a shell
command.

An attacker can execute malicious commands by modifying the strings that
are passed as arguments to the to_speech and and to_mp3 methods in
lib/festivaltts4r/festival4r.rb.
