Subject: CVE request Weblate: information disclosure in password reset form

Weblate contains an information disclosure issue in it's password reset
form. When entering an arbitrary email address in the password reset
form Weblate will report back "User with this email address was not
found." this makes it possible to figure out which user accounts exist
on the weblate instance.

Affected: weblate 2.10 and earlier.
