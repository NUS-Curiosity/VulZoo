Subject: CVE request Kernel: kvm: use-after-free issue while creating
 devices

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the Kernel-based Virtual Machine(CONFIG_KVM) support 
is vulnerable to a use-after-free flaw. It could occur while creating devices, 
via ioctl('/dev/kvm', ...) calls.

A user/process could use this flaw to crash the host kernel resulting in DoS 
or potentially escalate their privileges on a system.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/a0f1d21c1ccb1da66629627a74059dd7f5ac9c61

Reference:
----------
   -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1414506

Thank you.
