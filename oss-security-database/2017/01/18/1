Subject: CVE request Qemu: audio: memory leakage in es1370 device

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the ES1370 audio device emulation support is 
vulnerable to a memory leakage issue. It could occur while doing a device 
unplug operation; Doing so repeatedly would result in leaking host memory, 
affecting other services on the host.

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to cause a DoS and/or 
potentially crash the Qemu process on the host.
