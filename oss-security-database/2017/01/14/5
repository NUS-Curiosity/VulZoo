Normal applications are supposed to be designed to use the Qt containers with, 
in the extreme, a couple hundred thousand items. If you're using them with 
upwards of a billion elements, you should redesign.

If you're dealing with untrusted data, then you're supposed to sanity check it 
before passing to any container. That's true for even the Standard Library 
containers: you don't ask it to allocate 6 GB just because you got that size 
from the network or some file, because it may succeed and that would still be a 
DoS due to high swap usage.

As for QXmlSimpleReader and for the whole QtXml module, it is in Done state. 
We're not working on it. We will fix security issues, though, so we need to 
analyse the details that you've supplied.
