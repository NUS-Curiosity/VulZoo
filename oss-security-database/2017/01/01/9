Subject: libtiff: NULL pointer dereference in TIFFReadRawData (tiffinfo.c)

Description:
Libtiff is a software that provides support for the Tag Image File Format 
(TIFF), a widely used format for storing image data.

A crafted tiff file revealed a NULL pointer access.

The complete ASan output:

# tiffinfo -Dijr $FILE

TIFFReadDirectoryCheckOrder: Warning, Invalid TIFF directory; tags are not 
sorted in ascending order.
TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, Unknown field with tag 384 (0x180) encountered.
TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, Unknown field with tag 1093 (0x445) encountered.
TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, Unknown field with tag 2 (0x2) encountered.
TIFFFetchNormalTag: Warning, ASCII value for tag "DocumentName" contains null 
byte in value; value incorrectly truncated during reading due to 
implementation limitations.
TIFFFetchNormalTag: Warning, Incorrect count for "JpegProc"; tag ignored.
TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, Photometric tag value assumed incorrect, assuming 
data is YCbCr instead of RGB.
TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, SamplesPerPixel tag is missing, applying correct 
SamplesPerPixel value of 3.
_TIFFVSetField: Warning, SamplesPerPixel tag value is changing, but 
SMinSampleValue tag was read with a different value. Cancelling it.
