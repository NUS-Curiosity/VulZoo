Yes, we know that sometimes command line tools with issues like READ of size 1 
cannot create damage.
However, for completeness and for people/packagers that want to have them 
fixed in they repository, I shared the details as well.

For some reasons I like to fuzz on a stable releases. Since libtiff ships some 
binaries, I take time to test each binary. So, there was a situation where a 
bug filed against an issue reproducible via tiffcp was fixed from a commit 
which addressed an issue filed against tiffcrop.
But as you have pointed out, there were cases where a commit addressed a READ 
issue and later on it was discovered that it fixed a WRITE issue too.

The commit that addresses the specific issue seems to be 
9657bbe3cdce4aaa90e07d50c1c70ae52da0ba6a.
However the process seems to fails to exit and went into a loop, but that's a 
different issue and needs to be reported upstream.
