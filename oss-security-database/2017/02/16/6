I saw no response from MITRE.

Kurt, who is not with MITRE but who presumably knows what he's saying,
implied it'd be non-trivial for MITRE to separate issues in open source
vs. other software:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/02/12/2

"We could also have the MITRE CVE ID feed new stuff into oss-security but it
would include non open source stuff."

MITRE - is this difficulty the reason for the lack of response so far?
If so, should we consider workarounds such as setting up another mailing
list to which all assigned CVE IDs would be posted?
