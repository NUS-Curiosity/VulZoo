Once it's completely up and running, DWF should address these issues.
Researchers and organizations can easily become CNAs under DWF, with
assigned CVE blocks. For OSS, the process of getting a CVE (including
pre-publication) should be much simpler than it has been, especially
in recent years. It's not quite there yet, but Kurt and team have put
a lot of effort into laying the groundwork for a much better solution
than the ad-hoc "send an email and hope" process that we've become
accustomed to.

The old system was far from perfect, as is the interim MITRE web form
- hopefully with the help of the community, DWF will be able to
provide a better process for all involved. For OSS, DWF is the
solution we need to be focused on, and helping it to evolve to suit
the needs of everyone.

While I believe that DWF represents a substantial step forward for
OSS, and getting CVEs to those that need them, when they need them; my
feelings on CVEs for commercial software remain rather negative. I've
stopped requesting CVEs for commercial software due to all of the
issues - if I discover something where I believe a CVE is especially
important, I direct the request through CERT/CC or another
origination. But, this is getting off-topic.
