In my perhaps limited experience, Debian package maintainers do not 
take action to correct a security issue in stable distributions unless 
a CVE is assigned.  They do not usually act merely based on the 
upstream package developer/maintainer reporting that they discovered 
and fixed a security issue.  If it is more challenging to get a CVE 
assigned, then many more security issues in stable distributions will 
remain unfixed.
