Understand.

Hm... breaking thread should not happen... at least with non-broken 
email clients. If everybody in discussion correctly set In-Reply-To 
header then whole thread (correctly tree) will be preserved. And if 
everybody correctly set References header then even missing emails does 
not break threading visualization. Information from References headers 
provide transitive closure of thread tree from which original tree can 
be reconstructed... But if somebody does not fill References or In-
Reply-To headers then thread will be broken independently of 
subscription to list.

Now I see that message to which I replied was without In-Reply-To and 
also without References headers. So thread was already broken.

I understand that breaking threading is bad and cause problems, but in 
lot of times it is problem of broken email clients which do not fill 
needed headers :-(
