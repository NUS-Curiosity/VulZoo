Subject: A note about the multiple crashes in zziplib

Hello all,

I posted several crashes about zziplib.

The latest release was done ~5 years ago and the upstream bugs place seems to 
be dead. However, I will forward them on their website.

I didn't receive any type of feedback from the maintainer so I don't know if 
some of them are duplicates.
In any case there are problems where the same codebase was used in more 
places, e.g.:

http://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2017/02/09/zziplib-null-pointer-dereference-in-main-unzzipcat-c/ shows a null ptr at: unzzipcat.c:94

and

https://blogs.gentoo.org/ago/2017/02/09/zziplib-null-pointer-dereference-in-main-unzzipcat-mem-c/ shows a null ptr at: unzzipcat-mem.c:94

Both C file have the same code at line 94:
printf ("%s\n", name);

So, while in the past, sometimes, we saw that one 'change' in the code was 
able to fix more than one issue, in this case, the issue is the same but it 
duplicate in more '.c' file
