Subject: MITRE is adding data intake to its CVE ID process

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

oss-security Mailing List Members,

To more efficiently assign and publish CVE IDs and to enable
automation and data sharing within CVE operations, MITRE is changing
the way it accepts CVE ID requests on the oss-security mailing list.
Starting today, please direct CVE ID requests to this web form
<https://cveform.mitre.org/>. Through this form, you can request a new
CVE ID, update a CVE ID that was already assigned, and submit
questions or feedback to the CVE Team.

The Distributed Weakness Filing (DWF) Project
<https://distributedweaknessfiling.org/> is the root CVE Numbering
Authority (CNA, described more at
<https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html>) that handles open-source
software vulnerability requests. Please note that the DWF CNA is not
yet ready to handle volume assignments, however they are actively
working towards this in the coming weeks and months. Once ready, they
will be responsible for the assignment of CVE IDs for open-source
software (not covered by another CNA) through their own structured
intake web form. At that time, we will inform the community of the
change and direct them to the DWF web form. Until that time, MITRE
will continue to handle any requests for CVE IDs from oss-security
list users who submit them through the web form at
<https://cveform.mitre.org/>.

We understand that oss-security is for vulnerabilities that should
have immediate public disclosure. You can continue to send details to
oss-security and propose that a CVE ID should exist. To actually
obtain the CVE ID, please also visit the web form at
<https://cveform.mitre.org/>. When you enter a vulnerability
description on the web form, the CVE and description will typically be
available on the NVD and CVE web sites at the same time or shortly
after we email the CVE ID to you. Because of this, we strongly prefer
that you enter a complete description (including the product name and
affected versions) that can be published as-is. Please do not submit
only a link URL or only code.

The CVE team will continue to watch the oss-security list for any
disputes or clarifications about whether a CVE ID should exist or is a
duplicate. (More specifically, you can use the oss-security forum to
quickly downvote a CVE ID proposal before the CVE ID ever exists.) The
CVE team will track this information and include it when considering a
CVE assignment. CVE is not abandoning the substantial crowdsourcing
value that the mailing list traffic has been providing.

If you have had trouble using the <https://cveform.mitre.org/> site,
please let us know specifically what happened and how it did not meet
your expectations. We would also like to hear your thoughts about what
vulnerability information should appear both in an oss-security
posting and in the CVE List, and whether some types of information
should be in one of these but not the other (e.g., if you want the CVE
List to specify the impact whenever possible but not list every
exploitation step).
  
For more information or questions regarding this change, you can
contact MITRE at cve@...re.org, submit a comment at
<https://cveform.mitre.org/>, or visit us at <https://cve.mitre.org/>.

Regards,
