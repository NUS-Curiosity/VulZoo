Subject: zziplib: load of misaligned address in memdisk.c

Description:
zziplib is an intentionally lightweight library that offers the ability to 
easily extract data from files archived in a single zip file.

A fuzz on it discovered the load of a misaligned address. It can cause 
undefined behavior.

The complete ASan output:
