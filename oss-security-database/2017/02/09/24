I'm also concerned about this.  Last time I asked a MITRE employee
about this as a result of the automated mail that oss-security
sends out when it detects a CVE request, and I did not receive a
reply.

So far I've only requested CVE IDs for projects that have no
obvious CNA.

For me, having to use a Google docs form is unacceptable.  I try to
avoid Google in my life as much as possible.  I'd rather avoid
requesting a CVE ID, or let someone else do it, if that's the only
remaining option for non-listed free software projects.

The oss-security list was a reasonably good solution for me.  The only
disadvantage is that time passes between initial announcement and the
CVE ID, because (AFAIK) a CVE request needs to contain a reference to
the announcement as "proof" that the vulnerability is real and not a
duplicate.  In an ideal world, free software project leaders should be
able to request a CVE ID _before_ announcing a vulnerability to their
user base.  If there were some way to register people as project leaders,
the "proof" should not be necessary, they should be able to request a
CVE ID with authority.

This delay between announcement and getting a CVE ID has always bothered
me about CVE requests via oss-security.  On the other hand, I like the
fact that there's a somewhat centralised place to watch for important
and early(!) free software security information.
