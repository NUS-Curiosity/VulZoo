Subject: CVE-2017-2630 Qemu: nbd: oob stack write in client routine
 drop_sync

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the Network Block Device(NBD) client support 
is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow issue. It could occur while 
processing server's response to a 'NBD_OPT_LIST' request.

A malicious NBD server could use this issue to crash remote NBD client 
resulting in DoS or potentially execute arbitrary code on client host with 
privileges of the Qemu process.

Upstream patch:

Reference:

   -> https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1422415

'CVE-2017-2630' is assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.

Thank you.
