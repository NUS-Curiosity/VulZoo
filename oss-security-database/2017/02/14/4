Subject: Linux kernel: Reachable BUG_ON from userspace in
 sctp_wait_for_sndbuf()

Hello,

I'm not sure if now I should be posting this on os-sec@ after requesting
a CVE-ID via MITRE's web-form. Anyway.

It was reported that with Linux kernel, earlier than version v4.10-rc8, an application
may trigger a BUG_ON() in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf() if the socket TX buffer is full, a thread
is waiting on it to queue more data, and meanwhile another thread peels off the association
being used by the first thread.
