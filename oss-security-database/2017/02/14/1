My mistake - thanks for bringing this up!

It appears that resolve_entities=False (ie. options &= ~XML_PARSE_NOENT)
does *not* affect the expansion of predefined entities or character
entities.  See [1], [2] and parser.c + HTMLparser.c in libxml source.

1: https://www.xml.com/pub/a/98/08/xmlqna1.html
2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references

These flags *do* control the expansion of internal entities, but I
expect that most common protocols and file formats should not rely on
those - including Excel.  As long as openpyxl has no need to resolve
internal entities, nor perform DTD validation, CVE-2016-9318 is not
relevant and the proposed patch looks correct.


So yes, the original CVE request was valid and should go ahead:

Sorry about muddying the water with misunderstanding(s).  The tricky
part of CVE-2016-9318 seems to be particular requirements of components
like xmlsec that want internal entity resolution without XXE, or DTD
validation without exposing the whole filesystem.
