Subject: mupdf: heap-based buffer overflow in fz_subsample_pixmap

Hello,

there in an heap overflow in fz_subsample_pixmap.

The bug was discovered by Kamil Frankowicz which said to have tested it 
against the current git head.
The same testcase does not crash the current stable 1.10a, but I can confirm 
(with a round of fuzzing on 1.10a) that stable is affected.

No fix atm.

Reproducer for 1.10a:
