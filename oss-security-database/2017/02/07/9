Subject: CVE Request - Code execution vulnerability in GNU/bash v4.4
 autocompletion

Hi,

we would like to request a CVE ID for a vulnerability in GNU/bash
version 4.4, discovered on 2017-01-17. The issue has been fixed.
A detailed description can be found in our report (available at
https://github.com/jheyens/bash_completion_vuln | direct link
https://github.com/jheyens/bash_completion_vuln/raw/master/2017-01-17.bash_completion_report.pdf
).

In short: We can create a file with a specially crafted file name. A
user trying to use bash' path completion feature ('TAB-completion') on
this file will execute shell code without any additional actions taken.

The issue has been reported on 2017-01-17, a fix has been added to the
git's master branch on 2017-01-20 by GNU/bash maintainer Chet Ramey
(Commit ID 4f747edc625815f449048579f6e65869914dd715, available at
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/commit/?id=4f747edc625815f449048579f6e65869914dd715
).


Sincerely,

Jens Heyens
CISPA
