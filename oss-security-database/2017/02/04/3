Subject: pax-utils: dumpelf: multiple divide-by-zero in dumpelf.c

Description:
pax-utils is a set of tools that check files for security relevant properties.

A fuzz on dumpelf shows multiple divide-by-zero . They was reported to vapier 
which fixed the issues immediately.
Unfortunately I canâ€™t get the ASan stacktrace, so I will show only the 
useful(not at all) part of the crash.
