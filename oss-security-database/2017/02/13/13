This?

https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-Database

Quoting:

 IMPORTANT NOTE

 There is a good chance this database (and indeed repo) will be phased
 out in favor of the JSON database. If there is enough demand for it
 there may be a CSV representation of all the data, but if there isn't
 enough demand then we will simply drop it in 2017. So speak up if you
 want/need this.

Is there a separate place for the JSON data?  Where?
