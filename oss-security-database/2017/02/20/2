Thanks, Timothy.  For archival (since web pages tend to be gone after a
few years) and per oss-security list content guidelines, we'd like full
advisories to be posted right in here (including links as well is OK and
encouraged; including only links is not).

Attached is a mostly auto-converted text version of the above advisory.
(I only deleted the web page header/footer portions not specific to it.)
