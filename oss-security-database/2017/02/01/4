Subject: pax-utils: scanelf: out of bounds read in scanelf_file_textrel (scanelf.c)

Description:
pax-utils is a set of tools that check files for security relevant properties.

A fuzz on scanelf exposed an out-of bound read. It was reported to vapier 
which fixed the issue immediately.
Unfortunately I can’t get a symbolized ASan stacktrace, so I will show only 
the useful part of both asan and gdb.
