Subject: podofo: NULL pointer dereference in PdfOutputStream.cpp

Description:
podofo is a C++ library to work with the PDF file format.

A fuzz on it with the UBSAN discovered a NULL pointer access. The upstream 
project denies me to open a new ticket. So, Iâ€™m unable to communicate with 
them.

The complete UBSan output:

# podofopdfinfo $FILE
/tmp/portage/app-
text/podofo-0.9.4/work/podofo-0.9.4/src/base/PdfOutputStream.cpp:116:33: 
runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 2, which is declared to never 
be null

Affected version:
0.9.4

Fixed version:
N/A

Commit fix:
