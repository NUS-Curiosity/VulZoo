Subject: podofo: signed integer overflow in PdfParser.cpp

Description:
podofo is a C++ library to work with the PDF file format.

A fuzz on it with the UBSAN discovered a signed integer overflow. The upstream 
project denies me to open a new ticket. So, Iâ€™m unable to communicate with 
them.

The complete UBSan output:

# podofopdfinfo $FILE
/tmp/portage/app-
text/podofo-0.9.4/work/podofo-0.9.4/src/base/PdfParser.cpp:757:23: runtime 
error: signed integer overflow: 9223372036854775807 + 9 cannot be represented 
in type 'long'

Affected version:
0.9.4

Fixed version:
