Subject: podofo: multiple crashes

Hello all,

I discovered multiple crashes on podofo which is a library that works with the 
PDF file format.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to open tickets on their sourceforge space because 
of admin's restriction.

Upstream was poked privately but never answered, so if you have a way to 
report the bugs I will share here, would be great.

For completeness, since I add the git commit and the fixed version, if you 
know that something has been fixed, please let me know.
Thanks in advance
