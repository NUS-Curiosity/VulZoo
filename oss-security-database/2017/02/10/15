This is a fine supplement to the oss-security list, but it completely
removes the possibility of natural discussion of CVEs by members
of the list.  Valuable insights might never surface unless every list 
member manually monitors the database and decides to send a 
message regarding a given database entry.

In short, it removes the best avenue toward the collaboration upon
which all OSS development is based in the first place.  I don't mind
if MITRE requires submitters to use their web stuff, but messages
generated by that tool should also appear on this list, or something
very valuable will be lost.
