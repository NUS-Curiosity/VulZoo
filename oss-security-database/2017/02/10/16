I know this is sort of out of the blue, but it strikes me as very
important, so I'm going to deal with this request right now.

I'm helping Kurt with some DWF tasks and this CVE request showed up. I
can't find a reference to a previous request for this issue, it's also very
high profile and I'm told being exploited in the wild. I'm not seeing a
previous request for the latest wordpress issue. I don't want an assignment
request to wait until after the weekend.

It's #4 on the wordpress site:
https://wordpress.org/news/2017/01/wordpress-4-7-2-security-release/

I saw 1-3 had CVE IDs requested on January 27th.

Let's use CVE-2017-1001000 for #4

Thanks.
