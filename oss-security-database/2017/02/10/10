The purpose of OVE IDs is literally only creating a unique identifier
that no other maintainer or security researcher will be using to
identify a different vulnerability. That's all they are. How you
publish the vulnerability for which you have used the identifier
is up to you.

They're slightly more readable and memorable than using
/proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid to allocate identifiers, and they give
you some vague idea of how old the vulnerability report is. That's about
the only difference.

(Hmm, now I'm tempted to use /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid next
time I need a unique ID for a vulnerability that's already public...)

I'm pretty sure those aren't security vulnerabilities in any product :-P
