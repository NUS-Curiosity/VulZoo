Subject: Re: MITRE is adding data intake to its CVE ID process

Hi,

I agree with John as well (regarding his suggestion).

As a side remark, would it be possible to properly configure the
webserver of https://cveform.mitre.org? In environements that perform
strict TLS checking, it cannot work, due to missing certificates chain.

Cheers,
Pierre
