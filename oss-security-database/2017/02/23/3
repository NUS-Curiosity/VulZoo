Subject: spice-server: CVE-2016-9577, CVE-2016-9578: remote DoS and buffer
 overflow from crafted messages

Two vulnerabilities in the server component of SPICE
<https://spice-space.org/> were recently assigned CVEs by Red Hat -
distros got notified during embargo, but I neglected to follow up here:

 - CVE-2016-9577 spice: Buffer overflow in main_channel_alloc_msg_rcv_buf
   <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1401603>

 - CVE-2016-9578 spice: Remote DoS via crafted message
   <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1399566>

Both of these attacks are accessible to unauthenticated attackers that
can make connections to the SPICE server.  CVE-2016-9577 may lead to
code execution (heap overflow), while the impact of CVE-2016-9578 is
limited to denial of service.

Both issues were reported by Frediano Ziglio, and fixed in the following
upstream commits:
