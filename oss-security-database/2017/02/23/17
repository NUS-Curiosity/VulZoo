Multiple Vulnerabilities in tnef
================================

Summary and Impact
------------------
Multiple Integer Overflows, Type Confusions and Out of Band Reads and
Writes have been discovered in tnef 1.4.12 and earlier. These could
be exploited by tricking a user into opening a malicious winmail.dat file.


Product Description
-------------------
From the Readme.md:
TNEF is a program for unpacking MIME attachments of type
"application/ms-tnef". This is a Microsoft only attachment. Due to the
proliferation of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange mail servers, more and
more mail is encapsulated into this format. The TNEF program allows one
to unpack the attachments which were encapsulated into the TNEF
attachment. Thus alleviating the need to use Microsoft Outlook to view
the attachment. TNEF is mainly tested and used on GNU/Linux and CYGWIN
systems. It 'should' work on other UNIX and UNIX-like systems.
