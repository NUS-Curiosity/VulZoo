Subject: util-linux 2.29.2 fixes CVE-2017-2616

Hi,

util-linux 2.29.2 fixes CVE-2017-2616, a race condition which allowed local users
to kill other processes.

https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.29/v2.29.2-ReleaseNotes

"
  It is possible for any local user to send SIGKILL to other processes with root
  privileges.  To exploit this, the user must be able to perform su with a
  successful login.  SIGKILL can only be sent to processes which were executed
  after the su process.  It is not possible to send SIGKILL to processes which
  were already running.
"

Root cause of the flaw that a regular exit of the child process and the su ctrl-c kill of the
child PID could race and so you would be able to later started process with this specific PID.

The fix is here:

Ciao, Marcus
