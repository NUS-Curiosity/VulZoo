Subject: CVE-2017-2633 Qemu: VNC: memory corruption due to unchecked resolution
 limit

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the VNC display driver support is vulnerable 
to an out-of-bounds memory access issue. It could occur while refreshing the 
vnc display surface area in 'vnc_refresh_server_surface'.

A user/process inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
resulting in DoS.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> http://git.qemu-project.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=bea60dd7679364493a0d7f5b54316c767cf894ef
   -> http://git.qemu-project.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commitdiff;h=9f64916da20eea67121d544698676295bbb105a7

Older versions of Qemu are affected, latest upstream releases are not.

'CVE-2017-2633' has been assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.

Thank you.
