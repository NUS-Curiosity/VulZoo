Not sure what "rejected" means (did the email delivery failed or the maintainer rejected your input, etc).

But generally for GNU Software,
If you don't get timely response from the maintainer,
you can send an email to "security@....org" ,
and if that doesn't help, escalate to "maintainers@....org".
see https://www.gnu.org/software/security/
