One use case are "sandbox" languages, such as JavaScript. JS engines
often use third-party regex libraries with attacker-controlled
regexes. They don't particularly about OOM / CPU exhaustion, but RCE
that allows a malicious program to escape containment would be bad
news.

Probably no JS engine using uclibc, though.
