Subject: Re: stackguard fix in Red Hat and Ubuntu kernels

As far as I know this problem (SIGSEGV on access to mmap area) was not affect mainline,
mainline patch was correct.

We observe some problem with stack grow down,
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9802797/

and all responsible developers are informed already.

Thank you,
