It can be used with large fixed size stacks and no actual expansion, but
yeah it's expensive to add a check to every non-leaf prelude. It's not
as expensive as the SSP check for a function but it needs to cover many.

Since probes can be so much more efficient, it only makes sense to
consider it if getting probes fully working is going to take a long
time.
