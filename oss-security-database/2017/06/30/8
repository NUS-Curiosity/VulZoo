We can list multiple distros per task.  Or we can list Ubuntu, and that
wouldn't mean only you - but rather that Ubuntu's team should handle it.
Would that work for Ubuntu?

With multiple distros listed, there will need to be some coordination
between them - e.g., inform each other when transferring responsibility
(such as before several people go on vacation), or separate duties by
time of day.

I agree that for something as simple as getting back to message senders
this might not be worth the coordination.  So maybe one of the distros
wanting to join now would take this task, which would also serve to show
they care at least to read all messages promptly.  And the distros who
have been on the list for a while take less trivial tasks.

Regarding the anti-spam setup, it's not exactly as bad as you describe.
Messages are not dropped - rather, they're rejected during the SMTP
session, in response to DATA command end.  I hope that with most setups
on the other end, this results in the sender (person) getting notified.

What worries me is that for messages that are sent to us in plaintext,
this means they might be exposed to someone watching network traffic
even in cases when we don't yet accept and relay the message (because of
it initially lacking this tag).  Yet getting encrypted spam (for a
little while, before I made this setup) was no good.
