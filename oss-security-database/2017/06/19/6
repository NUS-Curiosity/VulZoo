I would consider those two GCC BZs (68065, 66479) a separate an distinct
issue.

It is far more important to address design issues around the existing
-fstack-check first.  I think we've got a pretty good handle on how to
address those problems and discussions with the upstream GCC community
have already started.

In an ideal world we'll get to a place where the new -fstack-check does
not change program semantics, never misses probes and is efficient
enough to just turn on and forget everywhere.  The existing
-fstack-check fails all three of those criteria.
