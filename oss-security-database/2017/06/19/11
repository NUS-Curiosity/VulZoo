CVE-2017-7668: ap_find_token buffer overread

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
httpd 2.2.32
httpd 2.4.24 (unreleased)
httpd 2.4.25

Description:
The HTTP strict parsing changes added in 2.2.32 and 2.4.24 introduced a
bug in token list parsing, which allows ap_find_token() to search past
the end of its input string. By maliciously crafting a sequence of
request headers, an attacker may be able to cause a segmentation fault,
or to force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value.

Mitigation:
2.2.32 users should either apply the patch available at
https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.32/CVE-2017-7668.patch
or upgrade in the future to 2.2.33, which is currently unreleased.

2.4.25 users should upgrade to 2.4.26.
