I'm also curious to know where the lines are.


I'm responsible for RancherOS, and think that both I, and my users would prefer that I had access to the embargoed information earlier, so preparing a response would have been less of a rush.


One of the things that would have made my last week less worrying, is to have some access to exploit code - so as to verify the changes actually had a useful effect.


RancherOS is a container oriented micro-linux distro with uptake in hybrid and on-premis clouds

We have the beginnings of an advisory page at http://rancher.com/docs/os/security/

And are happy to comply with embargos.

Also - keep up the awesome work - its impressive!

To clarify your example, we're primarily concerned with preparing
updates for our distribution's kernel and userland, not for containers.

We'd be happy to help when we're able to, but our intent is mainly
consumption for the security of our users.
We'll, of course, respect embargoes.
