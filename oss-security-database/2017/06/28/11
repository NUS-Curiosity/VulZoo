Subject: lame: two UBSAN crashes

Description:
lame is a high quality MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3) encoder licensed under the LGPL.

Few notes before the details of this bug. Time ago a fuzz was done by Brian Carpenter and Jakub Wilk which posted the results on the debian 
bugtracker. In cases like this, when upstream is not active and people do not post on the upstream bugzilla is easy discover duplicates, so I 
downloaded all available testcases, and noone of the bug you will see on my blog is a duplicate of an existing issue. Upstream seems a bit 
dead, latest release was into 2011, so this blog post will probably forwarded on the upstream bugtracker just for the record.

The complete ASan output of the issue:
