It does, but what this really means is that you'll need to ask for the
reporter's approval (as provided for in "until the agreed upon public
disclosure date/time, the reporter's explicit approval, or substantially
complete publication by others").  That's already the current practice.

I think/hope we haven't been bringing upstreams into the loop without
ensuring such approval by the reporter and lack of objections by other
distros.  Some upstreams would just commit the fix without coordination,
which is both good and bad, but it certainly violates some reporters'
reasonable expectations.
