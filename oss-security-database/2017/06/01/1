Hi.

I don't know about apple itself but in the clusterfuzz reports I see 4 public 
bugs about sqlite.
However they have a very small (2 days) range of regression, i.e. a commit 
made in those two days causes the problem.
I didn't check, but I suspect they didn't go in any release.

FTR, the time you are seeing in the regression range is UTC:
https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/issues/563

At this point I don't know if apple referer to those issues or the mentioned 
issues are not public.
