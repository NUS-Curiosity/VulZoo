Wow, that was quick.  I don't see how you could have been following the
thread, including in the period since May 27, and miss the request,
since most other distros replied to that very same thread.  With the
replies quoting parts of my request, it was many messages.  I mentioned
the 3 non-responsive distros by name in two messages - yesterday and
today (a few hours before bringing this to oss-security).

What was it about the oss-security posting that made you notice it,
unlike the many messages on the distros list?

Is it the encryption that causes you not to read some messages, or to
postpone doing so (for days)?

With such selective reading, you'd also miss some new issues that are
being brought up as part of this same thread.  The Subject stays since
it's unencrypted, but discussion deviates and expands to new topics.

Thanks,

Alexander
