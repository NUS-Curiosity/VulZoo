Hi Brad, Theo, all,

OpenBSD is not a member of distros@, and we therefore contacted them
separately: we tried a first time on May 3, then a few times after that,
and on May 12 we received a reply.  On that same day, and before we sent
them our advisory draft (OpenBSD part only), we asked them if they would
accept an embargo until May 30, and they accepted.

On May 13 they acknowledged receipt of our advisory draft, on May 17 we
sent them our proof-of-concept, and on May 18 we were notified by a
distros@ member that OpenBSD publicly patched their qsort(), and on May
19 we were notified by another distros@ member that OpenBSD publicly
patched their stack guard-page implementation.

On May 19 we asked OpenBSD for an explanation as to why they broke the
embargo, and on May 21 we received a mail from them but no explanation.

However, instead of dwelling on the past, we would like to ask an
important question about the future:  what should we do the next time we
(or other researchers) discover a vulnerability that affects OpenBSD and
other operating systems?  Will OpenBSD properly enforce the next
embargo?  Please advise.  Thank you very much!

With best regards,
