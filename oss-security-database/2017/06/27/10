Subject: Re: CoreOS membership to linux-distros

My main question would be what expertise do you have in helping with
security issues, e.g. kernel/glibc/other engineering talent? Or do you
simply need this as a consumer of such data (e.g. so you can get containers
ready to respin for embargoed issues, and to be clear, I'm not opposed to
this type of consumption if it's in the public interest, you won't break
embargoes, etc.).
