Subject: Re: What happens in order to get CVE numbers

You can request a CVE Identifier as soon as you can answer the following
questions:

1) What software is affected? Product name? Product version?
2) What is the problem type? (in some cases we accept "unknown" but you
better have a reproducer that does something nasty like crash the system or
execute code)
3) A description of the issue (which includes affected software. problem
type and ideally the impact)
4) A reference URL, and I know the DWF will accept URL's that don't exist
yet as long as you are trustworthy (e.g. "we will post the advisory at URL
X"), typically for open source something like a link to the issue or the
affected code is more than sufficient.

So yes, you can ask for a CVE well before you commit a fix (and in some
cases before you even fully understand the issue).
