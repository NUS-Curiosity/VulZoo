If/when you feel it matters, you can ask them.

Fair enough.  I think there's a difference between "speaking as an
employee of ..." (a lot of people often do) and "spokesperson for ..."
(is rarely the case).

That's my assessment too - "not completely unproductive".

That's a problem.  Please do try to be civil no matter what.  If you're
deliberately not being civil when you post in here, that's a reason for
me as a moderator to start rejecting your messages.

And to make it clear: no reply is expected to this message, nor to
anything else in this thread.  Let's end the thread right here.

Thanks!
