Subject: CVE-2017-10664 Qemu: qemu-nbd: server breaks with SIGPIPE upon client
 abort

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the Network Block Device(NBD) Server support 
is vulnerable to a crash via SIGPIPE signal. It could occur if a client aborts 
connection due to any failure during negotiation.

A remote user/process could use this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server 
resulting in DoS.
