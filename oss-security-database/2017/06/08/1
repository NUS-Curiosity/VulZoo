Subject: CVE-2017-9503 Qemu: scsi: null pointer dereference while processing
 megasas command

   Hello,

Quick Emulator(Qemu) built with the MegaRAID SAS 8708EM2 Host Bus Adapter 
emulation support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue. It could 
occur while processing megasas commands via megasas_command_complete().

A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process 
on the host resulting in DoS.
