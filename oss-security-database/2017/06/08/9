Subject: Re: Is not memory allocation failure a bug?

I just checked a fix for one of those into Firefox yesterday.  It wasn't
considered a serious problem because the malloc would eventually
fail safely, but it's better to predict the problem ahead of time and not
even try to malloc all available memory.

See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1368407
in which a tiny PNG file tries to claim Gigabytes of memory.
