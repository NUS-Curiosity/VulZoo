I really like this idea.  What would be the approach to software whose
documentation starts out with "turn off selinux," out of curiosity?
Obviously this lessens the security stance of the system, but presumably
the system is designed to be operable without selinux.  Would CVEs get
assigned for all bad ideas, or just those that expose actual attack
vectors?

This is going to cause you to hit INT_MAX relatively quickly.
