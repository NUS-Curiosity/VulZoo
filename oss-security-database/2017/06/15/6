Good question. I would rephrase it was "turn off the firewall" or "turn
off the Anti virus" and I think we're definitely into the "yes, that
needs a CVE" territory (even if it can't be fixed, at least people will
be more aware and maybe make more informed decisions when picking).

I would say that being told/forced (e.g. most systems that say turn off
SELinux say that because they couldn't make it work with SELinux on) do
definitely expose the system and people need to be aware of this.

Well part of it would be the current test case of "does anyone care",
e.g. do people actually use this/care enough to do the work to assign a
CVE, if someone wants to spend their time being the CNA for
stackoverflow and put out good CVEs I'm fine with that.
