Hi.

If you are reporting bugs to the bugzilla site,

When an anonymous user accesses the page, the following message is displayed and access is blocked.

"You are not authorized to access bug #632521. To see this bug, you must first log in to an account with the appropriate permissions"

As far as I know, when you request a CVE, you need to create an accessible reference address for anonymous users.

If you have a solution, let me know.

Thanks.
