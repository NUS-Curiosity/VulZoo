I think we can agree as a community of professionals that insults and name
calling are unnecessary and also not very effective. And before I get
accused of censorship I would point out I'm not wanting to stop anyone from
talking, I'm only wanting to stop people from talking in a way that is so
rude and insulting that it poisons the community and scares people away. I
assume Solar also supports this (if not... ergh. that's gonna be an awkward
conversation).
