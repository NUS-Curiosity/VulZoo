Subject: distros list archive

Hi,

I've just set up these archives of the private lists up until June 19:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/linux-distros/
http://www.openwall.com/lists/distros/

I did not decrypt the actual messages, but the statistics and the
message headers should provide some visibility into how much and roughly
what was discussed and when.

The messages appearing on distros should be strictly a subset of those
appearing on linux-distros, as per the description of the lists here:

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros

As you may notice, the Subject lines sometimes contain [vs] and other
times [vs-plain].  This reflects whether the messages traveled to the
list exploder in encrypted or plaintext form, respectively.  They
traveled to the list members in re-encrypted form either way.  The
[vs-plain] case commonly occurs on messages CC'ed to other parties, for
which the sender might not have had the keys.  MUAs generally don't
allow a message to be encrypted to a subset of the addressees and sent
in plaintext to others.

Enjoy.

Alexander
