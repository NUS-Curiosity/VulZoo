I didn't call "that fix" garbage.

I called the grsecurity patches garbage.

Why?

They aren't split up, there has never been any effort by you to make
them palatable to upstream, and when somebody else *dioes* try to make
them palatable to upstream, you start crying about how people are
taking advantage of your work (hah), and try to make them private
instead.

So tell me, why shouldn't I consider them garbage?  They are.

It's literally less work for people to re-implement things than look
at your mixed-up patches, and YOU SEEM TO BE DOING THAT ON PURPOSE.

Now, prove *me* wrong. Start trying to integrate your work upstream,
and send individual patches with commit logs that can be integrated.

Indeed, Brad.
