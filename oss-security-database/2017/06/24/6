Is is inappropriate to post only a link in here.  In cases like this,
please also quote at least the most essential portion of the content
you're referring to, which is:

"CZ.NIC has released Knot DNS 2.5.2 and Knot DNS 2.4.5. Beside several fixes and improvements,
these versions fix a flaw within the TSIG protocol implementation that would allow an attacker
with a valid key name and algorithm to bypass the TSIG authentication if no additional ACL
restrictions is set. This vulnerability was discovered by security experts from Synacktiv.
Special thanks to them!"
