Hi Alexander,

I respect your decision. Because this is your list. To myself, it's
not a crap. I was just simply talking the fact I know. I've been
suffering from Linux security for a long time due to lacking of the
defensive mitigation. Anyway, this kind of discussion may be somewhere
else but not on oss-security.

S0rry for the extra maintainence work on pre-moderation.
