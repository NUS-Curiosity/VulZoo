Subject: BIND9 CVE-2017-3140 & CVE-2017-3141

Today ISC announced CVE-2017-3140, CVE-2017-3141, and an operational
notification regarding LMDB in BIND 9.11


CVE-2017-3140 is a denial-of-service vulnerability affecting 9.9.10,
9.10.5, 9.11.0->9.11.1, 9.9.10-S1, and 9.10.5-S1 when configured with
Response Policy Zones (RPZ) utilizing NSIP or NSDNAME rules.

We are aware that some subscribers to this list maintain BIND packages
which have diverged from the official ISC code branches.  While we
cannot always offer specific guidance, in the case of CVE-2017-3140
maintainers who have selectively backported BIND changes are advised to
check whether they have included change #4377, as that change has been
determined to be a cause of CVE-2017-3140.


CVE-2017-3141 is a Windows privilege escalation vector affecting
9.2.6-P2+, 9.3.2-P1+, 9.4.x, 9.5.x, 9.6.x, 9.7.x, 9.8.x, 9.9.0->9.9.10,
9.10.0->9.10.5, 9.11.0->9.11.1, 9.9.3-S1->9.9.10-S1, and 9.10.5-S1.  The
BIND Windows installer failed to properly quote the service paths,
possibly allowing a local user to achieve privilege escalation, if
allowed by file system permissions.


BIND 9.11.0 and 9.11.1 carries a number of integration problems with
LMDB (liblmdb) that will be addressed in BIND 9.11.2, planned for
release in July/August 2017.
