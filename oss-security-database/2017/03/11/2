Dear CVE Assignment Team,

please provide CVE for the following issue:

use after free condition during netjoin processing [1]
======================================================
CWE Classification: CWE-416



Description

This issue was found and reported to us by APic.


Impact
------

This issue usually leads to segmentation faults. Targeted code
execution should be difficult.


Affected versions
-----------------

Irssi up to and including 1.0.1

We believe Irssi 0.8.21 and prior are not affected since a different
code path causes the netjoins to be flushed prior to reaching the use
after free condition.


Fixed in

Irssi 1.0.2

without any new features.
