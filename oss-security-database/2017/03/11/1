Subject: Re: CVE Request: Wordpress: 6 security issues in
 Wordpress 4.7 2

Hi Kurt,
  As someone who seems to ask about the CVEs for wordpress the most I'll
put my hand up to raise the CVEs for wordpress. I am only the Debian
packager for wordpress so if the wordpress project itself wants to raise
these CVEs then I'm all for handing it over to them.

Annoyingly, the mitre website breaks if you enter more than 2 requests in
(or it doesn't like something I typed). Something deep in
ScriptResource.axd gives a 500 error, so it will take a while to key all 6
in. This also explains why all 6 were not entered in one go.

 - Craig
