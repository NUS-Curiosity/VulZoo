Subject: CVE request for unchecked size argument in malloc() in CHICKEN Scheme

Hello all,

I'd like to request a CVE for an unchecked malloc() argument in
CHICKEN Scheme's SRFI-4 vector constructors, when allocating the
vector in unmanaged memory.  Due to the missing range check, this
could result in negative or too small size allocations, which would
result in a crash or a buffer overrun, depending on the size.

This issue affects all current releases of CHICKEN Scheme, including
the latest release, 4.12.0.

The official announcement was made here:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/chicken-announce/2017-03/msg00000.html

Cheers,
Peter Bex
