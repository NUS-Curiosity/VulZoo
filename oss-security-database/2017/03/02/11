Subject: another bunch of crashes in podofo

Hello,

I discovered other crashes in podofo, I forwarded them to upstream via the -users mailing list.
To avoid duplicates (i.e. bugs with different stacktrace but with the same root cause), I will probably stop the fuzz on it until I see an upstream reaction.
