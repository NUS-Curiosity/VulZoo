Subject: CVE-2017-7294: kernel: drm/vmwgfx: limit mip levels in
 vmw_surface_define_ioctl()

hello,

CVE-2017-7294 was assigned for another flaw in [vmwgfx] driver.

> Below is the CVE ID for this new vulnerability (we understand that it
> is completely different from CVE-2017-7261, even though the affected
> function is the same).
>
> [Suggested description]
> In was found that in the Linux kernel in vmw_surface_define_ioctl()
> function in 'drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c' file, a
> 'req->mip_levels[i]' are user-controlled values which are not checked
> for the upper limit and are used to calculate 'num_sizes' parameter.
> Both the 'num_sizes' and the array are 'uint32_t' so it is possible to
> make 'num_sizes' overflow. Later 'mip_levels[i]' are used as the loop
> count. This can lead an oob-write and/or kernel lockup or crash. Due
> to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled
> out.
