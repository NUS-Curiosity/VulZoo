Subject: Re: LXC: CVE-2017-5985: lxc-user-nic didn't verify network namespace ownership

I don't know whether that is the same bug, or a related one, but on Debian8 using LXC from jessie-backports, setting the default route in a container affects the host - namely, from an unpriv. container, setting the route sets the host's route as well.
lxc-info --version outputs 2.0.6 and no update is currently available (on Debian).

Jann Horn discovered that the lxc-user-nic program could be tricked into
operating on a network namespace over which the caller did not hold
privilege.

The behavior didn't follow what was documented in the lxc-user-nic(1)
man page:

It ensures that the calling user is privileged over the network
namespace to which the interface will be attached.

This issue is CVE-2017-5985.
