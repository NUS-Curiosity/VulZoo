Promptly review new issue reports for meeting the list's requirements and confirm receipt of the report and, when necessary, inform the reporter of any issues with their report (e.g., obviously not actionable by the distros) and request and/or propose any required yet missing information (most notably, a tentative public disclosure date/time) /- primary: Oracle, backup: vacant /

I've just added Wind River as backup for this role.  Please watch for
issues on which Oracle (and others) haven't provided an initial response
to the reporter or where such response is incomplete (per the above),
and provide your own response (CC'ing the list) whenever that happens.

It was a "pre-notification about a security advisory about to ship next week in sync with our next curl release", for CVE-2020-8177. On curl's git tree, that very bug did been fixed and released in 20200621:

We've received some responses in this thread regarding the specific
example above, but I'd like more general responses please.  Is there a
general task Wind River can reasonably help with for getting CVE details
published for issues that pass the distros and/or oss-security lists,
and how exactly could they help with that?

Thanks,

Alexander
