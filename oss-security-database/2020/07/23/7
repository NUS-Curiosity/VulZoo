This requirement is currently loosely specified as:

"Have someone already on the private list, or at least someone else who
has been active on oss-security for years but is not affiliated with
your distro nor your organization, vouch for at least one of the people
requesting membership on behalf of your distro (then that one
vouched-for person will be able to vouch for others on your team, in
case you'd like multiple people subscribed)"

So someone who's on (linux-)distros "or at least someone else who has
been active on oss-security for years but is not affiliated" should
state in here that they vouch for Vincent.  They may optionally make
this more specific (yet convincing) if they like, but that isn't
required.
