Thanks for the writeup.  Note that there are many open syzbot reports in the
fbdev, vt, and vgacon kernel subsystems.  These subsystems aren't actively
maintained (receiving drive-by fixes only), and the kernel developers recommend
to not enable these subsystems if you care about security
(https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/CAKMK7uF5zZH3CaHueWsLR96-AzT==wP8=MpymTqx-T+SRsXWHA@mail.gmail.com/).

This particular bug, for example, appears to have been already found by someone
running syzkaller and publicly reported over 2 years ago, with a C reproducer:
(https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/CAEAjamsJnG-=TSOwgRbbb3B9Z-PA63oWmNPoKYWQ=Z=+X49akg@mail.gmail.com/).
No one did anything.

I suggest that people relying on the security of these kernel subsystems
contribute resources to fixing the many known fuzzing bugs in them.
