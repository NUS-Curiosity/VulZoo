I worked with Vincent when we both worked at Red Hat (we no longer work 
together), and I can vouch for him personally as I've known him a number 
of years. However, in full disclosure, I am not on the private list, 
have only posted on this list a few times (mostly to report some minor 
issues I found), and have no knowledge of Flatcar Linux.
