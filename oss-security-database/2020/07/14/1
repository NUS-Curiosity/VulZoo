Subject: [SECURITY][CVE-2020-13925] Apache Kylin command injection vulnerability

Versions Affected: 2.3.0, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.5.0, 2.5.1, 2.5.2,
2.6.0, 2.6.1, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4, 2.6.5, 2.6.6, 3.0.0-alpha, 3.0.0-alpha2,
3.0.0-beta, 3.0.0, 3.0.1 3.0.2

Description:

Similar to CVE-2020-1956, Kylin has one more restful API which concatenates
the API inputs into OS commands and then executes them on the server; while
the reported API misses necessary input validation, which causes the
hackers to have the possibility to execute OS command remotely.

Mitigation:
Users of all previous versions after 2.3 should upgrade to 3.1.0.
