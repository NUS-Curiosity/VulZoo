I've encountered this in build systems before, where the quoting is
inconsistent and apparently can result in different levels of dequoting
for a target depending upon how it was reached.

What I've used for building those has been to specify %ORIGIN instead of
$ORIGIN and then binary-edit the resulting binary to switch that % back
to a $.  All quoting issues disappear and all binary offsets are stable.
Just make sure the binary-edit step is before any binary signing. :)

At some point, it's also worth considering static linking.
