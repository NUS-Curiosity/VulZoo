Subject: Re: Flatcar membership on the linux-distros list

Hi Vincent,

I intentionally didn't hurry to comment on this, hoping that others
would comment first.  I would still appreciate more comments by others.

Thanks.  Much of this looks convincing to me, but here are some comments:

Vincent, as far as I could find, you personally have subscribed to
oss-security 2 months ago, and I couldn't find anyone else from Flatcar
Linux subscribed.  (Maybe people are with personal addresses that I
didn't associate with Flatcar Linux.)

I also found only this one posting to Openwall lists by you:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2017/02/03/38

This is good, but it's not a lot.

What I see on the Flatcar Linux website is more convincing, but maybe
you can point us at specific examples of community participation by you
personally and/or by others at Flatcar Linux?

As I recall other applications to join the linux-distros list since we
introduced this contribute-back requirement, distros volunteered for
some tasks right away, not "after being a member for a period."  What
you say makes sense, but would be a deviation from the practice so far.
I'd appreciate not needing to make an exception for you.

We haven't yet heard from Pat Volkerding.  Given your LinkedIn profile,
I guess someone from Red Hat could vouch for you as well.
