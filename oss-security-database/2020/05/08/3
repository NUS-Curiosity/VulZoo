Subject: Incentives for pre-release reporting

My recollection (which could be wrong) suggests that vulnerabilities in
unreleased, not really shipping versions do not usually receive CVE IDs.

This has the problem that we cannot reward researchers with a CVE ID
assignment if they report issues in features under development.  If they
waited until after the release, they'd get one, so that is creating the
wrong incentive.

Am I wrong about the CVE program requirements here?  How do projects
handle this?

Thanks,
Florian
