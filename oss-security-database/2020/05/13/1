Subject: [CVE-2020-1945] Apache Ant insecure temporary file vulnerability

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

CVE-2020-1945: Apache Ant insecure temporary file vulnerability

Severity: Medium

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Ant 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7

Description:

Apache Ant uses the default temporary directory identified by the Java
system property java.io.tmpdir for several tasks and may thus leak
sensitive information. The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks also copy
files from the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an
attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.

Mitigation:

Ant users of versions 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 should set the
java.io.tmpdir system property to point to a directory only readable and
writable by the current user prior to running Ant.

Users of versions 1.9.15 and 1.10.8 can use the Ant property ant.tmpfile
instead. Users of Ant 1.10.8 can rely on Ant protecting the temporary
files if the underlying filesystem allows it, but we still recommend
using a private temporary directory instead.
