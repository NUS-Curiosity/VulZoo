Well, normally these limits are enforced at the OS level. Depending on your OS of choice there are different ways in which this is done. On BSD-derived systems it is most often in /etc/login.conf via login classes, e.g.:

daemon:\
        :ignorenologin:\
        :datasize=infinity:\
        :maxproc=infinity:\
        :openfiles-max=2048:\
        :openfiles-cur=1024:\
        :stacksize-cur=8M:\
        :localcipher=blowfish,a:\
        :tc=default:

whereby the user under which Postfix runs would be assigned to the daemon class (or, of course, a class which you define with suitable restrictions) and have the limits above (“tc=default” means “inherit what is not explicitly defined above from the “default” class, rest is self-evident, I hope).
