Subject: CVE-2020-10717 QEMU: virtiofsd: guest may open maximum file descriptor
 to cause DoS

   Hello,

A potential DoS issue was found in the virtio-fs shared file system daemon 
(virtiofsd) implementation of the QEMU. Virtiofsd is meant to share a host 
file system directory with a guest via virtio-fs device. The said DoS may 
occur on the host, if the guest was to open the maximum number of file 
descriptors under the shared directory. A guest user/process may use this flaw 
to cause DoS issue on the host.

Thank you.
