Subject: [CVE-2020-1930] Apache SpamAssassin Nefarious rule configuration
 (.cf) files can be configured to run system commands

Apache SpamAssassin 3.4.4 was recently released [1], and fixes an issue
of security note where nefarious rule configuration (.cf) files can be
configured to run system commands similar to CVE-2018-11805.  With this
bug unpatched, exploits can be injected in a number of scenarios
including the same privileges as spamd is run which may be elevated
though doing so remotely is difficult.  In addition to upgrading to SA
3.4.4, we again recommend that users should only use update channels or
3rd party .cf files from trusted places.  If you cannot upgrade, do not
use 3rd party rulesets, do not use sa-compile and do not run spamd as an
account with elevated privileges.

This issue has been assigned CVE id CVE-2020-1930 [2]
