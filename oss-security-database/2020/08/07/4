CVE-2020-9490: Push Diary Crash on Specifically Crafted HTTP/2 Header

Severity: important

Vendor: Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache HTTP Server 2.4.20 to 2.4.43

Description:
Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43
A specially crafted value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2
request would result in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2
PUSH a resource afterwards.

Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

Mitigation:
