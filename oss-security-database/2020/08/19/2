Subject: Linux Kernel 5.7.9 DRM  Double Free

The specific flaw exists within DRM memory management. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.

This has been already addressed in the upstream commit 5de5b6ecf97a021f29403aa272cb4e03318ef586
