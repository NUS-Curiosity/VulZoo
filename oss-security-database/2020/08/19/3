Note, this "vulnerability" was only accessible by root, so there's not
all that many privileges that could really be escalated there.  Don't
know why the original poster did not say that here, as they acknowledged
it in the "bug report" they sent many of us.

It was already "addressed" before this problem was pointed out to
anyone, so this was not fixed in relation to this being reported.

Also, the fix is now in the 4.19.140, 5.4.59, 5.7.16, 5.8.2 kernel
releases for those that care.

And finally, it was pointed out that any kernel running with the
CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED=y option would not have any problems with
this issue before it was fixed.
