Subject: CVE-2020-14364 QEMU: usb: out-of-bounds r/w access issue while
 processing usb packets

   Hello,

An out-of-bounds read/write access issue was found in the USB emulator of the 
QEMU. It occurs while processing USB packets from a guest, when 
'USBDevice->setup_len' exceeds the USBDevice->data_buf[4096], in 
do_token_{in,out} routines.

A guest user may use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS OR 
potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on 
the host.

* Attached herein is an upstream patch from Gerd Hoffmann(CC'd) to fix this
   issue.

* 'CVE-2020-14364' is assigned to this issue by Red Hat Inc.

* This issue was independently reported by Ziming Zhang, Gonglei Arei and
   Yanyu Zhang(CC'd).

   Gonglei and Yanyu mentioned that the issue was found by Xiao Wei(CC'd).


Thank you.
