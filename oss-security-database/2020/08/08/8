Yes, you're correct. There is a mod_uwsgi maintained elsewhere in the
wild. This one was a typo that had made its way into the description.

Thanks - I've included our security mailing list to pass this feedback
along to the rest of the security group as a heads up. As you can
imagine, with such a strong downstream community from our releases, we
try to be careful so as to not place too much information in the
descriptions to make it trivial to exploit vulnerabilities before those
downstream packagers can incorporate fixes. At the same time, there's
always room for improvement :-)

Have a great weekend!
