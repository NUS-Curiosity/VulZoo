            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-0543 / XSA-320
                              version 2

           Special Register Buffer speculative side channel

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Add a link to Intel's cross reference of affected hardware.

Provide a suggested workaround for Ivy Bridge hardware, which is not
receiving a microcode update.  This includes a 3rd patch for each
release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

This issue is related to the MDS and TAA vulnerabilities.  Please see
https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-297.html (MDS) and
https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html (TAA) for details.

Certain processor operations microarchitecturally need to read data from
outside the physical core (e.g. to communicate with the random number
generator).  In some implementations, this operation is called a Special
Register Read.

In some implementations, data are staged in a single shared buffer, and
a full cache line at a time is returned to the core which made the
Special Register Read.  On parts vulnerable to MFBDS or TAA, an attacker
may be able to access stale data requested by other cores in the system.

For more details, see:
  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00320.html
  https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/processors-affected-transient-execution-attack-mitigation-product-cpu-model

IMPACT
======

An attacker, which could include a malicious untrusted user process on a
trusted guest, or an untrusted guest, can sample the contents of
certain off-core accesses by other cores in the system.

This can include data whose use may depend on the secrecy of the value,
such as data from the Random Number Generator (e.g. RDRAND/RDSEED
instructions).

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

Only x86 processors are vulnerable.
ARM processors are not believed to be vulnerable.

Only Intel based processors are affected.  Processors from other
manufacturers (e.g. AMD) are not believed to be vulnerable.

Please consult the Intel Security Advisory for details on the affected
processors.

MITIGATION
==========

Disabling RDRAND (and, where applicable, RDSEED) will avoid the
vulnerability.  It may have other adverse consequences, such as guests
generating keys with weak random numbers, or guests hanging during
boot waiting for entropy.

A domain (guest, dom0, or service domain) which is runs with RDRAND
disabled in CPUID, and whose software conforms to normal feature
detection as specified in the Intel/AMD manuals, will not be
vulnerable to snooping by other domains.  But such a domain *can*
still potentially snoop on any domains which are still using RDRAND.

This mitigation is recommended to be applied globally, due to the
practical complexity of auditing all software in a VM to confirm that
there are no vulnerable uses of the RDRAND/RDSEED instructions.

RDRAND and RDSEED can be disabled at the host level by booting Xen
with `cpuid=no-rdrand,no-rdseed`, which will hide the feature from all
domains including guests and dom0.  Xen 4.12 and earlier require the
appropriate patch 3 below for this mechanism to work.

RDRAND and RDSEED can be disabled for guests with the following
setting in the VM configuration file (xl.cfg):
  cpuid=["host:rdrand=0,rdseed=0]"
(NB it would have to be merged into any existing cpuid= setting). Xen
4.9 and earlier require the appropriate patch 3 below for this
mechanism to work.

RESOLUTION
==========

New microcode is being released on some affected parts to work around
the vulnerability.  It may be available via a firmware update (consult
your hardware vendor), or available for OS loading (consult your dom0 OS
vendor).

For Ivy Bridge hardware, which is not receiving a microcode update, see
MITIGATION, above.

On Xen 4.13 and later, OS microcode can be loaded at runtime. See
https://xenbits.xen.org/docs/latest/admin-guide/microcode-loading.html#runtime-microcode-loading
for details on the xen-ucode utility.

Loading the microcode, either at boot or at runtime, suffices to
mitigate the issue, as protections are active by default.  The
mitigations do have an impact on latency of individual RDRAND/RDSEED
instructions.

The patches below are for Xen, and offer boot time information,
defaults selection, opt-out controls, and uniform controls for hiding
the RDRAND/RDSEED instructions.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply
to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent
release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the
stable branch before applying these patches.
