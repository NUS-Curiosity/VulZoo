Subject: adns (dns resolver library) multiple vulns

Hi.  I'm the upstream maintainer for adns.  There were outstanding
security problems which I have sat on for far too long, but I have now
finally dealt with them properly.  My apologies.

The fixes have incorporated in adns 1.5.2 and 1.6.0.  See the release
announcement here:
  https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/adns-announce/2020/000004.html

If you prefer to apply specific patches, the relevant commits are
in my git repository:

  https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/ucgi/~ianmdlvl/githttp/adns.git
in this commit range

(which you will find is covered by the signed tag adns-1.5.2).

The most serious problems are remote code execution, within the
adns-using application, exploitable by the local recursive resolver.

Thanks for your attention.

Ian.
