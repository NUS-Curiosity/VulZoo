Subject: CVE-2020-13800 QEMU: ati-vga: infinite recursion in ati_mm_read/write
 calls may lead to DoS

   Hello,

An infinite recursion issue was found in the ati-vga emulator of the QEMU. It 
could occur in ati_mm_read/write routines while accessing VGA registers, for 
certain values of the 'mm_index' variable. A guest user/process may use this 
flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in DoS scenario.
