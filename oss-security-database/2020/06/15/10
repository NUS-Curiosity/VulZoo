Subject: Re: lockdown bypass on mainline kernel for loading unsigned modules

Hi Mitre,

People are requesting a CVE to track this and are poking me to poke
you to assign one. Note that this would be for a *different* CVE than
the one I requested for the Ubuntu vulnerability a minute ago. This
vulnerability here affects a different set of kernels and uses a
different vector.
