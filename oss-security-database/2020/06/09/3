            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2020-0543 / XSA-320

           Special Register Buffer speculative side channel

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

This issue is related to the MDS and TAA vulnerabilities.  Please see
https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-297.html (MDS) and
https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html (TAA) for details.

Certain processor operations microarchitecturally need to read data from
outside the physical core (e.g. to communicate with the random number
generator).  In some implementations, this operation is called a Special
Register Read.

In some implementations, data are staged in a single shared buffer, and
a full cache line at a time is returned to the core which made the
Special Register Read.  On parts vulnerable to MFBDS or TAA, an attacker
may be able to access stale data requested by other cores in the system.

For more details, see:
  https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00320.html

IMPACT
======

An attacker, which could include a malicious untrusted user process on a
trusted guest, or an untrusted guest, can sample the contents of
certain off-core accesses by other cores in the system.

This can include data whose use may depend on the secrecy of the value,
such as data from the Random Number Generator (e.g. RDRAND/RDSEED
instructions).

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

Only x86 processors are vulnerable.
ARM processors are not believed to be vulnerable.

Only Intel based processors are affected.  Processors from other
manufacturers (e.g. AMD) are not believed to be vulnerable.

Please consult the Intel Security Advisory for details on the affected
processors.

MITIGATION
==========

There is no mitigation available.

RESOLUTION
==========

New microcode is being released on affected parts to work around the
vulnerability.  It may be available via a firmware update (consult your
hardware vendor), or available for OS loading (consult your dom0 OS
vendor).

On Xen 4.13 and later, OS microcode can be loaded at runtime. See
https://xenbits.xen.org/docs/latest/admin-guide/microcode-loading.html#runtime-microcode-loading
for details on the xen-ucode utility.

Loading the microcode, either at boot or at runtime, suffices to
mitigate the issue, as protections are active by default.  The
mitigations do have an impact on latency of individual RDRAND/RDSEED
instructions.

The patches below are for Xen, and offer boot time information, defaults
selection, and opt-out controls.  They are recommended to take, but not
absolutely necessary for protection.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to apply
to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most recent
release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the tip of the
stable branch before applying these patches.
