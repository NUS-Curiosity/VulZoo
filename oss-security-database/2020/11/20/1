As it often happens to me, what I wrote was too brief to be clear to
everyone.

The longer version would be something like:

  This is an example of a situation where no one filed for a CVE because
  of perceived hurdles in the process, even if the facts didn't justify
  the perception.

Now of course Moritz tells us there is in fact a CVE and indeed I can
locate the issue in Debian's security tracker. I guess it has been
judged not serious enough to need fixing in buster. I disagree but
clearly that is up to the maintainers.
