Subject: CVE-2020-27617 QEMU: net: an assert failure via eth_get_gso_type

   Hello,

An assert(3) failure issue was found in the networking helper functions of 
QEMU. It could occur in the eth_get_gso_type() routine, if a packet does not 
have a valid networking L3 protocol (ex. IPv4, IPv6) value. A guest user may 
use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host resulting in DoS scenario.

Upstream patch:
---------------
   -> https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/qemu-devel/2020-10/msg06023.html

This issue was reported by Gaoning Pan of Zhejiang University.

Thank you.
