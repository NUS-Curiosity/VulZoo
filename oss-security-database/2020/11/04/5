Subject: RE: Linux kernel: crypto: bcm - Verify GCM/CCM key
 length in setkey(Internet mail)

Hi Tausif,
    I submitted the request in 2020/10/09. except for an auto replay email "CVE Request 971543 for CVE ID Request(Internet mail)", I got no response until now. I wonder whether they ignore personal request.

Regards,
kiyin.
