CVE-2020-1942: Apache NiFi information disclosure in logs

Severity: Important

Versions Affected: Apache NiFi 0.0.1 - 1.11.0

Description: The flow fingerprint factory generated flow fingerprints which included sensitive property descriptor values. In the event a node attempted to join a cluster and the cluster flow was not inheritable, the flow fingerprint of both the cluster and local flow was printed, potentially containing sensitive values in plaintext.

Mitigation: Implemented Argon2 secure hashing to provide a deterministic loggable value which does not reveal the sensitive value. Users running any previous NiFi release should upgrade to the latest release.

Released: February 4, 2020

If you identify new security issues within the NiFi 1.11.1 release, please forward your report to security@...i.apache.org <mailto:security@...i.apache.org> and do not disclose the issue publicly.
