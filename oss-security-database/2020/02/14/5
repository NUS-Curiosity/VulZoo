To echo Simon's points:

Usually, if the code owner (here, the installer's) can fix it in their
own code to avoid the vulnerability, then you can reach out to ask for
a CVE. That being said, CVE issuing is a subjective science, and the
CNA you end up dealing with may decide not to issue one if it is
already dealt with in the underlying libraries.


Good luck!
