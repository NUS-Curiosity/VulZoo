Regarding the affected versions,
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1801405#c6 points out that
the issue is caused by the upsteram commit
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/screen.git/commit/?h=screen-v4&id=c5db181b6e017cfccb8d7842ce140e59294d9f62
which would be only in v4.7.0.

Is this correct?
