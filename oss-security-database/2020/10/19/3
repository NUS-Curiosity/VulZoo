I sure hope that doesn't become the _only_ way, or I'll have some dark
thoughts about the person who proposed it ;-) In any case I'll probably
be dead by the time any of this is implemented, so maybe he has no
worries.

I transfer between XA_PRIMARY and XA_SECONDARY using the Emacs
*scratch* buffer as a way station. The only way I'm even physically able
to drag is using pointer keys, ie. keypad Insert followed by keypad arrow
keys followed by keypad Delete. And no I don't fit any of the predefined
"disabled" pigeonholes so various accessibility kits do nothing for me.

XWindow and desktops based on it have many flaws including security
ones, but it is flexible enough to be usable by "different" folks like
me. Which of the modern replacements can say that, or even has
actionable plans to address that?
