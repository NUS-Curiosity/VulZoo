Yes, I agree the default should be changed.

Just note that there is a reasonable amount of software install
instructions that assume umask is 022 and will install software with
unusable permissions if it is not.

Perhaps the worst example I can think of is Docker image builds.
COPY/ADD will install the files in the Docker image with their current
permissions with no way to override. So all the files inside the image
unreadable for everyone except by root. If you want to run stuff inside
the Docker image as non-root (which is recommended) you either have to
fix the permissions first or add a RUN command to fix the permissions -
which can be slow and the layer generated can be large (due to the
inefficient way layers are represented in Docker).
