Subject: Xen Security Advisory 347 v2 - unsafe AMD IOMMU page table updates

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

                    Xen Security Advisory XSA-347
                              version 2

                  unsafe AMD IOMMU page table updates

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

AMD IOMMU page table entries are updated in a step by step manner,
without regard to them being potentially in use by the IOMMU.  Therefore
it was possible that the IOMMU would read and then use a half-updated
entry.  Furthermore, updates to Device Table entries lacked suitable
ordering enforcement for certain steps involved in these updates.

In both case the specific outcome heavily depends on how exactly the
compiler translated the affected pieces of code.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest might be able to cause data corruption and data
leaks.  Host or guest Denial of Service (DoS), and privilege
escalation, cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions are potentially vulnerable.

Only x86 systems with AMD, Hygon, or compatible IOMMU hardware are
vulnerable.  Arm systems as well as x86 systems with VT-d hardware or
without any IOMMUs in use are not vulnerable.

Only x86 guests which have physical devices passed through to them can
leverage the vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Not passing through physical devices to untrusted guests will avoid
the vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Paul Durrant of Amazon and Jan Beulich of
SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate set of attached patches resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches described above (or others which are
substantially similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on
public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and administrators.

HOWEVER, deployment of the mitigation is NOT permitted (except where
all the affected systems and VMs are administered and used only by
organisations which are members of the Xen Project Security Issues
Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment on public cloud systems
is NOT permitted.

This is because removal of pass-through devices or their replacement by
emulated devices is a guest visible configuration change, which may lead
to re-discovery of the issue.

Deployment of this mitigation is permitted only AFTER the embargo ends.

AND: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
