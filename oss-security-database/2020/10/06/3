I think it would take a lot of 'training' on why this is not wanted and
setting expectations about how one is supposed to use a computer without
that access. It is hard enough trying to explain to the person who wanted
everything containerized for 'better' security that allowing them to ssh
into the container so they can 'debug it' also removes the security that
they wanted.

That would be useful and trusted if the touch bar has a direct path to the
TCB versus being able to be reprogrammed by the OS. It would also be
helpful if there is a way to weigh 'trust' of a system. Each time a person
installs an app like that, the bar turns more red.. at some level it just
goes amber and turns off the need to press the button anymore. Then if you
are asked if Bob's computer is allowed on the computer, you look at the
touch bar and say 'Nooope'.

 This is mainly to try and give users better education about the tradeoffs
versus them just blind clicking [OK] which many of them will do anyway.
Most users don't really have the time or knowledge to know if XYZ app
really needs some control to work. There is no way to know if something is
like driving without a seatbelt, or driving without working brakes. People
may still do either of them but people do it more often if they have no
'feedback' that it can cause problems.
