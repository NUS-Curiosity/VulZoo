You can get some isolation fairly easily using firejail.

It's not as secure as eg. Qubes, but it's available in most distros and
can be as simple as sticking "firejail" in front of a command.

You can use it to isolate your browser/irc/mail client, or possibly more
importantly your build environment, from your wider home directory.

As usual the arch wiki has good doco:
