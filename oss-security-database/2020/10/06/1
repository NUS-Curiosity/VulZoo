I will skip the whole discussion on access control. However to prove security 
requires going through a Common Criteria certification. The biggest issue is 
that the desktoptop uses dbus instantiation which does not have the auid of 
the requesting process. Meaning audit cannot work.

The fix was kdus. That was rejected. But the issue remains. There cannot be a 
secure desktop without auditing. And no one is really pushing for a desktop 
certification, therefore no one is pushing to fix audit desktop problems.
