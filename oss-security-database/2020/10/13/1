Yes, I'm still seeing this pattern in the academic world.  In general,
shared file systems and an expectation of a generous umask are still very
common in the academic and scientific world, where people routinely work
collaboratively on large data sets and share snippets of code and data
frequently.

I personally still maintain my web pages this way, although I'm not a good
example, of course, and it's on my list to change.  :)  But I have also
still seen this pattern in scientific work.  There's built-in support in
Apache still.

Yes, indeed.  It's certainly not an argument against changing the
defaults; a small amount of additional user work to actively choose to
share something is a better default approach.
