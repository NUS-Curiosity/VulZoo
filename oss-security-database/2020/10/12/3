I'm happy to take primary on any of the above.

It's hard to be backup for this one as it is quite a lot of work
compared to most other tasks.  I'd prefer someone else to pick it up if
possible.  While I don't have the cycles to pick up 13, if you're
willing to consider adding another person from Amazon, I think we could
take primary on this one though.
