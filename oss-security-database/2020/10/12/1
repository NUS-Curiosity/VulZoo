Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2020-13943 Apache Tomcat HTTP/2 Request mix-up

CVE-2020-13943 Apache Tomcat HTTP/2 Request mix-up

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M7
Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M5 to 9.0.37
Apache Tomcat 8.5.1 to 8.5.57

Description:
If an HTTP/2 client exceeded the agreed maximum number of concurrent
streams for a connection (in violation of the HTTP/2 protocol), it was
possible that a subsequent request made on that connection could contain
HTTP headers - including HTTP/2 pseudo headers - from a previous request
rather than the intended headers. This could lead to users seeing
responses for unexpected resources.

Mitigation:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M8 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.38 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.58 or later

Credit:
This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team.
