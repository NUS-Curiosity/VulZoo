Subject: CVE-2020-1759 ceph: secure mode of msgr2 breaks both confidentiality
 and integrity aspects for long-lived sessions

Hello,

A nonce reuse vulnerability was discovered in the secure mode of the
messenger v2 protocol, which can allow an
attacker to forge auth tags and potentially manipulate the data by
leveraging the reuse of a nonce in a session.
Messages encrypted using a reused nonce value are susceptible to serious
confidentiality and integrity attacks.

This flaw was introduced in commit fe387e02b11d ("msg/async, v2: drop
depedency on uint128_t. Clean up onwire
crypto.") and affects all the ceph versions from v14.1.1. Red Hat has
assigned CVE-2020-1759 for this issue.
