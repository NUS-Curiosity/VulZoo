Subject: CVE Request: Linux kernel vsyscall page refcounting error

Linux 5.7 and 5.8 have a bug in the reference counting of the struct
page that backs the vsyscall page.  The result is a refcount
underflow.  This can be triggered by any 64-bit process that is
permitted to use ptrace() or process_vm_readv().  A creative attacker
can probably achieve kernel code escalation by using this bug.

You can prevent the issue from triggering by booting with
vsyscall=xonly or vsyscall=none.  You can also effectively hotpatch a
kernel with suitable hardening options by running the updated test
case noted below -- the test case will underflow the refcount past
zero, preventing further use of the page.  (A real attacker would
carefully underflow it exactly to zero but not past.)  Or you can fix
your kernel.

(No one should be using vsyscall=emulate any more unless they have a
very specific use case that requires it.  vsyscall=xonly is better in
almost all cases.  For some reason, Fedora still seems to be using
emulate mode, though.)
