Subject: CVE-2020-25625 QEMU: usb: hcd-ohci: infinite loop issue while
 processing transfer descriptors

   Hello,

An infinite loop issue was found in the USB OHCI controller emulator of QEMU. 
It could occur while servicing OHCI isochronous transfer descriptors (TD) in 
ohci_service_iso_td routine, as it retires a TD if it has passed its time 
frame. While doing so it does not check if the TD was already processed ones 
and holds an error code in TD_CC. It may happen if the TD list has a loop.

A guest user/process may use this flaw to consume cpu cycles on the host 
resulting in a DoS scenario.
