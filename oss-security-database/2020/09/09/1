I'd be interested to know which agencies don't have a comprehensive
patch policy in place. And how they passed their SP800-53A audits.
SI-2, Flaw Remediation, is part of all baselines.

I usually encounter this as a one-off problem (and not a farm of
specialized machines). In my experience, there will be 500
workstations and servers that can be updated, and one machine that
cannot. The one machine is the damn fax server with some custom board.

But it's hard to debunk facts like a new server will experience a
break-in attempt within 3 minutes of being hung off the internet. It's
a very repeatable experiment. And all the evidence is in the log
files. (I think I have half of China and Europe banned through
iptables).
