A lot of that seems to boil down to "You want to run this random piece of software
to automate the job we're paying you to do?  Forget it."  There is also the odd
"We won't run any software that doesn't have <some number of expensive independent
code audits and certifications> and what you want to do doesn't have those (even
though you claim they do, we think you're lying)."
