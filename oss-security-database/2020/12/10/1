Subject: 2 kernel issues

Hi,

Jann Horn found 2 locking issues in the Linux Kernel tty subsystem, which can be used for
the usual memory corruption things.

Mitre assigned 2 CVEs:

CVE-2020-29660:

A locking inconsistency issue was discovered in the tty subsystem of the Linux kernel through 5.9.13.
drivers/tty/tty_io.c and drivers/tty/tty_jobctrl.c may
allow a read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID,
aka CID-c8bcd9c5be24.
