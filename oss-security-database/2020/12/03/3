Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2020-17527 Apache Tomcat HTTP/2 Request header mix-up

CVE-2020-17527 Apache Tomcat HTTP/2 Request header mix-up

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9
Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M5 to 9.0.39
Apache Tomcat 8.5.1 to 8.5.59

Description:
While investigating Bug 64830 it was discovered that Apache Tomcat could
re-use an HTTP request header value from the previous stream received
on an HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with the subsequent
stream. While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of
the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could leak
between requests.

Mitigation:
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M10 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.40 or later
- Upgrade to Apache Tomcat 8.5.60 or later

Credit:
This issue was identified by the Apache Tomcat Security Team.
