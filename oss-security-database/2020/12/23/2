 fixed in Privoxy 3.0.29 stable)

That is a rather poor experience Fabian, sorry! Took a look at that
incident number and no encrypted message appears on our end. I believe you
did actually send a message but not sure what went wrong. While I can't
directly help, did request the appropriate people follow up with you.
