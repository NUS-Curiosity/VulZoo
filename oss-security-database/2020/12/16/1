Subject: [ANNOUNCE] qemu-security mailing list

   Hello,

* QEMU project has set-up a dedicated mailing list to receive and triage all
   its security issues.

   Please see:
     -> https://www.qemu.org/contribute/security-process/
     -> https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/qemu-security

* If you are a security researcher OR think you've found a potential security
   issue in QEMU, please kindly follow the new process to report your issues.

* This is a moderated mailing list. It is meant for systematic handling of
   QEMU security issues and coordinate their public disclosure.

* Membership of this list is limited to people involved in the analysis and
   triage of QEMU security issues.

* To report QEMU security issues you need/should not subscribe to this list.

* We'd like to invite representatives of security teams who are downstream
   consumers of QEMU to contact the list, if they wish to participate in the
   triage process.

* All members will be required to agree and adhere to the embargo rules and
   restrictions.


Thank you.
