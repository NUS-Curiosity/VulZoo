Subject: Apache Struts 2: CVE-2020-17530: Potential RCE when using forced evaluation

Forced OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw user input in tag
attributes, may lead to remote code execution.

Problem
Some of the tag's attributes could perform a double evaluation if a
developer applied forced OGNL evaluation by using the %{...} syntax.
Using forced OGNL evaluation on untrusted user input can lead to a
Remote Code Execution and security degradation.

Solution
Avoid using forced OGNL evaluation on untrusted user input, and/or
upgrade to Struts 2.5.26 which checks if expression evaluation won't
lead to the double evaluation.

Please read our Security Bulletin for more details:

This vulnerability was identified by:
- Alvaro Munoz - pwntester at github dot com

All developers are strongly advised to perform this action.
