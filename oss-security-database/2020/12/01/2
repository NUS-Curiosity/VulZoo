Subject: CVE-2020-28916 QEMU: e1000e: infinite loop scenario in case of null
 packet descriptor

   Hello,

An infinite loop issue was found in the e1000e device emulator in QEMU. The 
issue could occur while receiving packets via e1000e_write_packet_to_guest() 
routine, if the receive(RX) descriptor has NULL buffer address. A privileged 
guest user may use this flaw to induce a DoS scenario on the host.

Upstream patch:

This issue was reported by Cheol-woo Myung.
