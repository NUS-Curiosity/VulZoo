            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2018-14678 / XSA-274
                              version 2

      Linux: Uninitialized state in x86 PV failsafe callback path

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

CVE assigned.  Fix the title to refer to the failsafe callback path.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Linux has a `failsafe` callback, invoked by Xen under certain
conditions.  Normally in this failsafe callback, error_entry is paired
with error_exit; and error_entry uses %ebx to communicate to
error_exit whether to use the user or kernel return path.

Unfortunately, on 64-bit PV Xen on x86, error_exit is called without
error_entry being called first, leaving %ebx with an invalid value.

IMPACT
======

A rogue user-space program could crash a guest kernel.  Privilege
escalation cannot be ruled out.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only 64-bit x86 PV Linux systems are vulnerable.

All versions of Linux are vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Switching to HVM or PVH guests will mitigate this issue.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by M. Vefa Bicakci, and recognized as a
security issue by Andy Lutorminski.

RESOLUTION
