Subject: [CVE-2018-1273] Apache Ignite impacted by security vulnerability in
 Spring Data Commons

Severity: Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

* Apache Ignite 1.0.0-RC3 to 2.5

Impact:

An unauthenticated remote malicious user (or attacker) can issue requests
against Spring Data REST or Spring Data

Description:

Apache Ignite utilizes Spring Data Common library for some of its
components. The vulnerability affects Apache Ignite users who us Spring
Data REST for
access an Ignite cluster via HTTP and Spring Data. Spring Data Commons,
versions prior to 1.13 to 1.13.10, 2.0 to 2.0.5, and older unsupported
versions, contain a property binder vulnerability caused by improper
neutralization of special elements. An unauthenticated remote malicious
user (or attacker) can supply specially crafted request parameters against
Spring Data REST backed HTTP resources or using Spring Data's
projection-based request payload binding hat can lead to a remote code
execution attack.

Mitigation:

* Upgrade to Apache Ignite 2.6 or later that include Spring Data Commons
versions not vulnerable to the disclosed issue.

Credit:
* Harendra Rai of NCR Corporation discovered the impact of the existing
vulnerability on Apache Ignite.
