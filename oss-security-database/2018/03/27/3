Syzkaller [1] is an unsupervised coverage-guided kernel fuzzer, mostly
targeted at fuzzing the Linux kernel. Since some time ago, bugs found
by syzbot [2], a continuous fuzzing system for syzkaller, are
automatically reported to the kernel maintainers. The dashboard
provides a web interfaces for all the bugs reported by syzbot.

Thanks!
