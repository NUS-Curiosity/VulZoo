To those of you who build Linux-ARM distributions it's important to note
that you'll need one patch past the ESR 52.7.2 release tag to pick up
the libtremor fix.

On 59.0.1 this patch is included in the _BUILD2 and _RELEASE tags, but
because we didn't have an ARM build for ESR there was no _BUILD2
tagging. You will want to build with
https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-esr52/rev/5cd5586a2f48

Please spread the word amongst the linux distro community.
