Subject: CVE-2018-1312: Weak Digest auth nonce generation in mod_auth_digest


CVE-2018-1312: Weak Digest auth nonce generation in mod_auth_digest

Severity: Low

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
httpd 2.2.0 to 2.4.29

Description:
When generating an HTTP Digest authentication challenge, the nonce
sent to prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a
pseudo-random seed.  In a cluster of servers using a common Digest
authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across
servers by an attacker without detection.
               
Mitigation:
All httpd users should upgrade to 2.4.30 or later.

The issue was discovered by Nicolas Daniels.
