I don't know if you've all seen this, but, this is definitely how not to 
run a bug bounty.

And the /r/netsec discussion from reddit

https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/7dc275/bug_bounty_hunter_walks_away_on_30k_bounty_from/

TL;DR
A researcher found major infrastructure issues and after clarification 
of scope managed to compromise a very large part of DJI along with large 
amounts of PII. DJI sicked legal on him and he was forced to walk from a 
$30,000 bug bounty.

This document and story received a large amount of traction in the 
"hacking" community. How many bug hunters will be reporting issues to 
DJI in the future? My guess, not a lot...
