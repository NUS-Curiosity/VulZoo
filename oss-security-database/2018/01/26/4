I 100% agree with Solar's response. We should not limit our freedom to choose how we will handle our intellectual property. That is how I read the original statements below.

Not to cause more discussion, but here is the example of how "universal ethics" work:

I agree (specifically, I had suggested explicit maximum embargo times),
but such rules must not be one and only industry standard.  Anyone or
any project may propose rules, and other projects are welcome to reuse
those rules, but they must not have to - they could as well use
different rules, or none.  At best, a relatively non-controversial
and brief boilerplate could end up being reused by many projects.

> We as a profession should have a clear code of ethics

No.  Let's not use the word ethics.  That word, except when explicitly
referring to a particular person's or group's ethics, implies that when
we (dis)agree or are judging others, we claim to be necessarily right -
but in reality we're necessarily subjective.

This would be just as flawed a concept/term as "responsible disclosure".
(I refrain from using that term as well, except when pointing out just
how unnecessarily judgemental it is - implying that other kinds of
disclosure would have been "irresponsible" - but we're subjective.)

> universal ethics' code

That's an oxymoron.  No such thing can possibly exist.
