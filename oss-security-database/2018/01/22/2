 fixed?

Point is, many "security researchers" overly pretend to work for security 
hiding intention for fame / paper publications / product selling.

Accept unnecessary long embargoes then you support this behaviour but 
might provide patches faster after public release.
Reject unnecessary long embargoes then you discourage this behaviour but 
might provide patches slower after public release next time.

I think the decision is always individual per vulnerability weighting how 
grave/easy to find/abuse it is vs. how interested you are in future early 
reports.
Keeping it individual without public announced maximum embargo time would 
also help prevent folks from jumping to 0daying everything per default:)
