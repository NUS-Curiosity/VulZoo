We (Red Hat) respect the embargo request (although we will often try
to negotiate something a bit more sensible if they make a really
awkward request), but ultimately we want the researchers to come to
us, if we annoy them to much they might stop coming to us and just
drop their results as a 0day at the conference with no heads up.

I'm not sure this is a sustainable approach as researchers who want to
make a name for themselves are faced with the "well if I tell them,
they'll try to ignore my embargo request" which incentivizes them to
not do a coordinated disclosure.
