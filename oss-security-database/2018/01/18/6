Well. The result might be, that they will *not* report the vulnerability
at all, but publish their findings as a 0day at a conference. So the
users security highly benefits, if patches are available right
before/after/during the conference.

This is not the best case, but still better than unpatched, published 0days.

Best regards,
Matthias
