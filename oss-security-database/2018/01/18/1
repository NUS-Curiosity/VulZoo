Subject: How to deal with reporters who don't want their bugs fixed?

Subject says it all: What do you do if you receive a vulnerability 
report, and the reporter requests an embargo at some time in the future 
because that's when their paper/conference presentation/patent 
submission is scheduled?

The obvious approach is to find a prior public report of essentially the 
same bug and fix that (which will work surprisingly often), but let's 
assume that this isn't the case.

Thanks,
Florian
