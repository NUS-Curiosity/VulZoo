Assuming there is no good reason for the embargo (like coordination
with other affected parties), ignore the embargo, fix the bug, and
report the behavior to the conference. Conferences should adopt
policies not to host speakers who request that users be left
unprotected for any extended period for the sake of their own ego
trip.
