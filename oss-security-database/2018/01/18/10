I generally agree with this, but it also creates the risk that reporters 
will simply wait till the maximum time frame fits within their desired 
reporting time.  Which of course delays the reporting of the bug to the 
vendor/project. What I have seen in the past is a negotiated partial 
disclosure where the patch is released with minimum details with the 
line that says "Full details with be released by XXX at YYY conference." 
That way if ego is the factor then the reporter also gets a slight 
teaser for his/her talk. Of course one could just use the patch to get 
the details depending on the issue.
