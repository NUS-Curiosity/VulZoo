    collaboration with Daniel Genkin of University of Pennsylvania and
    University of Maryland, Daniel Gruss of Graz University of
    Technology, Werner Haas of Cyberus Technology, Mike Hamburg of
    Rambus (Cryptography Research Division), Moritz Lipp of Graz
    University of Technology, Stefan Mangard of Graz University of
    Technology, Thomas Prescher of Cyberus Technology, Michael Schwarz
    of Graz University of Technology, and Yuval Yarom of University of
    Adelaide and Data61.
    Impact: Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution
    and branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of
    information to an attacker via a side-channel analysis. This variant
    of the Spectre vulnerability triggers the speculative execution by
    performing a bounds-check bypass. Description: Security improvements
    are included to mitigate the effects.

    Impact: Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution
    and branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of
    information to an attacker via a side-channel analysis. This variant
    of the Spectre vulnerability triggers the speculative execution by
    utilizing branch target injection. Description: Security
    improvements are included to mitigate the effects.
