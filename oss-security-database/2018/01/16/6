Subject: ISC has announced CVE-2017-3144, a defect in ISC DHCP

Please be advised that ISC has publicly announced a vulnerability in
ISC DHCP.

CVE-2017-3144 is a partial denial-of-service vector which can be used
to exhaust the server's pool of socket descriptors if an attacker can
open connections to the server's OMAPI control port.  If successfully
exploited the attacker can prevent the operator from being able to
connect to the server, for example to change server state or to add
lease reservations without restarting the server.

Since an unauthorized client should not be permitted access to this
port under normal circumstances, we are recommending that most operators
should simply secure access to the control port; however a patch which
properly cleans up the hung socket descriptors is available upon request
(and will be included in future maintenance releases.)
