True, yes, harder to brute-force a identical private key, than a key with an identical fingerprint.

However, if someone hadn't considered the possibility of a SHA1 collision attack, and a signature verification fails, despite the fingerprint they see matching, what % of GPG users would skip signature verification?
Perhaps due to confusion/self-doubt/inexperience/other.
Admittedly, this could be stepping into the realm of social engineering.
