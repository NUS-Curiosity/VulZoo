My colleague Jann Horn pointed out evince (which uses libgs, which is
affected with some tweaks to the PoC) is used to generate previews in
Nautilus, which means previews can trigger code execution (see
/usr/share/thumbnailers/evince.thumbnailer). I think it's possible to
trigger that via file automatic download in a browser just by visiting a
URL, but I haven't tested it.

I think those thumbnails should be disabled, but you've probably noticed I
think everything related to untrusted ghostscript should be disabled :-)

Tavis.
