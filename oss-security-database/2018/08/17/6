There seems to be some miscommunation here, which should be directly
clarified with the security team of the affected distribution(s).

Rule of thumb is: when a vendor publishes updates for an issue, the issue
is public and can be referenced publically. I do not understand why you
would get push back unless there are communication problems.

Also FWIW CVE-2018-3690 is an older reference to "Bounds Check Bypass Store",
which is now tracked as CVE-2018-3693 and is public.

Ciao, Marcus
