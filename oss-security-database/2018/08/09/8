Subject: Re: Linux TCP implementation vulnerable to Denial of Service (CVE 2018-5390)

Hi,

Thank you for fighting censorship on what is supposed to be a list for managing security issues of open software. The issue is that it has gone so far from its original idea, with the embargoes and removal of direct CVE requests, that legal action remains the only logical one, for anyone not part of the "club". As to getting some funding to run it properly, I continue to do think it would make sense, if you can ensure independence from a specific organization or government's interest (cc-ing Google, not ITU or Protonmail, arbitrarily, says long on this very issue and the one of Linux governance overall).

Best,
Stiepan A. Kovac
