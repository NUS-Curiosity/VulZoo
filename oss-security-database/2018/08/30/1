I agree about the "key ID" part, but not about the "fingerprint" part.
Pinning a cryptographic hash over a public key isn't a security
antipattern by any strech of the imagination. Sure, you could argue that
the SHA-1 used by GPG isn't state-of-the-art anymore, but we're not
talking about collision attacks, but second preimage attacks. Far worse
for the attacker.

The way you phrased it, however, all applications of fingerprints/hashes
would be broken (SSH fingerprints, HPKP, etc.), regardless of the hash
function they use.

Cheers,
Joe
