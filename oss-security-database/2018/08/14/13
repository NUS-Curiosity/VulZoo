                    Xen Security Advisory XSA-272
                              version 2

               oxenstored does not apply quota-maxentity

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Ammend patch to reference XSA-272 in the commit message.

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The logic in oxenstored for handling writes depended on the order of
evaluation of expressions making up a tuple.

As indicated in section 7.7.3 "Operations on data structures" of the
OCaml manual:

  http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/expr.html

the order of evaluation of subexpressions is not specified.  In
practice, different implementations behave differently.

IMPACT
======

oxenstored may not enforce the configured quota-maxentity.

This allows a malicious or buggy guest to write as many xenstore entries
as it wishes, causing unbounded memory usage in oxenstored.  This can
lead to a system-wide DoS.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.1 and later are potentially vulnerable.

Only systems using the OCaml xenstored implementation are potentially
vulnerable.  Systems using the C xenstored implementation are not
vulnerable.

Whether the compiled oxenstored binary is vulnerable depends on which
compiler was used.  OCaml can be compiled either as bytecode (with
ocamlc) or as a native binary (with ocamlopt).

The following OCaml program demonstrates the issue, and identifies
whether the resulting oxenstored binary will skip the quota enforcement.

  $ cat order.ml
  let check () =
    let flag = ref false in
    let update _ = flag := true; () in
    List.iter update [1;2;3], !flag

  let main () =
    let _, flag = check () in
    if flag then
    print_endline "This code is not vulnerable!"
    else
    print_endline "This code is vulnerable!"

  let () = main ()

  $ ocamlc order.ml -o order.bytecode
  $ ./order.bytecode
  This code is vulnerable!
  $ ocamlopt order.ml -o order.native
  $ ./order.native
  This code is not vulnerable!

To confirm whether an OCaml binary is bytecode or native, use file.

  $ file order.bytecode
  order.bytecode: a /usr/bin/ocamlrun script executable (binary data)
  $ file order.native
  order.native: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ...

NOTE: These results are applicable to OCaml 4.01.0-5 as distributed in
Debian Jessie.  These results are not representative of other versions
of OCaml, or of other OS distributions.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.


(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)
