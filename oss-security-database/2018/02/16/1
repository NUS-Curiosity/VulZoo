Subject: XSS vulnerability in Tiki < 18

Hi,

I've discovered a security issue in Tiki < 18 (https://tiki.org)


A XSS vulnerability via SVG image allows an authenticated user to gain
administrator privileges if an administrator opens a wiki page with a
malicious SVG image, related to filegallib.php.


Fix:
https://sourceforge.net/p/tikiwiki/code/65327


The issue is fixed in Tiki 18.


I've requested a CVE ID (MITRE).
