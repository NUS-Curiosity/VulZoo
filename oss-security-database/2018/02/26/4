Subject: Re: [ANNOUNCE] CVE-2018-1286 - Apache OpenMeetings - Insufficient
 Access Controls

Hi Maxim,

I got your point, however, the description seems to be stating that only
version *3.0.0* is affected instead of *<=4.0.1*.


CVE-2018-1286 - Apache OpenMeetings - Insufficient Access Controls
Severity: Medium

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

*Versions Affected: Apache OpenMeetings 3.0.0*

* Versions Affected: <= 4.0.1  (Corrected)*

Description: CRUD operations on privileged users are not password protected
allowing an authenticated attacker to deny service for privileged users.
CVE-2018-1286

The issue was fixed in 4.0.2
All users are recommended to upgrade to Apache OpenMeetings 4.0.2


Thanks,
~ Sahil
