Subject: [CVE-2017-15712] Apache Oozie Server vulnerability

Apache Oozie is a workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs.

Severity: Severe

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Oozie 3.1.3-incubating to Oozie 4.3.0
Oozie 5.0.0-beta1

Description:
Vulnerability allows a user of Oozie to expose private files on the Oozie
server process.  The malicious user can construct a workflow XML file
containing XML directives and configuration that reference sensitive files
on the Oozie server host.

Mitigation:
Users should upgrade to Apache Oozie 4.3.1 release from
http://oozie.apache.org/ .
Users should use 5.0.0-beta1 release only for testing purposes and wait for
the 5.0.0 GA which will have the fix.
