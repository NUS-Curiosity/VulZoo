If you are not sure how to pass flags to the compiler when building UnZip 6.0
(the Makefile does not respect CFLAGS), you should export them as LOCAL_UNZIP in
the build environment. Quoting 'unix/Makefile':

# LOCAL_UNZIP is an environment variable that can be used to add default C flags
# to your compile without editing the Makefile (e.g., -DDEBUG_STRUC, or -FPi87
# on PCs using Microsoft C).

It took me a little too long to figure that out...
