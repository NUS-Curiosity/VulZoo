Subject: GNU patch out of bounds read, null pointer crash and double free

The recent release of GNU patch 2.7.6 fixed an old out of bounds read I
had reported in 2015:

out of bounds read with malformed patch in pch_write_line
https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?45990

Commit:
https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/patch.git/commit/src/pch.c?id=a0d7fe4589651c64bd16ddaaa634030bb0455866

I re-checked patch now and found a few more issues:

segfault / null pointer (probably crash only)

double free in function another_hunk()
