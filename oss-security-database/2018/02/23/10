Subject: [SECURITY] CVE-2017-15693 Apache Geode unsafe deserialization of
 application objects

CVE-2017-15693 Apache Geode unsafe deserialization of application objects

Severity:  Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:  Apache Geode 1.0.0 through 1.3.0

Description:
The Geode server stores application objects in serialized form.
Certain cluster operations and API invocations cause these objects to
be deserialized.  An user with DATA:WRITE access to the cluster may be
able to cause remote code execution if certain classes are present on
the classpath.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.4.0 or
later.  In addition, users should set the flags
validate-serializable-objects and serializable-object-filter.

Credit:
This issue was reported responsibly to the Apache Geode Security Team
by Man Yue Mo from Semmle.
