CVE-2017-15695 Apache Geode remote code execution vulnerability

Severity:  Important

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:  Apache Geode 1.0.0 through 1.4.0

Description:

DATA:WRITE privileges is allowed to deploy code by invoking an
internal Geode function.  This allows remote code execution.  Code
deployment should be restricted to users with DATA:MANAGE privilege.

Mitigation:
Users of the affected versions should upgrade to Apache Geode 1.5.0 or later.
