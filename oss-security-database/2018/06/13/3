Hi Yves-Alexis,

Any updates on this?

By the way, it might be the occasion to switch to more future-proof signatures, such as
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8391 , which are reputed as quantum-safe and do not depend on some hardness assumptions.
We could help with an open-source implem. if needed.
Apparently, NIST is also moving into that direction for software signatures, according to information given now at ETSI's security week.
