Subject: Intel FP security issue

Hi All,

Both OpenBSD and DragonflyBSD have gone ahead and committed fixes for
the rumored Intel FP issue:

OpenBSD: https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&m=152818076013158&w=2
DragonflyBSD: http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/commits/2018-June/672324.html

I think that the cat is already out of the bag, and releasing details
of this security problem makes sense. Since this has gone public, Is
there a reason to keep this under embargo ?

Kind regards,
