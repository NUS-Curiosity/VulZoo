Subject: CVE-2018-12020 in GnuPG

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

Hi everybody,

just a heads up, since we weren't notified in advance and it's Friday evening
(in Europe at least).

There's a nasty vulnerability in GnuPG which can be apparently used to bypass
signature verification when a program calls gpg to verify a signature and
parses the output:

https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2018q2/000425.html
https://dev.gnupg.org/T4012

It might be worth checking whether package managers signature verification is
affected.

Apt doesn't seems affected at first sight (it uses gpgv) but we'll double
check.

Regards,
