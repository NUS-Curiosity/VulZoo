Subject: [CVE-2018-8008] Apache Storm arbitrary file write vulnerability

CVE-2018-8008: Apache Storm arbitrary file write vulnerability

Severity: Important

Vendor:
The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:
Apache Storm 1.2.1
Apache Storm 1.1.2

Description:
Apache Storm version 1.0.6 and earlier, 1.2.1 and earlier, and version 1.1.2 and earlier expose an arbitrary file write vulnerability, that can be achieved using a specially crafted zip archive (affects other archives as well, bzip2, tar, xz, war, cpio, 7z), that holds path traversal filenames. So when the filename gets concatenated to the target extraction directory, the final path ends up outside of the target folder.

Mitigation:
1.2.1 users should upgrade to version 1.2.2.
1.1.2 users should upgrade to version 1.1.3.
1.0.6 users should upgrade to version 1.1.3.

Apache Storm 1.2.2 artifacts are available for immediate download here:
