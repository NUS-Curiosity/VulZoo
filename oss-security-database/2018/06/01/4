Hello Stefan,

Like Henri and certainly others, I've been appreciating the technical
content from your advisories for years. The tone sometimes looked dry,
even slightly abrasive, but it was tolerable.

This time, I think that you're going too far - well into the aggressive,
arrogant, abusive territory. It's not the technical background, which
remains sound as usual, it's the tone.
Sure, Pete's first reply wasn't fully nice, but clearly, to begin with,
you could have done *a lot* better (more constructive) than
1) posting about "bloody beginners" and failing to post details about
what's wrong with that installer. That's what he rightfully pointed.
Pete is usually nice enough to nice people, you know.
2) getting on your high horses in your reply to his reply.

Do you understand how your posts can come across as negative,
interfering with the otherwise interesting meaning of your posts ?
Toning down on those aspects will reduce the likelihood of derailing
issue reports, and damaging your reputation over the long term.


Two cents from a bystander, anyway.


Regards,
Lionel.
