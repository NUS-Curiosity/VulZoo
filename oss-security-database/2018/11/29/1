Subject: CVE-2018-19665 Qemu: bt: integer overflow in Bluetooth routines
 allows memory corruption

   Hello,

An integer overflow resulting in memory corruption issue was found in various 
Bluetooth functions. It could occur in routines wherein 'len' parameter is a 
'signed int' which subsequently converts to an unsigned integer resulting in 
memcpy() copying large amounts of memory.

A user inside guest could use this flaw to crash the Qemu process resulting in 
DoS.

Upstream patch:

This issue was reported by Arash TC

Thank you.
