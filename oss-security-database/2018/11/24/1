GraphicsMagick also bundles some version of dcraw for its Microsoft 
Windows builds.  It is executed as an external program so if it 
becomes corrupted, it will not corrupt the invoking application.

Another consideration is that the dcraw author has huge sample image 
archive that he is only willing to sell for private use.  This means 
that other projects (including those which derived code from dcraw) 
might not work correctly with as many input files since they have not 
done as much validation.
