Subject: Re: Using quilt on untrusted RPM spec files

Fedora avoids the problem by running rpmbuild in a chroot mini 
container (provided by systemd) as the mockbuild user with no network 
access - this extracts source, does %prep, etc.   This is done with the 
'mock' utility.  The reviewer can still examine the prepped source in 
the host filesystem.  The reviewer can also run commands inside the 
mock chroot container, install additional packages (like vim), get a 
shell inside the container, etc.
