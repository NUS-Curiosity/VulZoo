Subject: Re: GCC Compiler Induced Vulnerability - affects
 programs compiled with GCC 7 and 8 containing nested functions

Hello,

It was described in GCC documentation even from 2003:

https://web.archive.org/web/20030207183940/http://gcc.gnu.org:80/onlinedocs/gccint/Trampolines.html

What's difference between vulnerability you found and behavior that
was described in the documentation?
