Due to its valuable current usages (e.g. printing and format 
conversion) and its long legacy, Postscript is still a vital format to 
support in open source software.

How can software consuming Postscript be aware of its origin unless it 
is known to be produced directly by another application?

Edge applications such as web browsers may be able to help by adding 
warning dialogs when knowingly downloading Postscript content.
