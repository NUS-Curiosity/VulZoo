A small update, one of these commits was to mark all procedures that use
dangerous operators as operators themselves. The idea is that error
handlers will only see the top-level operator and not any sub-operators (I
know, this is getting complicated).

I noticed a procedure upstream missed, .loadfontloop. Upstream have double
checked if there were any others, and I did too - we think that is all of
them.

So this commit is necessary as well:

Thanks, Tavis.
