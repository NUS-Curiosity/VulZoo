It seems to be a bug that this directory is under /usr/share, and not
under /etc where admins could modify it to selectively disable things.  I
checked and there is no parallel /etc/thumbnailers directory to drop
overriding entries into - though maybe ~/.local/share/thumbnailers would
work?  But already the fact that I have to guess is a bug :-(

By the way, on fedora the /usr/share/thumbnailers entry indeed does
belong to the evince package, but there is a separate evince-nautilus
package and its description says:

: This package contains the evince extension for the nautilus file manager.
: It adds an additional tab called "Document" to the file properties dialog.

Do you think that removing evince-nautilus would eliminate the nautilus
attack vector at least?
