Ah OK, I got confused (having not used gnome or nautilus for a long 
time) of what exactly Nautilus' role is here. Because Tavis mentioned 
web browsing and nautilus together in my mind I was thinking nautilus 
was the web browser here forgot it's a file manager :-)

But I'm still unclear how "just browsing a website is enough to trigger 
the vulnerability in some common configurations." Are we talking about 
the user looking in their web browser cache directory on the filesystem 
using Nautilus, and hence running malicious code embedded in a cached 
file via the evince thumbnailer on opening that directory? Or maybe 
Nautilus/Gnome automatically runs the thumbnailer on every new file 
created in the user's home directory (via inotify?), including whatever 
the browser saves in the background (hopefully not)? Or is it just a 
case of the user opening a downloaded file with evince and becoming a 
victim that way? Though that is not exactly automatic, most browsers 
show a prompt asking what to do with a downloaded file.

So, still slightly confused, how one can become a victim here just 
browsing a website. It's probably obvious to everyone but I'm not 
getting it having always run a quite minimal desktop for years 
(currently a mixture of Awesome window manager + some Mate elements, 
caja file manager) .... Or maybe no-one wants to spell it out so as not 
to give the bad guys any free tips. So feel free to ignore me if it's 
either of those :-)
