SECURITY-1186
The Groovy Sandbox library used by Script Security Plugin and Pipeline Groovy
Plugin did not apply sandbox restrictions to finalize methods. This could be
used to invoke arbitrary constructors and methods, bypassing sandbox
protection.

Finalize methods are now prohibited in classes subject to sandbox security.
