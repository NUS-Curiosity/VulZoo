The term "control character" has a standard definition for every encoding
I'm familiar with.  ASCII defined a set of control characters, and
Unicode built on them.

The Unicode list of control characters is here:
https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Cc/list.htm
You'll see it includes:
U+0007 	BELL
U+0008 	BACKSPACE
U+0009 	CHARACTER TABULATION
U+000A 	LINE FEED (LF)
U+000C 	FORM FEED (FF) (aka ^L)
U+000D 	CARRIAGE RETURN (CR)
U+007F 	DELETE

According to Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII>,
the set of control characters in US-ASCII is 00..1F and 7F (hex).

As you noted, that definition doesn't match the ASCII definition, but
I also think it's misleading.  If someone pastes a CR/LF into a shell prompt,
it certainly *DOES* cause an action, namely, execution of that line.
That's probably not what you meant by "action", but from a security
point-of-view, causing a script to execute is rather important :-).
