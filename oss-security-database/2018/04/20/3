~~~~~~~~~~~
Lee Yarwood (Red Hat) reported a vulnerability in Nova encrypted
volumes handling. By detaching and reattaching an encrypted volume an
attacker may access the underlying raw volume and corrupt the LUKS
header resuling in a denial of service attack on the compute host. All
Nova setups supporting encrypted volumes are affected.
