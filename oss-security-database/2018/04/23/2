Subject: CVE-2018-1110: Knot Resolver <= 2.2.0 Improper Input Validation

Hello,

Knot Resolver software version <= 2.2.0 suffers from Improper Input
Validation bugs which allow remote attacker to crash the resolver by
sending specially crafted packets.

Fixes
=====
Knot Resolver 2.3.0 fixes all known security bugs and is available from
https://www.knot-resolver.cz/download/

Backports
=========
To fix the bugs we had to do major changes to some data structures so
backport it most likely not feasible. We are discontinuing support for
*all* versions older than 2.3.0 and discourage attempts to backport
fixes because these will most likely introduce additional bugs.
