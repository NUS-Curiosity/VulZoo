Please use a CWE identifier if one exists (https://cwe.mitre.org/), if one
doesn't exist perhaps we should have one (email me and I'm happy to help
get that ball rolling). Having a CWE not only helps categorize things
correctly but gives us something to point developers at for resources
around flaws and how they can be avoided/dealt with/etc.
