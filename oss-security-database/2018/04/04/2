Subject: Linux Kernel Defence Map

Linux kernel security is a very complex area. It would be nice to have some
graphical representation of its current state. So I've created a Linux Kernel
Defence Map showing the relations between:
 - vulnerability classes / exploitation techniques,
 - kernel defences,
 - bug detection means.

Link:
   https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/linux-kernel-defence-map

N.B. The node connections don't mean "full mitigation". These connections
represent some kind of relation. So ideally, this map should help to navigate in
documentation and Linux kernel sources.

I wrote it in DOT language and generated the picture using GraphViz. So it is
very pleasant to maintain this map with git.

I would be grateful for any feedback.

Best regards,
Alexander
