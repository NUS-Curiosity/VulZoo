Subject: [CVE-2018-1335] Command Injection Vulnerability in Apache Tika’s tika-server module

CVE-2018-1335 – Command Injection Vulnerability in Apache Tika’s tika-server
module


Severity: High



Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation



Versions Affected: <1.18



Description: Before Tika 1.18, clients could send carefully crafted

headers to tika-server that could be used to inject commands into the

command line of the server running tika-server.  This vulnerability

only affects those running tika-server on a server that is open to

 untrusted clients.



Mitigation: Ensure that untrusted users don't have access to

tika-server and/or upgrade to Apache Tika >=1.18.
