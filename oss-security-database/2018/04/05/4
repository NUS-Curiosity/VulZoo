Just got an idea to call it "userspace data access". Short and simple!

I also combined SMAP/PAN and UDEREF into a cluster to reduce the number of
edges. Now it looks a bit better.

Ok. Created a CFI cluster with RAP and Clang CFI inside.

However, I didn't manage to find any materials about applying Clang CFI to the
Linux kernel.
