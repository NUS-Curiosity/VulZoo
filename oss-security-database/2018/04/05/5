Well, naming can get confusing here. RAP got renamed along the way to
include both "Return Address Protection" (backward edge) and "Indirect
Control Transfer Protection" (forward edge). Clang CFI is forward edge
only, though things like shadow stacks or pointer authentication can
provide backward edge protection. So... I'm not sure how much detail
you want to capture in the bubbles. :)

Here's Sami Tolvanen's work on doing Clang CFI (on top of Clang LTO):
