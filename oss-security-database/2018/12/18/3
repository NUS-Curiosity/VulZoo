Subject: Re: CVE-2018-20124 QEMU: rdma: OOB access when building
 scatter-gather array

Thanks all :) I'm happy it fixed, thanks for the response guys!

I'm wondering why it says "DOS" and not "execute arbitrary code on the
host, in the context of the QEMU process"? I have stack overflow, it pretty
clear I could gain more than simple DOS:)

What do your day?
