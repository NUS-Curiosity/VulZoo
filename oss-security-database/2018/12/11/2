GNU inetutils telnet is a fork of the original BSD telnet code, but most of
the BSD's seem to have already switched to snprintf a while ago:

https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/telnet/telnet.c.diff?r1=1.3&r2=1.4&f=h
https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/commit/d2f83e4ec488ec62281318b26dad107e65d96d0c#diff-3503402e6a2ad1eb960a4f475f19fb9f

with NetBSD as the outlier:
http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/usr.bin/telnet/telnet.c?rev=1.36&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&only_with_tag=MAIN

illumos also uses snprintf, in the code it inherited from OpenSolaris:
