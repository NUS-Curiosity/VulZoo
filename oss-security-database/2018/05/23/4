So the classic CVE statement for this is "does it cross/violate a trust
boundary". Yeah I know, not super helpful.

In general when I look at something and need to decide whether or not it
deserves/needs a CVE the fundamentals are:

1) Can an attacker use this vulnerability to gain access, additional
privileges, basically is there an impact to
Confidentiality/Availability/Integrity? This is really two tests: is there
an impact, and is there a way for the attacker to trigger or exploit it?
That's a CVE.

2) Does the software/system make a specific security claim that they then
fail to meet? E.g. "we include a firewall that blocks access to everything
inbound except for port 22", if they were to then also allow port 80,
that'd be a CVE.

So for the syzbot stuff mostly what you need to determine is:

a) is there a security related impact?
AND
b) can an attacker trigger it?

If both are yes, then a CVE is warranted.
