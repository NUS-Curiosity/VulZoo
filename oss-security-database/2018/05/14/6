The fix for this has been merged into 4.17-rc5 as commit 27ae357fa82b 
("mm, oom: fix concurrent munlock and oom reaper unmap, v3"), see 
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=27ae357fa82be5ab73b2ef8d39dcb8ca2563483a

Furthermore, it has been staged for inclusion in both the 4.14 and 4.16 
stable kernels.
