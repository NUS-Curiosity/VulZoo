Hi Kurt,

Perhaps I should've been more clear. I wasn't asking "what qualifies
for a CVE?", but rather "There are a 100 bugs that qualify for CVEs,
how do single out 10 of them to actually request CVEs for?".

In particular, the 100 bugs that I'm referring to are the bugs
reported by syzbot (perhaps there's even more:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/?fixed=upstream) and the 10 bugs (or so)
are the ones Vladis announced on oss-security over the last few
months. I'm just curious how did he choose those 10 bugs out of that
100+.

Thanks!
