Hi Stefan,

Thank you very much for your very depreciative and less than informative 
report.

Since a vulnerability report works a lot better with an actual 
exploitation scenario conducted with the actual application, that we can 
look into, we will be waiting on that from you.

Also, FYI, we did apply mitigation for #1 (DLL sideloading attacks) very 
shortly after the time it became publicized:
https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/commit/8473e9ef561295fd10dd9526010c1fd1cb1e6701

And of course, with proper non disparaging involvement of security 
researchers, who subscribe to the established responsible disclosure 
policy of their profession, we are always eager to improve on our 
mitigation fixes, if it turns out they aren't adequate.

However, we would appreciate if you refrained from jumping to erroneous 
conclusion about Rufus development being conducted by "bloody 
beginners", when it is clear that some of the "beginner's" 
vulnerabilities you list have long had some mitigation factors applied.

All the best,

/Pete
