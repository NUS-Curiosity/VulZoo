Subject: Re: announcing sponsorship; distros list statistics for 2023

Hi,

Here's an update:

All components of the oss-security and (linux-)distros infrastructure,
including not only the mailing lists but also the web archive and wiki,
have recently been migrated to new hosting location in the Netherlands.
Due to this location and the proximity to AMS-IX, the websites should
now feel a bit faster from many parts of the world.

This migration was done in several stages, and (due to low DNS RR TTLs
and old resources staying up for a while) should have been transparent.
I anticipate some further transparent, behind-the-scenes changes this
year, such as for better preparedness to restore resources onto backup
infrastructure within a day if we ever have to.

Some further updates inline:

The statistics above now cover all of 2023, with 93 total reports.

No further issues were mishandled like that.

I continued to add these, so we now have all 12 of these for 2023.

Also, the headers-only archives of the private lists last announced in:

https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/15/3

have since been updated to cover the period through the end of 2023.
