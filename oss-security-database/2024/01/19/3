https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2024-01-09 states:

> GNUTLS-SA-2024-01-09
> CVE-2024-0567
> Severity Medium; Denial of service
> When validating a certificate chain which contains a cycle of cross-signed signatures of multiple CA certificates, GnuTLS applications crash with an assertion failure. This affects GnuTLS 3.7.0 to 3.8.2. The issue was reported in the issue tracker as #1521 <https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1521> > Recommendation: To address the issue found upgrade to GnuTLS 3.8.3 or later 
versions.

https://gnutls.org/security-new.html#GNUTLS-SA-2024-01-14 states:

> GNUTLS-SA-2024-01-14
> CVE-2024-0553
> Severity Medium; more timing sidechannel in RSA-PSK key exchange
> The previous fix for CVE-2023-5981 turned to be incomplete as it still leaves an observable difference in the response times to malformed ciphertexts in RSA-PSK ClientKeyExchange and the one of ciphertexts with correct PKCS#1 v1.5 padding. Only TLS ciphertext processing is affected. The issue was reported in the issue tracker as #1522 <https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1522>.
> Recommendation: To address the issue found upgrade to GnuTLS 3.8.3 or later versions.
