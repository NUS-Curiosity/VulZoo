The problem with disabling unprivileged userns is that in the desktop
Linux case it actually causes serious problems, because creating a
sandbox is now a privileged operation.  IMO Landlock + seccomp is a much
better solution for sandboxing, but I don't think it can do everything
browsers need yet.

For containers, I'm not aware of a good solution right now.
