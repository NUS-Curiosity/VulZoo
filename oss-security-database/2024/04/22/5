In flatpak, apps in container communicate with host through portals[1] using dbus.
Portals identify particular app through unique appid (i.e. "org.mozilla.firefox"
for firefox) and grant some permissions according to that. appid is read from
/.flatpak-info that exist inside container and is immutable there. If namespaces
were available inside sandbox then malicious app could leverage mount namespace
to mount crafted /.flatpak-info containing arbitrary data and lie to the portal
about appid - it could tell portal that it's org.mozilla.firefox when it isn't.
