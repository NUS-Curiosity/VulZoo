That's fair enough; I rather was attempting to indicate which distro
from a family we used, "~11k Arch packages (on EndeavourOS)", similar to
testing on Rocky as a representative of the RPM ecosystem, etc. We did
not analyze any AUR packages (yet? seems like we could, and if we could
we should).

These same corpuses will be used for continued m4 analysis; so far we've
only done the m4 spelunking on Gentoo.

That reminds me, we did not specify what release-trains we tested for
each; our goal was to pick one that had (or had had, and been rolled
back) a backdoored xz-utils version (5.6.0 / 5.6.1) if we could:

- Debian sid

- EndeavourOS 2024.01.25

- Gentoo as-of 2024-04-18

- Rocky 9.3

Thanks,
