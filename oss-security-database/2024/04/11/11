Hi,

The two exploit versions are for different kernels. The 6.5 exploit 
doesn't compile on the Debian 12 6.1 kernel, and no Debian version 
currently distributes a 6.5 kernel, AFAICT. I used 
ExploitGSM_5_15_to_6_1/ExploitGSM and it worked.

Possibly. I'm definitely out of my depth trying to analyze which bugs 
are being exploited.

Apparently not. Debian 12 "Bookworm" currently runs this kernel:

Linux debianexploitgsm 6.1.0-18-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Debian 
6.1.76-1 (2024-02-01) x86_64 GNU/Linux

According to the changelog, this kernel has the fix for CVE-2023-52564 
included:
     - Revert "tty: n_gsm: fix UAF in gsm_cleanup_mux"
(from 
https://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs//main/l/linux-signed-amd64/linux-signed-amd64_6.1.76+1_changelog)

Still, the exploit works, so it must exploit a different issue.

Just my two cents,
