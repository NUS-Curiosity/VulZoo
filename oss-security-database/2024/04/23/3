Subject: Re: 83 bogus CVEs assigned to Robot Operating System (ROS)

Thank you for your detailed overview regarding the CVEs attributed to our
research on ROS/ROS 2. We appreciate the scrutiny and understand the
concerns raised by you and other parties.

I want to clarify that our findings are based on extensive tests conducted
in real-world scenarios within controlled laboratory settings, where actual
robots were subjected to attacks. This method is crucial as it transcends
theoretical analysis and involves direct interaction with the equipment
that is still operational in many industrial sectors, although on
unsupported ROS/ROS2 versions.

We acknowledge that the CVE descriptions were initially drafted at a high
level and may not have included comprehensive technical details. This was
due to pending publication of our full research papers, which delve deeper
into the specifics of each vulnerability. We are preparing a separate
document to address this gap, providing the evidence and methodologies
employed during our research.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that while some ROS versions are no longer
supported by the official development team, they are still actively used in
various industries. Our work aims to highlight security risks that could
affect these legacy systems, thereby aiding in proactive cybersecurity
measures.

We are open to dialogue and further investigation by third-party experts.
If the consent remains suspicious of the vulnerability claims, we are
prepared to request revocation of the CVEs to maintain the integrity of the
reporting process. Our primary goal is to contribute positively to the
security of the robotic ecosystem, and we are committed to transparency and
collaboration to achieve this.

Looking forward to your constructive feedback and hoping for an opportunity
to discuss our findings in detail.
