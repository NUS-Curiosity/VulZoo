The fix we provided for CVE-2024-31083 introduced a double-free in some
circumstances, which led to X server crashes.

This has been fixed now in xorg-server-21.1.13 and xwayland-23.2.6.

For those applying patches instead of upgrades, see
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/commit/337d8d48b618d4fc0168a7b978be4c3447650b04
