Subject: Just a reminder to never run ldd or strings on untrusted binaries 

I'm not sure if people are aware of the fact that ldd can run the executable under certain circumstances. Also running strings on a malicious file can be a bad idea:

This advice would extend to other common tools as well, like objdump and readelf.
