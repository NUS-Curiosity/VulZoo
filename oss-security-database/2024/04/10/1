And I assume "etc" includes access control via hosts.deny?


  So in other words, people who had a backdored sshd running, that
  was only protected via hosts.deny may have actually been compromised?

  Unless[0] of course, access was blocked by netfilter, some
  other firewall, router, etc. ... or sshd wasn't even running.

Right?

[0] And this assumes that no home calling (like automatic command/code
    pulling from the adversary, or submission of e.g. found private
    keys) and no further attack vectors (other than via sshd) or
    infestations (like creating new users or authorized_keys entries)
    are to be found...
    ... which AFAIU is not yet definitely ruled out?
