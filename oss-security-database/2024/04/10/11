That's a theory. But many of the commits with author Jia Tan in those
time zones have committer Lasse Collin, and show signs of being eg,
git-amed patch sets which may have also been rebased. In which case
it would make sense that these have Lasse Collin's usual timezone.

I analized that here: https://hachyderm.io/@joeyh/112193146103113070
