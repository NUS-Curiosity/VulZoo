Lasse has already hinted at the reasons for why some of these things are
the way they are. Spoiler: normal boring maintainer edits.

But I really think we ought to wait for Lasse's article before
speculating any further about timezones and commit logs: He has stated
on <https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/> that 1) an article is in the works
but 2) cleaning up the repository currently has priority, and 3) he
receives far more email than he can respond to.
