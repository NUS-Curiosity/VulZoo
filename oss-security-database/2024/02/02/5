I raised these objections on some IETF list or another, and was
rebuffed.  According to the MTA-STS project, DNS is too hard or people
are too stupid, so MTA-STS ignores DNSSEC and relies on HTTPS and
well-known urls.  I would like it to be on the record, at least, that
someone tried to talk them out of this.  I did point out that requring
an entire additional stack of protocols just to look up a port number
was not as clever as just specifying the port number, but that idea was
also rejected.
