Even that isn't true any more in 2024. The largest mail providers (and
plenty of small ones) all support MTA-STS. So in most cases,
certificate validity and hostnames are checked.

Doubtful:
host -t txt _mta-sts.yahoo.com
_mta-sts.yahoo.com descriptive text "v=STSv1; id=20161109010200Z;"

If they had invalid certs, they wouldn't receive any mails from MTA-STS
supporting senders. I think someone would've noticed.

Some are slower, others are faster, but all of them should strive for
deprecation of man-in-the-middle-vulnerabilities by default.
