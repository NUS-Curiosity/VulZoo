Subject: CVEs issued by the Linux kernel CNA

As recently announced [1], kernel.org is now a CNA for the Linux kernel, and
today issued its first 8 CVEs, as seen in the archives of their mailing list
at https://lore.kernel.org/linux-cve-announce/ .

Their documentation [2] warns that we should expect a "seemingly large number
of CVEs that are issued by the Linux kernel team".

Since there's already an archived mailing list covering the CVE assignments,
I don't think it makes sense to mirror that large amount of traffic here, but
to only bring to oss-security those that are especially interesting or useful
to discuss further.  What do others think?
