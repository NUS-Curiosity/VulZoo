Sorry, I should have followed the instructions.

[aep@...-haswell tmp]$ while true; do n=$((RANDOM*64+RANDOM+1));
prlimit --as=$((n*4/2*3)) ./a.out $n; done

This results in a mix of these outputs:

PASSED
./a.out: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: failed to
map segment from shared object
Segmentation fault
