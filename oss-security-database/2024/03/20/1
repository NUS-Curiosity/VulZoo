Hi,

OpenWrt 23.05 uses kernel 5.15 and the ksmbd implementation found in 
this upstream kernel version. OpenWrt plans to do a new service release 
23.05.3 in the next days anyway with kernel 5.15.150. This should 
contain all needed fixes.

OpenWrt 22.03 uses ksmbd from https://github.com/cifsd-team/ksmbd in 
version 3.4.7. This is probably affected by these problems.
Maybe we will update this to 3.4.9 or backport the patches fixing 
security problems. OpenWrt 22.03 will be EoL in April 2024 anyway.
