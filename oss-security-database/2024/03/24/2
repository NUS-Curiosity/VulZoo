lists these changes:

> * Changes in Emacs 29.3
> Emacs 29.3 is an emergency bugfix release intended to fix several
> security vulnerabilities described below.
> 
> ** Arbitrary Lisp code is no longer evaluated as part of turning on Org mode.
> This is for security reasons, to avoid evaluating malicious Lisp code.
> 
> ** New buffer-local variable 'untrusted-content'.
> When this is non-nil, Lisp programs should treat buffer contents with
> extra caution.
> 
> ** Gnus now treats inline MIME contents as untrusted.
> To get back previous insecure behavior, 'untrusted-content' should be
> reset to nil in the buffer.
> 
> ** LaTeX preview is now by default disabled for email attachments.
> To get back previous insecure behavior, set the variable
> 'org--latex-preview-when-risky' to a non-nil value.
> 
> ** Org mode now considers contents of remote files to be untrusted.
> Remote files are recognized by calling 'file-remote-p'.
