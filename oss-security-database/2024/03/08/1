I also notice far more than I can send on myself, so tend to filter both
for those projects that are more likely to be distributed directly by
distros and more widely installed on systems, and for issues that seem
to have a higher level of impact.  So I'm not sending on notice of every
bug in every WordPress plugin, nor every npm module.

If people want to see different coverage here, speaking up can change that,
but helping out as described above will make an even bigger impact.
