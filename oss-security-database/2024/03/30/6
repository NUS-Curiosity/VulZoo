I think we are heading in this direction anyway, given that more and
more people are under reporting obligations for active exploitation.
Untangling who has to be notified when isn't really a good use of our
time.  I expect we'll have to tell reporters that if they tell us that
a vulnerabilty is under active exploitation, we'll have to go public
more or less immediately.
