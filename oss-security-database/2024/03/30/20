I'll let you in on a little secret, too: bad actors talk to each other! They
exchange information about the exploits. So you already *potentially have* 
10000 of them trying to exploit the vulnerability, with the most of the
affected people being none-the-wiser. 

I'd rather know, so I can do something to avoid or repair the damage, instead
of figuring out my systems might have been compromised for weeks. If you want
to sit in the dark - feel free, just don't take me with you.
