I don't think so - while it was extracted by Florian, not me, I just
re-extracted it from 5.6.0 and got the same result.

I think it may just be confusion from the script renaming files. The symbols
you mention come from the script compiling src/liblzma/check/crc64_fast.c
after making some small changes, to call into the added _get_cpuid().  Whereas
the attached file was the .o file that was, in very obfuscated form, committed
to the repository.

The script is quite sneaky, it

1) extracts ./liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o from the archive
2) copies .libs/liblzma_la-crc64_fast.o .libs/liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o (note
   the .libs)
3) compiles and links the modified crc64_fast.c file together with the
   extracted ./liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o, outputting to
   .libs/liblzma_la-crc64_fast.o, using -r
4) does 2) for the 32 bit version
5) compiles the modified crc32_fast.c, outputting to
   .libs/liblzma_la-crc32_fast.o
6) links the shared library
7) if compilation fails, it moves .libs/liblzma_la-crc{64,32}-fast.o back to
   their original name, I guess to removing "evidence" of the modified output
8) removes
   ./liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o,
   .libs/liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o,
   .libs/liblzma_la-crc32-fast.o


If you found crc64_generic etc in liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o, you must have used
the one from .libs/ somehow?


I'm attaching ./liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o for both 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. These are
the files extracted from the .xz file, and should not have symbols for
crc64_arch_optimized, crc64_resolve, crc64_generic but will have stuff like
_get_cpuid, .crc64_generia.

When the backdoor is not active .libs/liblzma_la-crc64_fast.o has only few
symbols, crc64_generic, crc64_arch_optimized, crc64_resolve.

Greetings,

Andres Freund
