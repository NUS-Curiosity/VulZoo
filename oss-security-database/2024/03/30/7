You can do two things at once, I suspect attackers can too :)

Sure - but why do you have to do that in private? You can get everyone
to help get those answers and converge on the correct solution
quickly.

The attackers already knew about this issue, so you were just keeping it
from defenders... that doesn't make sense to me.

If your organization was not on the list and got compromised during the

Yeah, my point is just this would have been better handled in public!

I respect your work and I'm glad you were working on this, but in public
we could have got more eyes on this!
