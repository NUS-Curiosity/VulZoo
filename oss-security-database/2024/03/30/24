Not necessarily. For example, I don't have access to embargoed Chrome 0-days 
before the updates come out, and a lot of other folks don't either. Should all 
Chrome 0-days be public before the updates are available? Are you advocating for 
this?

I'm not necessarily arguing for embargoes on backdoors, I'm saying that posting 
publicly about it before even knowing what it was would have resulted in a worse 
outcome. That's my opinion, you may think it's a wrong.

Perhaps the question here is why isn't your organization on one of the multitude 
of places where this issue was discussed in private for a few hours, and where 
it was decided that this should be public?

Marc.
