Hi Alex,

(I was not subscribed to oss-security and not CCed, so I only got your email
from the archive, not sure if I got the In-Reply-To etc right. Subscribed
now.)

If you are building your own xz you might not be affected, due to either the
debian/ directory needing to exist, or $RPM_ARCH needing to be
set. Furthermore, if you build from git, rather than the distributed tarballs,
the backdoor code won't be injected into the build, even if present in the
repository. Similar if you build with cmake, I think.

However, I personally would still downgrade, even if likely not affected due
to the above.

Greetings,
