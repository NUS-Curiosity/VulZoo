Sure, it's distros moderators job to determine if an embargo is
necessary :)

I guess I would hope you would trust the moderators to evaluate the
necessity of an embargo.

No, vulnerabilities usually require a patch, and we never know if bad
guys already know about the bug (unfortunately they won't tell us). You
could argue that if we release a patch, the attacker might respond by
trying to compromise as many targets as possible before their exploit is
worthless.

After all, if you're spending $1M to develop an exploit, why not keep an
eye on git commits to monitor if your investment is about to be ruined?

If someone said "it's better to let the attackers work slowly and
stealthily than alert them and potentially incentivize them to
compromise lots of people". I think most people would be strongly
opposed, I know I am!

I think this is not significanly different to Solars argument - If we
discuss this in public, maybe the attackers will start compromising
systems more aggressively.
