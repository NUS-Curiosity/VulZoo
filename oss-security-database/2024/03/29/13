Unfortunately xz 5.61 added further obfuscations, making it harder to
detect. Should have made it clearer that the attached .o was from 5.60. Among
others 5.61 removed the two symbols you're checking against here.  That's why
Vegard's script looks for a specific instructions sequence, but obviously is
also more obscure :/
