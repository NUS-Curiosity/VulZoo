Isn't that the purpose of the crlutil command in the nss package?
 From "man 1 crlutil" ...

DESCRIPTION
        The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Management Tool, crlutil, is a command-line utility that can list, generate, modify, or delete CRLs within the NSS security database file(s) and list, create,
        modify or delete certificates entries in a particular CRL.
