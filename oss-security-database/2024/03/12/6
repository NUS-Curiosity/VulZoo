I have no idea whether this idea has been discussed by distros or
implementors of said libraries. Perhaps someone directly involved can
weigh in on this.

But on the face of it, CRLite-on-the-server sounds like a pretty good
idea for users who are fine with getting only a yes/no revocation
result (as opposed to the reason code and other details present in the
full CRL) and trusting the CRLite aggregator. Getting direct and
easy-to-deploy support in popular TLS libraries would seem like a net
positive for TLS security; needing to bring in a separate library, at
least if it's a relatively weighty one like NSS, probably wouldn't get
a lot of traction.
