Subject: Public Review Period for CVE rules

Since discussions here occasionally touch on how CNA's assign CVE's,
those who are interested in the subject should be aware that updates
to those rules are currently posted for a public comment & review
period until next Wednesday, March 20.  For details see:

https://medium.com/@cve_program/public-review-period-for-cna-operational-rules-document-open-march-6-20-8415d6857bed

(For those who like to see such announcements directly from the CVE
  program, I saw this on https://mastodon.social/@CVE_Program and
  https://twitter.com/CVEannounce/ .)
