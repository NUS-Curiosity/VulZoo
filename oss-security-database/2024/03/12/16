A lot of traction via push by giants should, in my opinion, be
observed for DNSSEC and wonderful (imho) concepts like RFC 7250.

If i understood this right the new postfix 3.9 series, when used
with OpenSSL 3.2.0 and above, brings support for this TLS
mechanism of the future.

Unfortunately terms like "the future is now" have never been
anything else but hollow words (or points to the wrong direction).

I do not know which other TLS libraries support RFC 7250 either.
