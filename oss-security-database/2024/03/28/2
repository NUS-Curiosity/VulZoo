>/etc/default/devpts

This file is used by sysvinit when mounting /dev/pts.

systemd doesn't use it. It mounts /dev/pts with mode=620 by default.

>/etc/login.defs

As far as I can see, TTYPERM from login.defs is used only by login(1) 
and sometimes¹ by su(1). If you log in through SSH, or run xterm(1) or 
screen(1) or... it won't have any effect.

It's all awful and undocumented.
