Thanks.  What I am doing now is suggest _one_ initial task per person
off-list, with no overlap.  I'd appreciate a quicker response than "in a
day or 2" on whether you accept the task or not (and why not, in which
case I can then suggest a different task to you).  So far, I suggested
one task to Katherine and one other task to another volunteer who
contacted me off-list.  I'll e-mail Ian off-list with a third task now.
