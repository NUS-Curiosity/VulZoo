This does look minor indeed - not usable for large-scale attacks, and
libarchive is quite unique in that it even bothered to filter control
characters, whereas most command-line tools outputting filenames don't
bother.  My guess is it could have been an early experiment to see
whether the project would accept PRs degrading security.

That said, here's an excellent write-up by David Leadbeater on specific
ways that specific terminal emulators may be usefully attacked with
control sequences:

It's been mentioned in here before.  I just wish David would post a full
text version of it to oss-security in separate thread.
