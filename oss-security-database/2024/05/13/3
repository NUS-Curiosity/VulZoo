While he is definitely somewhat confused, he claims at the start to have 
detected a compromise, but does not give details about the indications 
that led him to that conclusion.

As far as I can tell from a quick perusal, (landing at 
<URL:https://microsoft.github.io/mu/dyn/mu_feature_dfci/DfciPkg/Docs/Scenarios/DfciScenarios/>) 
it seems that DFCI "Zero Touch" is actually tightly bound to Microsoft 
cloud services, and there is supposed to be a local option to remove the 
zero touch certificate (thus disabling it more-or-less permanently) if 
DFCI is not in use on the machine.  The example implies that the UEFI 
configuration tool ("BIOS setup") should provide this option.
