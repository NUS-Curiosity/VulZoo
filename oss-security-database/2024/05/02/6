This reads like an excuse to post lots of thoughts that are off-topic
for this thread.  I understand that sometimes discussions wander off the
original topic, but in this case the second half of your message is
totally irrelevant.  I approved this one message anyway out of respect
for the time you spent writing it, but please be aware that I am
unlikely to do that next time you do something like this.  I also ask
others to please refrain from following up on parts irrelevant to this
thread's original topic.  Another reason I post this reply publicly is
not to give the impression that it's OK to hijack threads here.
