                    Xen Security Advisory XSA-457
                              version 2

    Linux/xen-netfront: Memory leak due to missing cleanup function

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

* Clarify the XSA is in netfront and *not* netback
* Clarify the impact: only the guest may crash

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

In netfront, xennet_alloc_one_rx_buffer() failed to call the
appropriate clean-up function, resulting in a memory leak.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest userspace process can exhaust memory resources
within the guest kernel, potentially leading to a guest crash (Denial
of Service). It is not known whether it can be triggered remotely.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems with guests running Linux 5.9 and later with Xen PV network
devices are affected.

MITIGATION
==========

For HVM guests, using emulated network devices will avoid this issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following patch in Linux resolves the issue:

NOTE ON THE LACK OF EMBARGO
===========================

The issue was reported initially on a public bug tracker and fixed in
public before it was realized that there was a security aspect.
