Let's be including vulnerability information right in here, not only via
reference, so:

  * Fixed: [CVE-2024-34402]
      Protect against integer overflow in ComposeQueryEngine
      (GitHub #183, GitHub #185)
  * Fixed: [CVE-2024-34403]
      Protect against integer overflow in ComposeQueryMallocExMm
      (GitHub #183, GitHub #186)

Thanks,

Alexander
