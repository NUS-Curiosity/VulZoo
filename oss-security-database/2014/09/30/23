It’s not about making that secure. Suppose, for example, that your program here is one of those many that have helper shell scripts.   Find one that has a vector where you can insert things into an ancestor’s environment.   Find an interesting vulnerability in a deeply embedded shell script and …. profit.

You can argue  that those programs and shell scripts shouldn’t be vulnerable, but you have locks on your car doors even though you have an intruder alarm and an immobiliser.
