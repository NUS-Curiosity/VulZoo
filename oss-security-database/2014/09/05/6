It has been discovered that the extension "mm_forum" (mm_forum) is vulnerable to
Arbitrary Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting and Cross-Site Request Forgery.

Release Date: February 12, 2014
Affected Versions: Version 1.9.2 and below
Vulnerability Type: Arbitrary Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting and
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

Severity: Critical
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C

Problem Description: Failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input the
extension is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. It was possible to upload
arbitrary files as files were not checked against the file deny pattern, thus
Arbitrary Code Execution was possible by uploading PHP files. Additionally it
was possible to create posts on behalf of logged in users (CSRF).

Solution: An updated version 1.9.3 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager
and at http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/mm_forum/1.9.3/t3x/.
Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.

Credits: Credits go to Michael Knabe and Stano Paska who discovered and reported
the issue.
