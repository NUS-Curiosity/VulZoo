Subject: CVE-2014-3565, net-snmp: snmptrapd crash

Good morning,

CVE-2014-3565 was assigned to the following:

A remote denial-of-service flaw was found in the way snmptrapd handled
certain SNMP traps when started with the "-OQ" option. If an attacker
sent an SNMP trap containing a variable with a NULL type where an
integer variable type was expected, it would cause snmptrapd to crash.

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1125155

Upstream do not consider it a serious issue as very few people
use the "-OQ" option. It should be fixed in a new release due soon.
