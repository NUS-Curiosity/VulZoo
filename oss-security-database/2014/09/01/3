Hi Thijs,

FYI your email results in a BAD signature for me, presumably due to
line-wrapping issue.

Please note that this patch alone is not sufficient to fix the issue
as it brought usability issues fixed in later versions. Specifically
the first patch blocked retrieval of multiple keys at once, e.g during
a --refresh operation, and retrieval by subkey signing ID.

My personal opinion is this is expected behavior as the keyservers are
not trusted, and as you point out above, there are proper measures
that should be used that invalidate this as an attack vector, i.e. by
performing proper key verification.
