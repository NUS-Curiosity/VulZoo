The suffix fixes the obvious CGI hole, but it leaves exposed programs in which the adversary gets to choose the variable name as well.

env $'BASH_FUNC_foo%%=() { echo 123\n }' bash -c "foo"

I think that a more robust solution, such using a separate store for functions, is needed if function import is to survive as a feature.
