The discussion in Issue22187 is about changing code in Python 2.x to
work around this. However, is it useful to assign one new
CVE-2014-#### ID for Bash, on the expectation that Bash was intended
to recognize valid characters in zh_CN.GBK, but instead is identifying
part of a two-byte character as a \ character, and this has security
implications for products that attempt to do otherwise-correct quoting
of untrusted strings for use in sh commands?
