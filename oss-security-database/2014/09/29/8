HI Chet,

As you are aware, a sixth security issue has been discovered.

Due to the nature of the vulnerability, I believe that it's best to
break backward compatibility as done by FreeBSD and NetBSD until a
proper patch is developed. We are lucky to have security researchers
reporting their findings publicly. What about others that don't ?

I strongly believe that it's much safer to have it disabled, and have
a complete and comprehensive audit of the source code, and then
re-enable it.
