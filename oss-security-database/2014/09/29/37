This seems to me to be the good old CODE vs. DATA issue.

IMHO, ENV vars are supposed to always be DATA, never CODE.
If code is allowed, the parser might always fail. Judging by the recently
dug up dirt, it most certainly will.
Passing code as ENV is an ugly hack, probably born out of necessity arising
when trying to implicitly propagate code, because no alernatives are
apparent, are they?

If it's done at all, it should at least be explicit.

That's why I'm voting for having the *BSD approach in upstream: make the
parsing of ENV vars optional, default OFF.
