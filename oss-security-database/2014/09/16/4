Regardless of the "what happens to squid itself" answer, is it known
that the crash has a security impact? This message seemed to conclude
with an implied request for more information, e.g., "it looks like you
can," etc. An example of a security impact would be: the administrator
wanted pinger to be running, and a crash means that pinger
processes/threads are no longer available, and pinger is not
automatically restarted.

If there is a security impact, then the patch in Novell Bug 891268
would probably correspond to at least three CVE IDs, e.g.,

1. "used to index into a string array" possibly corresponds to
http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/129.html for the modified
default case after case 136, and approximately two other places in the
patch

2. added "if (n <= 0)" code possibly corresponds to
http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/389.html

3. added "if (preply.psize) < 0" code apparently corresponds to a more
general issue with missing data validation
