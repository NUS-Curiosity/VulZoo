Subject: [OSSA 2014-030] TLS cert verification option not honoured in paste
 configs (CVE-2014-7144)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-030
CVE: CVE-2014-7144
Date: September 25, 2014

Title: TLS cert verification option not honoured in paste configs
Reporter: Qin Zhao (IBM)
Products: keystonemiddleware, python-keystoneclient
Versions: versions up to 1.1.1 (keystonemiddleware),
          versions up to 0.10.1 (python-keystoneclient)

Description:
Qin Zhao from IBM reported a vulnerability in keystonemiddleware
(formerly shipped as python-keystoneclient). When the 'insecure' option
is set in a paste configuration file it is effectively ignored,
regardless of its value. As a result certificate verification will be
disabled, leaving TLS connections open to MITM attacks. All versions of
keystonemiddleware with TLS settings configured via a paste.ini file are
affected by this flaw.

keystonemiddleware fix:

python-keystoneclient fix:
https://review.openstack.org/112232

Notes:
These fixes are included in the keystonemiddleware 1.2.0 release
and in the python-keystoneclient 0.11.0 release.
