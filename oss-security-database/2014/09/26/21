Subject: CVE request: zeromq

Hi,

I've taken over CVE handling for zeromq. There were two issues fixed
recently. Could you please assign a CVE to them?

Matthew Hawn found that libzmq (ZeroMQ/C++) did not validate the other
party's security handshake properly, allowing a man-in-the-middle
downgrade attack. 
Code commit: https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/1190

Matthew Hawn found that libzmq (ZeroMQ/C++) did not implement a
uniqueness check on connection nonces, and the CurveZMQ RFC was
ambiguous about nonce validation. This allowed replay attacks.
Code commit: https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/1191

Only ZMQ versions 4.0.x with x < 5 are affected. 4.0.5 is about to be released.

Thanks,

Roland
