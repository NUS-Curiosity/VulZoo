While I can reproduce the other example and get a segfault, I don't see
anything with this. Is there a typo in it? (tried some variants to
correct, but nothing leads to anything interesting)
I just get a syntax error:

$ (for x in {1..200} ; do echo "for x$x in ; do :"; done; for x in
{1..200} ; do echo done ; done) > test-script.sh $ bash test-script.sh
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `$'
