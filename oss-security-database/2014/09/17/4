Hello all,

The twisted security project has identified, fixed, and released a
release fixing a security issue, I would like a CVE assigned:

Title: trustRoot not respected in HTTP client
Reporter: Alex Gaynor and David Reid (Rackspace)
Products: Twisted (14.0 only).
Description:
When specifying the trustRoot (CA store) for the HTTP client, Twisted
did not respect the user's specification, and always used the default
of the platform trust. This means that users attempting to use this
feature to implement certificate pinning, or otherwise restrict the
trust CAs would still have accepted any certificate signed by a CA.

Twisted 14.0.1 has been issued to resolve this issue; (Distributors
should note that this release has failing tests, and that a 14.0.2
release will be issued tomorrow, this does not effect the fix, only
the tests).

Alex
