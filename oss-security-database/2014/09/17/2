Subject: CVE request: [CIFS] Possible null ptr deref in SMB2_tcon

Hi,

Commit 18f39e7b[1] of the linux kernel repository fixes a remote null
pointer dereference on the client when it resolves DFS referrals but
the server deletes the IPC$ share. The commit has already been merged
for the 3.16, 3.14, and 3.10 branches.

Could a CVE id be assigned please?

Thanks in advance.
