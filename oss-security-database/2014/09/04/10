Subject: Re: CVE request: V8 Memory Corruption and Stack Overflow - Node.js

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

http://blog.nodejs.org/2014/07/31/v8-memory-corruption-stack-overflow/
is CVE-2014-5256. This CVE ID has been in public use for about two
weeks (examples are the http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/95057 and
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21682094 references)
but unfortunately the CVE ID isn't mentioned in any obvious place on
the nodejs.org web site, possibly because we only thought it was
likely that upstream would do that, and we didn't directly ask.

Also, the specific wording "A memory corruption vulnerability, which
results in a denial-of-service, was identified in the versions of V8"
was discussed with upstream. The information that we have is that the
issue actually should not be considered a vulnerability in V8, and
instead should be considered a vulnerability in Node.js. It is not a
case where a CVE assignment by Google would have been expected.
