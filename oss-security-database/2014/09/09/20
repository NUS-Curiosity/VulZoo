Actually one reason I picked PyPI is simply because it has
popularity/usage info, each package web page says how many times it was
downloaded in the last day/week/month, so I picked a quick an easy audit
of packages downloaded more than 5000 times in the last month.

Also this is to maybe help raise awareness of security a bit, things
like tmp issues

1) shouldn't exist, especially in Python, mkstemp! mkdtemp! no need to
reinvent attempts to create files securely, or to do it totally insecurely.

2) vendors should fix tmp, luckily this is happening, our PaaS OpenShift
Enterprise, and the service OpenShift Online both use poly instantiated
/tmp for each user cartridge (a cartridge is essentially on or more
services/applications like PHP, MySQL, etc. being used to run something
like say Wordpress). So the exploitation of tmp vulns on OpenShift would
generally require additional vulnerabilities in order to get file system
access (at which point a tmp vuln is likely not that interesting to an
attacker, especially in the case of OpenShift and the way cartridges are
restricted).

Yup. Also this is a way to unwind, I know a lot of people that play
computer card games like solitaire to wind down, looking at tmp vulns is
essentially the same pleasantly monotonous experience, at least for me =).

Also a reminder:

https://kurt.seifried.org/2012/03/14/creating-temporary-files-securely/

has a specific list of the correct ways to do it, if I'm missing a
language let me know and I'll add it.
