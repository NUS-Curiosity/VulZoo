        Save the recorded times, OR dump them into /tmp if the file
        open fails.

        try:

int(time.time) is easily guessed, create a few thousand and you're
covered for the next few hours and can stop anyone from using stopwatch,
or you can just blow away files as usual =).

            fp = open(filename, 'w')
            log.warning('WARNING: stopwatch cannot write to "%s"' %
(self.stopwatch_file))
            log.warning('WARNING: stopwatch is using "%s" to save times'
% (filename,))

        dump(self.times, fp)
        fp.close()
