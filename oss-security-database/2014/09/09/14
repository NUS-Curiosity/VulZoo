I would say that the major impact for test automation tool for using a
fixed location for some file is that there can't be more then one
instance of that tool running on the same machine. Which is an issue
when you try to scale your testing.

Test automation on the other hand IMHO requires that we are working in
a secure sand box. If there is a malicious user on the same machine
then I bet things have already gone very wrong somewhere else.
