  Because although the chances of them being exploited are low they
 are genuine issues which have security implications.

  There is copious documentation online about how file races are
 bad, including this quick reference:

    https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/FIO21-C.+Do+not+create+temporary+files+in+shared+directories

  PyPi?  've no idea why that was chosen, but I expect because it
 is a large mass of code that has had little similar attention paid
 to it in the past.  node.js will probably be next, I'm sure lots of
 modules exist created by inexperienced developers who haven't
 considered the implications of posting new code libraries.

  I did something similar looking for /tmp abuses in Debian
 packages, via a very very automated scan:

  Finding these issues was distressingly easy, and although in the
 real world the chances of significant impact are minimal they were
 genuine issues that should be reported and fixed.
