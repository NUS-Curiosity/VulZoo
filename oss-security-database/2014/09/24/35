I also see gnutls posted a new release some days, with this entry without CVE

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/7663
"** libgnutls: Fixed issue with certificates being sanitized by gnutls prior
to signature verification. That resulted to certain non-DER compliant modifications
of valid certificates, being corrected by libtasn1's parser and restructured as
the original. Issue found and reported by Antti Karjalainen and Matti Kamunen from
Codenomicon."

which smells similar.

Ciao, Marcus
