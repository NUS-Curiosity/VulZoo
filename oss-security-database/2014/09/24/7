Subject: CVE request: multiple issues in libupnp

libupnp (aka Portable UPnP SDK) has received some security fixes
involving string handling and additionally some fixes for bugs created
by a previous botched attempt to fix insecure string handling.
The previous fixes actually broke UPnP clients using libupnp (most notably VideoLan's VLC).

The commits [0398b1] [814d15] are specifically security related.

Can CVE(s) be assigned to these?

Thanks.
