Subject: nss RSA forgery (CVE-2014-1568)

One serious vuln per day isn't enough, so nss decided to bring us
another one.

Mozilla reports this:
https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-73.html
Bugtracker entry still private, so hard to judge about details.
Interesting: Two independent discoveries (we had the same with
heartbleed and I couldn't believe this was coincidence).

This is what mcaffee has to say:

They say its related to BER/ASN1-parsing, but adam langley disagrees:

And it seems cyassl had something similar, also found by intel:

No real details yet and information seems confusing.
