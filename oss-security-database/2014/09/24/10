Subject: CVE-2014-6271: remote code execution through bash

Stephane Chazelas discovered a vulnerability in bash, related to how
environment variables are processed: trailing code in function
definitions was executed, independent of the variable name.

In many common configurations, this vulnerability is exploitable over
the network.

Chet Ramey, the GNU bash upstream maintainer, will soon release
official upstream patches.
