Is CPU actually going to include the information Sven asked for?  Such
information was on included in past CPUs - they only mention the last
affected version in supported branch.  So in case of this flaw, it's
most likely only going to say:

  Supported Versions Affected: 5.5.38 and earlier, 5.6.19 and earlier

That will not answer the original question, or provide more information
than what's already available.

I mean it's reasonable to admit the info about the first affected
version is not readily available and won't be looked for, just noting
that CPU is very unlikely to provide that information.
