Subject: OpenFiler - Arbitrary Code Execution & Stored XSS

hi,

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the latest version of OpenFiler
appliance, 2.99.1 as reported
here<https://forums.openfiler.com/index.php?/topic/6720-arbitrary-code-execution-stored-xss-vulnerability-in-openfiler-latest-version-2991/>,
here <http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33247> and
here<http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33248>
OpenFiler is a FreeNAS appliance equivalent.


- Vulnerability 1
OpenFiler is vulnerable to an arbitrary code execution attack by not
validating the hostname input, this vulnerability allows an attacker to
execute any system shell command with the root user privileges.

- Proof of concept:
i.  Login with any available user
ii. Change the hostname value to `cat /etc/passwd`
iii. Submit

* Refreshing the screen / Reloading the page results with passwd content in
the OpenFiler system hostname value.

- Vulnerability 2
Multiple Stored XSS were found in OpenFiler, by creating a volume group or
a network access configuration with malicious code e.g.
<script>alert("css")</script> any user attempt to create, view or modify
volume shares executes the attack.
