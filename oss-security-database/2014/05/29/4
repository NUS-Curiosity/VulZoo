Can you clarify the scope of this CVE?

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1097008 says:

  CVE-2014-0234 OpenShift Enterprise openshift-origin-broker: default password creation

  The OpenShift Enterprise openshift-origin-broker configures a default password:

  /etc/openshift/broker.conf:MONGO_PASSWORD="mooo"
  /etc/openshift/broker.conf:MONGO_PASSWORD="mongopass"

  Please note that the optional installer also did this previously:

  https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/enterprise-2.0/enterprise/install-scripts/generic/openshift.sh


For the openshift.sh script, we think you might mean something like
(this isn't really the right branch):

  https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/commit/4339020c62e43fa16f2145d46636f7dc0e26327f

in which, possibly, the scope of the CVE is both:

   enterprise/install-scripts/generic/openshift.sh

and

   enterprise/install-scripts/openshift.ks

but not

    enterprise/install-scripts/amazon/openshift-amz.sh

which has a different type of issue?

Possibly a more important question is the status of
MONGO_PASSWORD="mooo" - there's no "mooo" anywhere in
4339020c62e43fa16f2145d46636f7dc0e26327f. Instead, "mooo" apparently
comes from:

  https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/broker/conf/broker.conf

and is not yet fixed in that github.com copy of the code.

So, we could potentially model this as:

  1. "different affected versions" in the sense that if someone wasn't
     using Red Hat's RPMs and instead updated everything from
     github.com after seeing RHSA-2014:0487-1, they would have the
     4339020c62e43fa16f2145d46636f7dc0e26327f patches but would still
     have "mooo"

or

  2. "different affected products" in the sense that "mooo" is a
     vulnerability affecting the OpenShift Enterprise product (or
     specifically the openshift/origin-server package), whereas
     4339020c62e43fa16f2145d46636f7dc0e26327f is a non-identical
     vulnerability in the openshift/openshift-extras package

In other words, we don't know the interpretation in which "mooo" and
4339020c62e43fa16f2145d46636f7dc0e26327f end up with the same CVE ID.

(We didn't try to determine why your quoted broker.conf has two
MONGO_PASSWORD= lines, but
https://github.com/openshift/origin-server/blob/master/broker/conf/broker.conf
has only one MONGO_PASSWORD= line.)

The pre-4339020c62e43fa16f2145d46636f7dc0e26327f unpatched code such as
https://github.com/openshift/openshift-extras/blob/9ecba01d34d7231cc05f04710217ddcee53202ad/enterprise/install-scripts/generic/openshift.sh
contained this comment:

  # While this script serves as a good example script for installing a
  # single host, it is not comprehensive nor robust enough to be considered
  # a proper enterprise installer on its own. Production installations will
  # typically require significant adaptations or an entirely different
  # method of installation. Please adapt it to your needs.

Typically, if a piece of code is simply not intended to be used as-is,
it can't have CVE assignments for its vulnerabilities. The situation
would be different if (for example) any Linux distribution shipped
openshift.sh with conflicting documentation, or executed openshift.sh
automatically.

This might mean that the best scope of CVE-2014-0234 is only the
default broker.conf file (because that issue is known to actually
affect the Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2 product).
