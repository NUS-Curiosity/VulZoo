So /etc/fstab is world readable, within that system. The file is then
being exported to Red Hat, we don't really need or want the password,
we also make an effort to sanitize the data sent, so if nothing else
this falls into the "intended/advertised security feature that failed"
and would qualify for a CVE as such as I understand things.
