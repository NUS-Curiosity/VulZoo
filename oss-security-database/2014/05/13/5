Subject: CVE-2014-0223 Qemu: qcow1: Validate image size

    Hello,

'CVE-2014-0223' has been assigned to this issue.

A huge image size could cause s->l1_size to overflow. Make sure that
images never require a L1 table larger than what fits in s->l1_size.

This cannot only cause unbounded allocations, but also the allocation of
a too small L1 table, resulting in out-of-bounds array accesses (both
reads and writes).

Upstream fix:

Thank you.
