Subject: CVE request: dovecot denial of service

Hi,

we were made aware of a recently fixed DoS vulnerability in Dovecot,
which doesn't seem to have a CVE id assigned:

http://dovecot.org/list/dovecot-news/2014-May/000273.html

states:

* Fixed a DoS attack against imap/pop3-login processes. If SSL/TLS
  handshake was started but wasn't finished, the login process
  attempted to eventually forcibly disconnect the client, but failed
  to do it correctly. This could have left the connections hanging
  arond for a long time. (Affected Dovecot v1.1+)

Could a CVE be assigned for this vulnerability?

Thanks,
