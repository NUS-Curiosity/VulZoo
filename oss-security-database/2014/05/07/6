I don't know how others feel about this, but I'd be more careful with
such cases.

Basically this sounds to me like a "we don't know if it is a
vulnerability, but it could be". And there I'd say "in doubt be on the
safe side".

Rate them as "very low impact", don't treat them with any urgency, but
I think such issues should be fixed and should be called
vulnerabilities nevertheless.
