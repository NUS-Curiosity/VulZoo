Subject: A note on DBus and the Hash DOS

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

So many years ago some hash dos stuff happened. I checked into a
variety of programs using embedded copies of various things like
XML/etc. Also other programs that use hashing for stuff, one of which
is DBus.

The bad news: DBus has a vulnerable hash implementation

The good news: there doesn't appear to be many (any?) ways to inject
data easily to trigger this vulnerability.

So I don't think this needs a CVE since it isn't really trigger-able,
but posted this more as a reminder that hash DoS vulns are probably
still lurking in various places.

With thanks to Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team who
did the actual code audit bits.
