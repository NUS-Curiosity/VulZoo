Subject: CVE request Linux kernel: filter: prevent nla extensions to peek
 beyond the end of the message

    Hello,

Linux kenrel built with the BPF interpreter support in the networking core is 
vulnerable to an out of bounds buffer access flaw. It occurs when accessing a 
netlink attribute from the skb->data buffer.

An unprivileged user/program could use this flaw to crash the system kernel 
resulting in DoS.
