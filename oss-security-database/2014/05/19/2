Can you provide more information about how these issues cross
privilege boundaries?

There does not seem to be much documentation available on the
openfiler.com web site, at least not under the
http://openfiler.com/learn page.
http://www.openfiler.com/learn/how-to/graphical-installation says "You
can learn how to manage the Openfiler system by browsing the
administrator guide online which can be found here" and this is a link
to the http://www.openfiler.com/docs/manual/ URL, which yields a "Page
not found" error.

https://forums.openfiler.com/index.php?/topic/3190-manual/ (possibly
out-of-date) says "The official manual is not free."

As far as we can tell from the graphical-installation page, Openfiler
is a Linux distribution, and all of the Linux accounts (including
root) are under the control of an application-level account named
openfiler. The attacks seem to require access to this account or
possibly an equivalent account. Although the ability to use `
characters for shell commands is arguably a bug, an attacker with
access to the openfiler account can apparently change the root
password and other passwords, and then login directly to execute any
commands as root.

For example (again, possibly out-of-date):
  https://forums.openfiler.com/index.php?/topic/3661-root-account-is-locked-down/

  As far as the GUI is concerned, the 'root' account is just a normal
  user. You need to log in as 'openfiler' to administer the system.

Maybe there's an argument that one only needs network connectivity to
TCP port 446 for the administrative web interface, but one needs
connectivity to TCP port 22 (maybe?) to login as root.

Also, http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33248/ seems to be about XSS
attacks conducted by the openfiler account against the openfiler
account.

The issues can have CVE IDs only if there's privilege escalation in a
realistic way.
