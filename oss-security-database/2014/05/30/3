Use CVE-2014-3925 for this vulnerability in (only) Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5. The points we considered from our perspective (not
necessarily in order of importance) are:

 - deciding whether an issue is within, or outside, the scope of CVE
   can depend on practices of other vendors, not the change process
   that is used by a specific vendor

   Related to this, Red Hat could decide to not recognize the CVD ID
   within its change process, A few years ago, Red Hat had been doing
   this through the NVD Vendor Comments mechanism, for example: see
   "Official Statement from Red Hat" under
   http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-1130 and
   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=577578


 - from the perspective of an arbitrary end user, the
   https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/3592 document doesn't
   really seem to imply that the sosreport data would commonly need to
   be reviewed, because there is no discussion of potentially
   sensitive information

 - the "No space left on device" discussion seems to imply that
   there's a big file in some cases, and people might reasonably
   decline to review a big file unless told to do so

 - on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (only), nobody is telling them to do
   so

 - although it's completely true that "An 'attacker' can only benefit
   from the information if an authorized user makes it available to
   them," making it available is the common and intended purpose of
   using the sosreport feature

 - it's reasonable for an organization to have an internal security
   policy that no password may be sent to the Technical Support
   branch of any vendor

 - in a typical large enterprise, there may be dozens of software
   products that have "prepare/send debugging information to Technical
   Support" features, and often (because of the nature of other
   software products), there is no possibility of sending a password

 - thus, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (only), the potential presence
   of a password, coupled with the lack of warning, seems to sometimes
   violate reasonable expectations, and some end users would probably
   make use of a CVE ID to track this
