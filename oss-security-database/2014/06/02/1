Hello.

I believe you're right about CVE-2014-3465 not being applicable in
GnuTLS 2.x because in that branch the result of
gnutls_x509_oid2ldap_string is checked for NULL returns.

As for the rest, I've backported the fixes to GnuTLS 2.12.23 (the
CVE-2014-3467,3468,3469 fixes apply to the embedded libtasn1).

You're welcome to them:
