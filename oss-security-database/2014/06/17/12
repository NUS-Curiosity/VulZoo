My concern was more about things that are outside your control and can
still cause set*id calls to fail even if you feed them with sane data.
Some of these include other errors that can be encountered inside
syscall (e.g. memory allocation issues), capability issues, or simply
having MAC system (think SELinux) policy denying id change.  Those were
mentioned here:

Of course, while none of these are known to offer such easily and widely
usable attack vector as RLIMIT_NPROC causing setuid failure, it seems
reasonable to fix all properly while at it.
