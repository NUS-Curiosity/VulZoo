Sure. Send me instructions and I'm happy to help. I'm helping in Debian teams as
non Debian Developer status (I do not see embargoed issues) mainly committing to
security tracker[1][2] and in forensics team[3]. My current employer has nothing
to do with distro maintanance or similar activities (we only submit and patch
issues publicly in case it affects our projects). I usually follow oss-security
closely in my spare time so that I can submit bugs to Debian issue tracker[4].
