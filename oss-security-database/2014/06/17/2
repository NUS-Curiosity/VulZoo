Looking at the patch, mod_wsgi was previously expecting that setuid may
return error, it only failed to respond to the failure correctly.  It
only logged information about the failure, and continued to run with
unexpected privileges.

Few lines above the patched code, the same pattern is used for setgid
and setgroups / initgroups calls.  Is there a reason to not patch those
in the same way?  While there may be no such easy way to trigger failure
for those, their failure would also lead to user code running with
unexpected privileges.
