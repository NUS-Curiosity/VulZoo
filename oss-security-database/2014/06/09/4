Sorry, how is this really relevant?  setExpandEntityReferences(false)
does not prevent expansion of general entities, so I'm not sure why
expansion of parameter entities is the problem.

It continues to mention setExpandEntityReferences, hinting that should
be expected to provide security protections (text seems to imply
external entities are not expanded in documents, but they are still
defined and remote URLs fetched).  As previously mentioned, the setting
only changes DOM tree layout, and does not disable entity expansion.

E.g. parsing the following two inputs (one using internal other
external general entity):

$ cat test1.xml 
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE bleh [
<!ENTITY bar "BAR">
]>
<root>foo &bar; baz</root>

$ cat test2.xml 
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE bleh [
<!ENTITY bar SYSTEM "test2-bar.txt">
]>
<root>foo &bar; baz</root>

$ cat test2-bar.txt 
BAR

Setting setExpandEntityReferences to false changes the tree from:

- (Element) <root>
  - (Text) foo BAR baz

to:

- (Element) <root>
  - (Text) foo 
  - (Entity Reference) &bar;
  - (Text) BAR baz

&bar; is expanded to BAR either way.
