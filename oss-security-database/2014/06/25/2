Subject: CVE request: timthumb remote code execution

The timthumb code, used by a countless number of wordpress themes, has
(again) a remote code execution vulnerability:
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/117

All details there.

This affects the very latest upstream version 2.8.13, I just opened an
upstream bug:
https://code.google.com/p/timthumb/issues/detail?id=485&thanks=485&ts=1403690188

No fix available at the moment.
