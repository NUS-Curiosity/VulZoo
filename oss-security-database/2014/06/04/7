Speaking as an X.Org developer, I can attest that VMWare maintains the
xf86-video-vmware and xf86-input-vmmouse drivers in X.Org for use in
VMWare guests, and contributes very heavily to the development of Mesa3D
through a number of VMWare employees, including the primary maintainer.

Though that speaks to being a member of the OSS community in general,
and in producing software for which announcements might go to distros,
not necessarily for being on the receiving end.
