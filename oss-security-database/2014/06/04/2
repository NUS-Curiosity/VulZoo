FreeBSD had reported this OpenPAM issue to the distros list because of
more likely than average relevance to other distros, and the FreeBSD
advisory is posted to oss-security for the same reason as well as to
meet distros list policy.

I mention this so that people are not confused why this one advisory is
posted in here, even though we had decided that vendor-specific
advisories are normally not to be posted to oss-security.  There's no
change in that preference, but there may be exceptions to it like this
time (for good reasons).
