Thanks for the reply. I did read your earlier message. To answer your
question: I only apply patches that are absolutely necessary to fix a
known problem. Want to make sure the changed stuff doesn't lead to a
regression somewhere else. Futex stuff is a central component in the
kernel ... I can't judge about any possible side effects from reading
the code ... and this kernel is going on a number of production 
clusters.

Anyway, I've applied all the (2+4) patches to our 3.12. 
"futex: Make lookup_pi_state more robust" needed slight adjustment, but
nothing serious. I'll go and test now. If someone wants the patch set,
let me know. Then I can post it to the list.

Roland
