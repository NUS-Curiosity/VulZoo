Use CVE-2014-3981 for this issue in PHP.

We probably can't make a CVE assignment for this because the primary
affected product is unknown, and this /tmp/ffiYFc1nZ observation might
already be covered by a previous CVE. Lynis apparently runs many other
scripts and programs; for example, there are hundreds of

  FIND=`

lines.

We can make a CVE assignment corresponding to your disclosure of this
lynis.$$ issue on oss-security. Use CVE-2014-3982. A CVE for this most
likely won't (or shouldn't) have a
http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/21 reference unless the
original fulldisclosure author confirms the association.
