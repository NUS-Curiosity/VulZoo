Yes, this is what
"Versions:       kdelibs 4.10.95 to 4.13.2"
means.

The file usernotificationhandler.cpp was introduced in 4.10.95
(for the fix for bug 154100 and 265228)

Before that, SlaveInterface handled the messagebox request itself, with no 
need for a job pointer.

No idea where they got that from.... I cannot confirm this.
