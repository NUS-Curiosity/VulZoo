  It's been discussed in the other thread, yet just for the record, a reply 
from the upstream author:

|Hi Prasad

|Nope, latest lz4 release is not affected.
|

|Moreover, even the linux kernel implementation is safe, for now. To trigger 
|the risk, the program calling the lz4 linux kernel implementation must feed 
|the decoder with blocks of more than 8 MB. None of them is doing that right 
|now, so it's not exploitable.
|
|However, it's true that, in the future, maybe one program may wander into  
|this area. So it's a good thing to update the LZ4 implementation today, 
|before the risk get potentially exposed by a yet unknown future program.
|
|
|I feel this version of the story should be more widely answered. The current  
|risk has been overblown. If you have some way to answer to the sec-list 
|article you linked to, could you please make it known ? In the meantime, I'm 
|in contact with Greg k-h, to make sure the linux kernel implementation will 
|get fixed for the next Linux release.
|
|Best regards
|

Thank you.
