Wait.  You're saying that not having a firewall enabled by default qualifies for a CVE?  I mean, firewalls are pretty common sense and should definitely be used/available/whatever but to say that an operating system or device doesn't have a firewall enabled by default should have a CVE assigned seems... excessive, doesn't it?

How is not having a firewall enabled by default a _vulnerability_?  If we look at it this way, it's a good thing CVEs go past 9999 per year because we need to change everything we used to call "hardening" to be a vulnerability, do we not?
