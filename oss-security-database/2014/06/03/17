Yeah, you gotta love FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING.  It's just like
calling a website "secure" because it uses SSL.

I agree that these features don't purport to turn off certain
dangerous features, but to a developer who doesn't know what parameter
entities are, they could very easily assume they are safe with
setExpandEntityReferences(false).

Feel free to use this as a reference for other thoughts on what
developers should be wary of:

I would also be interested to hear if you think anything I mention in
there is inaccurate.
