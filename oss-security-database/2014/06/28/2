Then shouldn't be the same be true of the HttpOnly flag?  That line of thought is pretty much what I think in regards to that flag.

I don't know if you missed my comment in an earlier message, so I'll note it below because I think this is the real point:

"Kurt's argument about everything having an XSS makes it sound like, and the reasoning provided here as well, that we should no longer consider XSS a security flaw, but the absence of HttpOnly the security flaw.  I mean, if setting this flag "fixes" all XSS issues, then we should no longer be assigning CVEs to XSS issues, only to web servers/services that do not set HttpOnly or browsers that do not respect/handle it properly.  They can't _both_ get CVEs or be considered flaws, can they?"
