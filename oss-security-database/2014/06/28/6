Thanks for the investigation. Is there a reason not to link with lzo
instead of embedding it?

Good point, my searches indeed usually don't include any non-C
implementation, which might or might not be affected.

Thanks, so that's three reasons syslinux itself is not affected:

- embedded LZO didn't contain the affected code;
- syslinux core LZO assembly implementation is not touched;
- LZO is done only on controlled data (not under anyone control?)
