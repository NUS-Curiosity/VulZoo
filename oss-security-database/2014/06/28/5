Actually my point was more that back in the day cookie theft was
relatively rare, now it is pretty common thanks largely to XSS:

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=xss

so in my opinion we should assume most web based apps have XSS vulns
(I think that's a safe assumption =), as such then the use of HTTPOnly
on cookies becomes a virtual necessity to protect cookies as opposed
to a "nice to have hardening feature". In other words the security bar
should be moved (at least that's my opinion).
