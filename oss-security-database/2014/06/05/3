This would depend on how you installed it, e.g. as an upgrade?a new
install? If new then manually? from the script? In this case it was
that specific install script which was also documented as a possible
install method, thus I felt it deserved a CVE.



Correct, however in this case we document it as an install method, so
I felt it deserved a CVE, had it not been documented/mentioned I would
have not assigned a CVE at all since it would have been "example code"
for lack of a better term.
