Subject: [CVE request] Local privilege escalation in libfep

It was discovered that libfep uses UNIX domain sockets in the abstract 
namespace in an insecure way.  As a result, unprivileged local users 
were able to inject commands into running fep sessions of other users.

The upstream fix simply removes abstract namespace support, using a 
restricted directory to host the UNIX domain socket instead:

https://github.com/ueno/libfep/commit/293d9d3f

Abstract namespace support was introduced in this commit:

https://github.com/ueno/libfep/commit/5a170323

This means that versions from 0.0.5 to 0.0.9 (inclusive) are vulnerable, 
and 0.1.0 has the fix.
