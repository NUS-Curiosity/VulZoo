I couldn't agree more.

By fixing in advance, I mean to have the fixes/updates ready by the time the vulnerability is publicly disclosed. (However, in the case of cloud services, we may not have how to know if the fix was, in fact, applied/made in advance.)

NTP, OpenSSL, glibc, the Linux device drivers and kernel modules listed at https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere_hypervisor_esxi/5_5#open_source to name a few.
