Subject: CVE request: PHP configure script and Lynis tool /tmp/ issues reported
 on full disclosure

Good morning,

http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/21 reports two temporary 
file issues.

The first is in PHP's configure script:

char *filename = "/tmp/phpglibccheck";

(Red Hat bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1104978)

The second issue is Lynis writing a predictable file to /tmp/. Looking 
at the source I cannot tell which file that is, but 2 runs on Fedora 20 
revealed the following file being used each time:

/tmp/ffiYFc1nZ

I cannot find that in the source. I do not know if lynsis exec()'s any 
other scripts or programs. The full disclosure report might be referring 
to the following in include/tests_webservers:

  39     if [ "${OS}" = "AIX" ]; then
  40         TMPFILE=/tmp/lynis.$$

Thanks,
