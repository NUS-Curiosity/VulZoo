Adam must have prepared (but not published) this blog post in advance,
which is fine. :-)

The distros list was informed of the upcoming OpenSSL release a few days
in advance, but detail on the vulnerabilities was being provided
separately, on request from each specific distro individually (PGP
encrypted).  Overall, I'd say the advance notification to distros was
just right - not too much (only a few days), not too little (just
enough), and without unnecessarily exposing the detail to distros who
wouldn't need it.

A bit worrying is the statement that the "issue was reported to OpenSSL
on 1st May 2014", though, but I appreciate the OpenSSL team making that
statement (it's in the advisory).
