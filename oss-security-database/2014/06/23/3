Subject: CVE request: Piwigo before 2.6.2 ws.php Arbitrary User Creation CSRF

This CSRF vulnerability in Piwigo also does not have CVE yet. Fixed in 2.6.2
version.

Piwigo contains a flaw as HTTP requests to ws.php do not require multiple steps,
explicit confirmation, or a unique token when performing certain sensitive
actions. By tricking a user into following a specially crafted link, a
context-dependent attacker can perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF /
XSRF) attack causing the victim to create arbitrary users.
