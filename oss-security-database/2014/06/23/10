Subject: Ansible CVE requests

Hi,

it seems ansible 1.5.5 was released with a few security fix, but none
seems to have received a CVE 

http://lwn.net/Articles/603205/

I am not sure if they deserve one, but in doubt, if people could take a
look.
The mageia bug reference 3 commits in totally unrelated part of the
code.
