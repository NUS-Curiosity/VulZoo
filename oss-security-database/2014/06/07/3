We have heard from the original fulldisclosure author, and have
permission to continue with the public CVE assignments here. The new
status is that CVE-2014-3982 refers only to the above unsafe use of
/tmp/lynis.$$ on AIX. It's quite possible that Linux distributions
won't produce any security updates mapping to CVE-2014-3982.

A second CVE ID, CVE-2014-3986, refers to this separate vulnerability
on non-AIX platforms (i.e., any uname except for AIX):

  TMPFILE=`mktemp /tmp/lynis.XXXXXX`
  ...
  find ${I} -name "*.conf" -print >> ${TMPFILE}.unsorted

This apparently allows a straightforward symlink attack against the
${TMPFILE}.unsorted file. Credit for this discovery belongs to the
same author as in the http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/21
post.

(There are two CVE IDs because the provenance of the first full public
disclosure is not the same, and because the scope of CVE-2014-3982 had
already been defined.)
