It is closest to b. It would be very rare to assign a CVE for a design
choice by a system integrator. Suppose a new operating-system
distribution ships tomorrow without a virus scanner. Often the best
model for this would be a set of tasks that hasn't happened. For
example, the vendor hasn't yet investigated customer requirements for
what a virus scanner should do. The vendor hasn't performed the
release-engineering work of packaging a virus scanner. There are other
tasks as well. We don't think that CVE consumers are looking for us to
tag cases where a product lacks complete subsystem parity with all
possible competitors.
