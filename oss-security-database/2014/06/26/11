You need a separate vulnerability to access the cookie.  These 
vulnerabilities will have to be addressed even if the HttpOnly flag is 
set because indirectly, they usually give attackers access to 
information from which cookies are derived (e.g., by injecting a 
malicious login form).  Therefore, I think the HttpOnly flag is just 
hardening, and it's not even a very effective form of it.
