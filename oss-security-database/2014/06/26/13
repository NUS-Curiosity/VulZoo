Your answers are fair, but I don't (personally) see how something being "easy" to implement makes the absence of it a flaw.  I mean, HttpOnly is a mechanism to prevent a flaw (in something else) from being exploitable.  That by its very definition is something like SELinux, or a firewall, etc.  The presence or absence of HttpOnly doesn't create the flaw, the faulty software does.  I mean, the flaw is still there, and would still need to be fixed, HttpOnly is a bandaid.  A very useful one, as bandaids often are, but it's still a bandaid.  It doesn't fix a flaw, nor does its absence create one.

"Implementation error" sounds, to me, like a bug.  Not a flaw.  The criteria set out doesn't really seem to define whether something is a flaw, but rather the business case for whether or not to call it one (is it too expensive to implement, is it worth it, does it make life more difficult for people, etc.).  Maybe I'm wrong or naive, but I wasn't under the impression that business-based use-cases (such as development cost/effort) had any impact on whether or not something is a security flaw -- I mean, it either is or it isn't.

Anyways, I was largely thinking out loud here to see what others thought about this as well.  I don't necessarily disagree with your reasoning, but I'm still not convinced that the absence of HttpOnly is a security _flaw_, regardless of how useful it might be.  Even Kurt's argument about everything containing XSS doesn't make me think that the lack of HttpOnly is a flaw -- the flaw is in the software.  Again, pointing to SELinux, even if we turned it on by default and made it available to the operating system, and if SELinux renders an exploitable flaw entirely ineffective, that doesn't make the flaw "not a flaw"; the flaw is still there and it's assigned a CVE.

Kurt's argument about everything having an XSS makes it sound like, and the reasoning provided here as well, that we should no longer consider XSS a security flaw, but the absence of HttpOnly the security flaw.  I mean, if setting this flag "fixes" all XSS issues, then we should no longer be assigning CVEs to XSS issues, only to web servers/services that do not set HttpOnly or browsers that do not respect/handle it properly.  They can't _both_ get CVEs or be considered flaws, can they?

I guess this is the ground where things get a little muddy.  =)
