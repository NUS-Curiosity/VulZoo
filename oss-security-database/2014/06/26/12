Based on this email and the one this is in response to, I find this comment
unclear. Is MITRE saying that:

 a) lack of implementing SELinux, AppArmor, virus scanner, firewall, <insert
    hardening software here> does not justify a CVE because of the complexity?
 b) lack of implementing SELinux, AppArmor, virus scanner, firewall, <insert
    hardening software here> does not justify a CVE and also cannot be
    considered an implementation error because of the complexity?
 c) implementing SELinux, AppArmor, virus scanner, firewall, and/or <insert
    hardening software here> is not worth it because the added complexity
    intrinsically makes the system less secure?
 d) something else?

Thanks
