Thanks for noting this, but we haven't been able to find why that
happened. We did a complete search and there's never been any e-mail
received at the cve-assign@...re.org address from any kde.org sender
or the name Richard Moore or Rich Moore. Before October 2011, we
advertised a different address, cve@...re.org, reaching different
people at MITRE, but unfortunately do not have the full archive of
that online. We sent one reply in December 2011 from
cve-assign@...re.org to a kde.org address in response to e-mail sent
to cve@...re.org (it was related to the
http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/12/07/3 post).
