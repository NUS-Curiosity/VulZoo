OK, think I got the basic idea. However, judging from a few CVE examples
on the site, it seems there is no time advantage in using this site as
compared to posts on this list. In fact the entries appear a couple of
days later in some cases. So I'm afraid this won't be of too much help
concerning the timing issue.
