Hash: SHA1

Use CVE-2014-1692. The CVE description will indicate that the issue
requires an unusual installation.

> As I understand it this can be enabled via code edit/gcc command line

An impact on the default installation isn't necessary. Vulnerabilities
that occur only after the user modifies code aren't eligible for a
CVE. However, if there's some type of "installation option" mentioned
by the vendor, someone may have chosen that option, and it may be
worthwhile to track the issue with a CVE. The nature of an
"installation option" obviously varies widely across both open-source
and closed-source products.

In this case, there's:

> http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/ssh/Makefile.inc

> Add support for an experimental zero-knowledge password authentication
> method using the J-PAKE protocol ...

> This is experimental, work-in-progress code and is presently
> compiled-time disabled (turn on -DJPAKE in Makefile.inc).

> http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/~checkout~/src/usr.bin/ssh/Makefile.inc?rev=1.41;content-type=text%2Fplain

> #CFLAGS+=	-DJPAKE

This is close to the edge of what "installation option" means, but our
feeling is that the vendor wouldn't have provided that #CFLAGS line at
all unless it were expected that an end user might want to make the
one-character change.
