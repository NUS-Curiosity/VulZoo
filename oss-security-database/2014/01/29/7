Subject: CVE Request: otrs: CSRF issue in customer web interface

Hi

A CSRF issue in otrs was announced in [1]. Is a CVE for this issue
already assigned?

>From upstream announcement:

An attacker that managed to take over the session of a logged in
customer could create tickets and/or send follow-ups to existing
tickets due to missing challenge token checks.

Commits for various branches (3.1.x, 3.2.x and 3.3.x) are in [2], [3]
and [4].

Bugreport at [5].
