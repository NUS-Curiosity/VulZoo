Morning,

In Fedora there is horde and php-horde-Horde-Util:

http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=446660
http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=449705

I am not familiar with Horde or know the difference between those 
packages, whether one is an older version and the other providing 
equivalent functionality to version 5. The github commit in the original 
message is in php-horde-Horde-Util for us.

The same vulnerability is in our horde package too, but I could not find 
this (horde-3.3.13/lib/Horde/Variables.php) in github:

21 class Variables {
22
23     var $_vars;
24     var $_expectedVariables = array();
25
26     function Variables($vars = array())
27     {
28         if (is_null($vars)) {
29             $vars = Util::dispelMagicQuotes($_REQUEST);
30         }
31         if (isset($vars['_formvars'])) {
32             $this->_expectedVariables = @unserialize($vars['_formvars']);
33             unset($vars['_formvars']);
34         }
35         $this->_vars = $vars;

Mailing here in case anyone else is shipping in a similar way (or if 
another CVE is needed?).

Cheers,
