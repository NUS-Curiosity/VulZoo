Subject: [OSSA 2014-003] Live migration can leak root disk into ephemeral
 storage (CVE-2013-7130)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-003
CVE: CVE-2013-7130
Date: January 23, 2014

Title: Live migration can leak root disk into ephemeral storage
Reporter: Loganathan Parthipan (HP)
Products: Nova
Affects: All supported versions

Description:
Loganathan Parthipan from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in
the Nova libvirt driver. By spawning a server with the same flavor as
another user's migrated virtual machine, an authenticated user can
potentially access that user's snapshot content resulting in information
leakage. Only setups using KVM live block migration are affected.
