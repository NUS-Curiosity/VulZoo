Subject: Neo4J CSRF: Potential CVE candidate

Hi,

Last August, Dinis Cruz wrote a blog entry [1] detailing a CSRF attack
on a Neo4J Server resulting in an RCE. The server's documentation [2]
mentions the following.

"By default, the Neo4j Server comes with some places where arbitrary
code code execution can happen. These are the Section 19.15,
“Traversals” REST endpoints. To secure these, either disable them
completely by removing offending plugins from the server class-path, or
secure access to these URLs through proxies or Authorization Rules."

This could mean that the RCE itself is not CVE worthy as it is a
documented/expected behavior. However, should the CSRF flaw be
considered a vulnerability and assigned a CVE?

Regards,
Arun
