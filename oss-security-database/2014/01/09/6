Subject: CVE request: tmux local denial of service (2009)

Alexander Wirt discovered that local users can block other users from 
using tmux by creating suitably named directories in /tmp:

<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=529082>

This is a minor local denial of service issue.  This was reported 
publicly in 2009, so it receive an ID for that year.

Corresponding Red Hat bug:
