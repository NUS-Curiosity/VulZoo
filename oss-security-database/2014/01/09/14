>  -> net/ax25/af_ax25.c

The unpatched code does not have the fundamental problem of updating
msg_namelen in a situation where "sax" is uninitialized.

>  -> net/rose/af_rose.c

The unpatched code does not have the fundamental problem of updating
msg_namelen in a situation where "srose" is uninitialized.

>  -> net/compat.c

This is for the case of a nonzero msg_namelen accompanied by a NULL
msg_name, as mentioned in the comment in the commit. The same choice
was made in net/core/iovec.c (a file that you didn't ask about).

>  -> net/socket.c

Lack of "msg_namelen = 0" statements is not something that would
really be considered a vulnerability in the previous net/socket.c
implementation. From the perspective of net/socket.c itself, the
"msg_namelen = 0" additions are a design improvement that can
contribute to the security of other code.

>  -> net/rxrpc/ar-recvmsg.c

The complete absence of a "msg_namelen =" statement in the unpatched
code seems to be a bug, but it's not the same as updating msg_namelen
in an uninitialized-data situation.
