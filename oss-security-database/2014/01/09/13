Subject: CVE request: remote code execution via deserialization in XStream

Hi All

As per the following email thread on the xstream-dev list:

http://markmail.org/message/kfqoqdfj5fnup5co?q=list:org.codehaus.xstream.dev&page=3

Dinis Cruz et. al. have reported a remote code execution flaw in 
XStream's XML deserialization. A PoC exploit is available here:

An initial patch has been committed, adding a whitelist that limits 
deserialization to specified types:

Please assign a CVE ID to this issue.

Thanks
