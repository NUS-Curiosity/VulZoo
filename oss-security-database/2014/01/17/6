Subject: more info on "radiotap: bitmap-end-finding buffer overrun"

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone has more info on the following commit:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/bd02cd2549cfcdfc57cb5ce57ffc3feb94f70575

AFAICS it is a different issue than CVE-2013-7027.

A web search points to the following Secunia advisory, but not much else:
http://secunia.com/community/advisories/56282

(not asking for a CVE at this time)

Cheers,
