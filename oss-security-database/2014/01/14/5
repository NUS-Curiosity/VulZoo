Use CVE-2014-1447 for this issue in which the product does not check
whether the connection is still open. This corresponds to
173c2914734eb5c32df6d35a82bf503e12261bcf, which apparently would be of
some value in some attack scenarios.


> And really fixed by v1.2.1-rc1-37-g066c8ef:

> it is possible to hit a window when client->keepalive is NULL while
> client->sock is not NULL. I was thinking client->sock == NULL was a
> better check for a closed connection but apparently we have to go with
> client->keepalive == NULL to actually fix the crash.

Use CVE-2014-1448 for this issue in which the product does not
properly check whether the connection is still open. This corresponds
to 066c8ef6c18bc1faf8b3e10787b39796a7a06cc0, which apparently is of
value in additional attack scenarios.

In deciding to SPLIT, all of these factors were considered but we
don't want to try to precisely specify whether any one factor would be
sufficient on its own:

1. There seem to be two distinct version-like identifiers,
v1.2.1-rc1-33-g173c291 and v1.2.1-rc1-37-g066c8ef, which can be
interpreted as different affected versions.

2. The first patch alone was accepted in the
https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-January/msg00532.html
and
https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-January/msg00554.html
messages.

3. http://libvirt.org/downloads.html says "Once an hour, an automated
snapshot is made from the git server source tree. These snapshots
should be usable." This suggests that a "version" with only the first
patch was, in some realistic sense, "packaged for distribution," and
could conceivably be in use somewhere.
