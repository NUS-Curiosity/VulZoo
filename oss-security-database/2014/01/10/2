Subject: CVE Request: python-jinja2: arbitrary code execution vulnerability

Hello,

Jinja2, a template engine written in pure python, was found to use /tmp 
as a default directory for jinja2.bccache.FileSystemBytecodeCache, which 
is insecure because the /tmp directory is world-writable and the 
filenames used like 'FileSystemBytecodeCache' are often predictable. A 
malicious user could exploit this bug to execute arbitrary code as 
another user.

PoC is given on the debian page: 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=734747

References:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1051421

Can a CVE please be assigned to this issue?
