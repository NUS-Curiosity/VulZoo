Subject: CVE Request - Poppler library: DoS fixed in 0.24.5

Hello.

It was discovered the JBIG2Stream::readSegments function in the
Poppler library (prior to 0.24.5) does not properly handle
segExtraBytes values, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (application crash) via a crafted PDF that
triggers a segmentation fault caused by an improper format
control string. [1]

Upstream fix: 
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/commit/?id=58e04a08afee

Would you please allocate a CVE for this issue? Thanks.
