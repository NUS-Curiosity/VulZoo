Subject: CVE request Linux kernel: netfilter: nf_nat: leakage of uninitialized
 buffer in IRC NAT helper 

    Hello,

Linux kernel built with the NetFilter Connection Tracking(NF_CONNTRACK)
support for IRC protocol(NF_NAT_IRC), is vulnerable to an information leakage
flaw. It could occur when communicating over direct client-to-client IRC
connection(/dcc) via a NAT-ed network. Kernel attempts to mangle IRC TCP
packet's content, wherein an uninitialised 'buffer' object is copied to a
socket buffer and sent over to the other end of a connection.

Upstream fix:
-------------
   -> https://git.kernel.org/linus/2690d97ade05c5325cbf7c72b94b90d265659886
