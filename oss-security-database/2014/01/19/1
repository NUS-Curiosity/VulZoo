I noticed this as well when reviewing chrony quite a while ago, but I 
did not press the issue because its restricted to localhost by default 
and the amplification factor is low, especially in packet count terms. 
At the time, I did not consider it comparable to the ntpd issue at all, 
and I still don't.

Comparable levels of amplification are present in TCP itself and many 
other UDP-based protocols.
