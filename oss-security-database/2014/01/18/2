Is this not a same/similar case?  chronyd, much like ntpd, has some commands that allow for amplification, just like ntpd does.

I'm not going to argue (I didn't assign it, I'm just reporting that it was assigned), but it struck me as being essentially the same type of flaw.  So if ntpd received a CVE for essentially the same thing, I can see why this one was assigned as well.

I'm not sure which part is inconsistent here.  Granted, chrony does not yet have a published fix, but my understanding is that is in the works.  In other words, there will be a fix of some sort (to at least reduce the amplification quite substantially).  Is that the part that seemed inconsistent?  The lack of a published fix?
