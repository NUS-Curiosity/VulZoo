I wouldn't be so certain.  :)  I've gotten dot files in email a fair bit
while working on free software projects since it's a really useful way of
expressing dependency trees and similar structures.  So the possibility of
a targetted exploit is there, particularly given that mailing list traffic
is generally completely unauthenticated.  It's not hard for someone to
pretend to be another participant and mail a doctored dot file to a
development team.  The deception would probably be discovered reasonably
quickly, but possibly not before damage was done.
