This blog posting from 2010 already describes the attack:
https://www.securepla.net/using-ntp-to-enumerate-client-ips/

| ADDITIONAL ATTACKS
| HD Moore also discussed that he had figured out a way to DDoS a
| system using NTP with very minimal requests.  Although he has not
| released data on this type of DDoS, we put our heads together here
| on what the attack could be.  When you make a monlist request, you
| send 1 udp packet to the NTP server and 600+ responses are returned.
| We think that using this request against all the NTP servers and
| peers, you could send hundreds of thousands of UDP packets to a
| victim with minimal request packets.  By spoofing the source address
| and requesting monlists repetitively, all responses from those NTP
| servers will be forwarded to the victim.
