Yes; use CVE-2013-7252.

Does anyone know whether the KWallet user interface could make it
possible to enter passwords containing 16-bit characters (i.e.,
characters that cannot be represented using 8 bits)? If that would not
be possible, then this issue could potentially qualify for an
additional CVE assignment.
