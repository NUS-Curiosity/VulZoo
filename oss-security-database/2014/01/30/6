Subject: CVE request: enlightenment sysactions

Hi,

Red Hat Security suggested I request a CVE here since this potentially
effects multiple distros/maintainers. The Enlightenment window manager
(enlightenment.org) was found to ship with (a) a setuid root helper that
did not effectively sanitize its environment and (b) a weak default
configuration. Users in select groups could exploit this to execute
arbitrary programs as root.

This was fixed upstream in 3 commits each for both e17 and e18 branches,
with two new releases shipped shortly after:
  0.17.6, Dec  4th 2013: [1], [2], [3]
  0.18.0, Dec 21st 2013: [4], [5], [6]

Fedora has a bug filed against it at [7] referencing the e18 commits.

Thanks,

Martin.
