Subject: CVE request: lightdm-gtk-greeter - local DOS due to NULL pointer
 dereference

Hi,

an openSUSE user discovered that it is trivial to crash
lightdm-gtk-greeter by entering an empty username due to a NULL
pointer dereference. When a greeter crashes the lightdm daemon
exits.
This constitutes a local denial of service which can be triggered
by any unprivileged attacker requiring the intervention of an
administrator to restart lightdm. It affects all versions of
lightdm-gtk-greeter.

The initial downstream report is at
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=857303, the bug has
been reported upstream at
https://bugs.launchpad.net/lightdm-gtk-greeter/+bug/1266449 and
fixes for the 1.1 and 1.3 series are available at
https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/home:gberh:branches:OBS_Maintained:lightdm-gtk-greeter/lightdm-gtk-greeter.openSUSE_12.2_Update/lightdm-gtk-greeter-handle-invalid-user.patch?expand=1
and
https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/home:gberh:branches:OBS_Maintained:lightdm-gtk-greeter/lightdm-gtk-greeter.openSUSE_13.1_Update/lightdm-gtk-greeter-handle-invalid-user.patch?expand=1

Could a CVE be assigned to this issue please?
