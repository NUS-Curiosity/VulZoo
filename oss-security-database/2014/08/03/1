+1. If you commit to encrypting the entire site then you can do things
like:

http://dev.chromium.org/sts
http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/http/transport_security_state_static.json

So anyone using Chrome will be forced, by their browser, to use HTTPS
for cloudsecurityalliance.org for example. I never have to worry about
SSL strip, becuase chrome will actually convert anything I type into
the address bar from the default http to https, and if I specify http
explicitly it will still send the request out as https.

You can also serve HSTS headers for browsers that don't have a
whitelist that you can be added to easily (basically all of them other
than chrome).

It's not about the users wish. It's about the site's wish. The site is
providing the service, the site provides the TOS/AUP/etc. The site may
choose optionally to leave it up to the user, but this is a VERY bad
idea.
