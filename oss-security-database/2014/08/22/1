This seems to discuss at least two non-identical issues.

http://sourceforge.net/p/enigmail/forum/support/thread/3e7268a4/#b315
and http://sourceforge.net/p/enigmail/bugs/294/ are about "an email
with only Bcc recipients is sent in plain text." This is assigned
CVE-2014-5369.

http://sourceforge.net/p/enigmail/forum/support/thread/3e7268a4/#10f1
and
http://sourceforge.net/p/enigmail/forum/support/thread/3e7268a4/#0a5a
are about one or more issues in which there is unexpected cleartext
e-mail transmission unrelated to use of Bcc. This perhaps requires a
non-default configuration. It is conceivable -- although perhaps
unlikely -- that the problem is a UI bug (e.g., an encryption choice
is presented even when the product is configured to never use
encryption). In any case, none of this has a CVE assignment yet. There
isn't enough information to determine whether to assign zero, one, or
two additional CVE IDs. The scope of CVE-2014-5369 is only the
behavior that occurs when all recipients are Bcc recipients.

Finally, these are additional (possibly related) references that
haven't yet been mentioned on oss-security:
