In such situation, we can then also wonder about other software such as
Icinga-web, where installation comes with default username and password
(properly documented). Be it using packages or "mainstream"
installation:
https://wiki.icinga.org/display/howtos/Setting+up+Icinga+Web+on+Ubuntu.
Such credentials give full access (root access) to the installation.

If Icinga wasn't configured yet, it's not such a drama, but otherwise,
it can become rather critical:
- -> Access to the whole infrastructure schema
- -> Possibility to submit checks which can help to harass a host/service
- -> Possibility to disable all the checks around to shut monitoring down
- -> Possibility to overload the master host by issuing too many checks
(master needs to handle them - MySQL dump, pnp4nagios, perf data
analysis, and so on)
