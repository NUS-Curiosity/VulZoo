Or unable to see that unless _you_ deside to log in.

Together with disabling cookies by default and wiping them on
a regular basis, that may be wise (depending of the sites you
visit, of course).

You should either trust them or avoid signing the contract :-)

However, if you suspect them in something unpleasant, you may
enforce HTTPS on _your_ side, using it everywhere (with sites
that support it).

Also, self-signed certificates (or own CA) is safer for your
users than any third-party: when a server certificate changes
without previous notice, user may be absolutely sure something
went wrong.

Is this a question?

Well, now I have a non-trivial answer to it: I've faced the error
"ssl_error_no_cypher_overlap" several times when trying to access
such HTTPS-only sites, and, instead of getting there "insecurely",
I was unable to get there at all.

Yes, I use modern OpenSSL version built without support for weak
algorithms.
