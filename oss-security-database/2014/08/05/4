Subject: CVE request: issues in ISO C++ 2011 regex library

Hello,

Maksymilian Arciemowicz reported a number of issues in the ISO C++ 2011 
regex libraries:

http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Aug/1

Bugs:

https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61601

https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61582

http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20291

For the memory corruption bug (61582), there seems to be more than one 
issue here (at least a heap-based buffer overflow and a stack overflow 
of some sort). Can a single CVE be assigned, or do you need specific 
details for each issue (I don't currently have those)?

With GCC 4.8 in Fedora, the affected program needs to be compiled using 
the "-std=c++11" option.

Thanks,
