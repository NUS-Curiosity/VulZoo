Most USB keyboards in the system do not have a unique serial number.
Heck, most USB devices in the system do not have a unique serial number,
the only USB device that is required to do so is a USB printer,
everything else is free to not have one at all, or have the same serial
number for all devices made of that type.

Never treat a USB serial number as "unique", except for a USB printer,
sorry.
