"bad"?  Why is that?  Loads of devices work this way, a whole class of
USB controller chips work exactly in this manner, they require the
firmware to be dowloaded to the device from the host operating system
before they work at all.  They are really common and cheap and used all
over the place and have been on the market since the early 1990's.

And is something that I have never seen anyone say is possible, have
you?  If so, details would be great to have.

How can a USB device get any of those things without the Host operating
system give them to it the device?

Then do just that, Linux has allowed you to do this for years, again,
but very few people take advantage of it.

express card and thunderbolt are pcie, it's fun to play with, glad to
see some "kits" to make it more accessable.

What exactly do you mean by "get it right"?

The hardware is designed to do this, the host operating system can't do
much about bad hardware, sorry.

It makes it easy to back up laptops :)
