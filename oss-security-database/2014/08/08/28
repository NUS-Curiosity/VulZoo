Reading that thread, that's exactly what I thought about that. I guess
it could be a good idea to set usbcore.authorized_default to 0 when the
systems is locked (logind could provide that information). There's still
the issue that it's then not possible to unlock the system in some
situation (for example because you had to unplug the keyboard while
logged out, or stuff like that). But at least that would be a
possibility.

I lost track of the current OSX status, but I had the impression that
they would only enable Vt-d (where present) when the systems was locked,
not always.

Note that on Linux, you can boot intel_iommu=on (or force it at compile
time). I do that since a long time now (actually since I myself found
bugs in network cards firmwares which I then used to bounce to the host,
that raised my own parano√Øa quite a lot). I also discovered that I/OMMU
(like any firmware) can be buggy too (for example on my ironlake system
I need intel_iommu=on,igfx_off for it to work), but it's apparently
better on more recent Intel systems.
