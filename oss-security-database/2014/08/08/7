ugh, that's a shame.  are there any other characteristics we could use
to gin up a phony serial number for this kind of use?  Even making an
allowlist by model number would raise the bar a little bit for a generic
attacker.

Though i suppose you could create a device that claims to be 400
different keyboards at once -- or in a rapid hotplug succession until it
finds the common model that you've already allowed :(
