From

via http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/28.14.html#subj6.1 (which seems to be
down at the moment).

The vulnerabilities aren't restricted to thumb drives.  If there's room
for a 1-wire chip in an Apple Lightning connector
(http://www.chipworks.com/en/technical-competitive-analysis/resources/blog/inside-the-apple-lightning-cable/)
then there's room for a lot more in the USB connector.  Borrowing a
cable to charge your mobile phone could become a risky business.
