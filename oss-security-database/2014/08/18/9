Um ... I see from the Enigmail "Announcements" forum [1] that some
major changes have been made to the package over the last 24 months:
specifically a decision was made to replace older C++ code (with
maintainability issues) by new pure Javascript code, thus hopefully
achieving platform, GPG and TB version independence

You can see how that sort of upheaval in the codebase might result in
horrible problems like this.

[ I switched away from TB to Claws/Kmail some time ago, so this is all
news to me, but up till that point the behaviour of TB V3 - 10 and
Enigmail 1.0/1 in encrypting my mail was never less than excellent for
me. ]

More relevantly, the (primary ?) author specifically asked [2] for
testers to step up and test the new Javascript version thoroughly

  "In order to reduce the risk of severe errors in
   the release versions, I will regularly ask for help
   in testing after I completed such changes."

which leaves me wondering how many stepped up to perform that task. It
would be interesting - and maybe alarming - to know.
