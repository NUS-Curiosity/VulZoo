Hi,

does someone happen to know in which released kernel version this bug
got introduced?

Was it always there since remounting of bind mounts was possible?

according to debian this at least affects 2.6.32 kernels
in oldstable:

https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5206
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5207

Sadly I can't find any other public available bugtracker
from redhat, gentoo etc. who track these.
