Subject: CVE Request: Enforce use of HTTPS for MathJax in IPython

All,

We would like to request a CVE for a vulnerability in the IPython notebook,
reported today by Leopold Schabel on IPython's GitHub issue tracker at
https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/6246.

Email address of requester: security@...thon.org; rgbkrk@...il.com
Software name: IPython notebook
Type of vulnerability: Use of insecure resources
Attack outcome: Remote execution
Patch/issue: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6249,
https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/6246
Affected versions: 0.12 ≤ version ≤ 2.1

Summary: When using the IPython notebook without encryption (i.e. running
the server on HTTP instead of HTTPS), mathjax is loaded over HTTP. An
attacker with fortuitous network position could execute code on a local
IPython notebook by modifying the mathjax javascript.

This issue was fixed in the git master branch (development branch for
upcoming v. 2.2) with commit cf793ebc4, on 7/31/2014:

https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/cf793ebc4f9e8483f104667e4c73748357fa8c56

Mitigations:
* Run the notebook with SSL (see
http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/notebook/public_server.html#securing-a-notebook-server
).
* Install mathjax
    from IPython.external.mathjax import install_mathjax
    install_mathjax()

Regards,

Kyle Kelley
