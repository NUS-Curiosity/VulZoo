I believe the attack here is supposed to create a collision against MD5
sums used as names of files under ~/.subversion/auth/svn.simple/.
However, as attacker does not control realm strings for any of the
trusted repositories, that would require preimage attack.  The lack of
(publicly) known efficient preimage attacks against MD5 should imply
such attack is still only theoretical.
