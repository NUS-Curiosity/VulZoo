Are you saying that the links go to a paywall now? Or simply that the
person who follows the link has some "obligation not to look" unless
they fall in one of the categories in the first group above? If what
you mean is the latter, then I think the issue only matters to parties
who are conducting large scale, programmatic access to their database.
Anyone is a "private person", and can certainly justify access to any
one record (or any reasonable amount of records) as a private person.
Only in the case of bulk automated access where it's clear that the
access is being performed on someone else's behalf or to scrape the
data, etc. is there any question.

Directly, probably not. If they decide to be jerks about it though,
people might just get fed up with dealing with them and not bother to
contribute.

At least in the US and most jurisdictions I'm aware of, copyright has
no bearing on your right to link, so I don't see this having any
effect.

In my opinion, there's something wrong with feeling obligated to pay
to access something you contributed to building with the understanding
that you were building a community resource, and even more wrong with
taking data built for you by a community and trying to restrict that
community's access to it.
