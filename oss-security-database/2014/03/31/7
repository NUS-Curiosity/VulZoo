Thanks for taking care. I was about to write a patch on my own, but seems
not necessary anymore.

However, I think that

+	if (!strlen(tty) || !strcmp(tty, ".") || !strcmp(tty, "..")) {

could be insufficient. Any occurence of "." inside tty name
should be evil. Above strcmp() matches exactly "." or "..",
but you also want "../../" etc which should pass above check.

For the ruser check, the strchr(ruser, '/') safes this, but
".." occurence may also be treatened appropriately.

Sebastian
