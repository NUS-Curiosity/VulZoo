A misconfigured server might only offer a 40-bit cipher to a peer that
offers a 40-bit cipher, but might offer a stronger cipher to a peer that
does *not* offer any 40-bit ciphers.

arguably, this involves two different misconfigurations (both server and
client), but the issue would be mitigated if the client was not offering
a weak cipher and claiming it was a successfully secure connection.

Here is another situation where konqueror successfully indicates a
"secure" connection to a server that has a known-insecure configuration:
 point konqueror at: https://demo.cmrg.net/ -- you'll see a successful
connection, though that server only offers DHE over a
trivially-crackable 16-bit group.

NSS-based browsers will throw an ssl_error_weak_server_ephemeral_dh_key
error and refuse the connection; konqueror claims it is a secure connection.
