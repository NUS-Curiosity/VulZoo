Note: Not part of KDE and not speaking on their behalf, but...

IMO SSL on KDE needs some pretty big love. Pretty sure I've discussed this and 
other aspects of SSL with the relevant people at KDE before but as with many 
aspects of KDE, noones really had time to tackle it. Basically. Konqueror 
doesn't really deal with SSL, that's delegated down the stack which ends up 
with OpenSSL. There's a lot of oddities in KDEs SSL more generally but the 
original KSSL author has abandoned it (IIRC), and no one has really stepped up 
to fill the slack.
