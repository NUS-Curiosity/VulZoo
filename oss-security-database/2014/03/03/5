As the stated purpose of encryption is to strongly protect
communications, both integrity (e.g. modification) and confidentiality
(e.g. not being able to read it) then using encryption such as DES
40/56 can be broken in single digit seconds (I'm guessing near real
time now with dedicated hard ware) and hours on standard PCs obviously
violates the stated intent of using encryption.

So the question becomes where do we draw the line? 40 and 56 are
obviously weak, standard computers, let alone something with a GPU can
crack it quickly. Do we draw the line at <128 bits, <3DES or something
else?
