Subject: TigerVNC 1.3.1 fixes ZRLE decoding bounds checking issue

Hi!

New release of TigerVNC fixes an issue with boundary checks in the ZRLE
decoding.  Boundary checks existed in the code in form of assert()s,
which were removed in builds with NDEBUG defined.  That is default for
release builds done by cmake, which is used by TigerVNC.  This could
possibly allow malicious server to compromise vncviewer.

The same problem may affect related *VNC implementations if built with
NDEBUG.

CVE-2014-0011 was assigned to the issue.
