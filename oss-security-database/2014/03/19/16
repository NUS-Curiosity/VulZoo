It would be great to know something about what it took to host the old
list, if anyone knows. There are certainly existing organizations who run
large mailing lists, have lawyers to deal with takedowns, and believe in
free access to knowledge.

Or if anyone has seen another place where this is being discussed by the FD
community, I'd welcome a pointer.
