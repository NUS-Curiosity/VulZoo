After they've been made public intentionally?

Have a look at the big picture. If Google censors a vuln in a google-related
service on such a list, they will get massive criticism, and for a business,
that's even worse.

A vuln in a Google service? That's a mistake. Intentional censoring by Google
in a place where they're supposed to be a neutral third party? That's evil.
And "Google made a stupid mistake" in the headlines is much better for them
than "Google did something evil". They won't do it, not just for ethical
reasons, but also because censoring is bad for their money.

<sarcasm>Yeah, because we've never seen an ISP with totally crappy
reactions to vuln reports.</sarcasm>
