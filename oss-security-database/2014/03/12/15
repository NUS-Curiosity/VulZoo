Many bearer token systems have this security property, which is also
shared with (e.g.) Kerberos tickets.  I think it's a security property to
be aware of, but I don't think it's a vulnerability unless the software
advertises otherwise.

Invalidating issued tokens prior to their expiration time requires storing
central session state or some revocation list equivalent, which may be an
undesireable or burdensome requirement for the security system as a whole.
Bearer tokens with expirations but without central session state
(Kerberos, for example) have some useful properties that cannot be easily
replicated by state-tracking systems, at the cost of making logout prior
to token expiration require destruction of all session keys.
