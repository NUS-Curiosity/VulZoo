FWIW, the calendar plugin does not do SSL safely anyway, which I would
worry more about:
http://www.thewildbeast.co.uk/claws-mail/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3105

Also the rssly plugin has the same issue

Note comment by author(?):
"However, while I agree that CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST should probably be
enabled, I do not see any usefulness in enabling CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER. I
do not really buy into the extortion racket that certificate authority
companies run."

(The main claws-mail has different and very extensive ssl / certificate
 handling, a bit large to review quickly for me right now.)

Ciao, Marcus
