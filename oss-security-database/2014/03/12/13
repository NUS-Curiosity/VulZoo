Subject: Cookie Reuse

Hey guys

Would you consider the following scenario a security flaw:

- User can login to an authenticated system
- User copies the cookies that are set after they are authenticated
- User logs out and the cookies are therefore deleted from their system
- User can paste the previously copied cookies allowing them to re-auth without re-entering credentials

Personally, I would feel that given the user has logged out, their expectation is that not only should the cookies be removed from their end, but essentially those cookies should no longer be accepted by the server at a later stage to re-authenticate.

If you would feel this is a vulnerability, can anyone recommend the best way to disclose this to the developer?

Kind regards,
Thomas
