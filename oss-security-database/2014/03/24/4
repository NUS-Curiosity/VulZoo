If you ask me some large commercial distros suck much.

They pissed me off on several occasions,
broke the social contract and possibly
alienated other people.

FYI yesterday you lost a CMS bug because
of the lousy CVEs. I was playing with
CMS and noticed an ``anomaly'' which
I don't feel disclosing unless I am
sure it won't get _any_ CVE.
