Subject: possible CVE request: smb4k credentials cache leak

Hi,

https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=505376 notes that smb4k (an 
SMB/CIFS share browser for KDE) version 1.1.1 fixes a potential security 
issue:

"Fixed potential security issue reported by Heiner Markert. Do not allow 
the cruid option to be entered via the "Additional options" line edit. 
Also, implement a check in Smb4KMountJob::createMountAction() that 
removes the cruid option from the custom options returned by 
Smb4KSettings::customCIFSOptions()."

http://sourceforge.net/projects/smb4k/files/Smb4K%20%28stable%20releases%29/1.1.1/

Does it need a CVE? I do not have further details, sorry.
