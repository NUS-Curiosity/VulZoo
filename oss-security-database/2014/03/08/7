Subject: CVE request: SQL injection in MODX Revolution before 2.2.13

Hello,

I'd like to have a CVE for the following issue:
http://forums.modx.com/thread/89486/modx-revolution-2-x-sql-injection#dis-post-492046

Release notes for fixed version:
http://modx.com/blog/2014/03/07/revolution-2.2.13/

I tried to find the corresponding git commit, but I was not successful.
It may be this one:
https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/commit/11a913feda16c99703dbf4d27328af888e698c5c
but I'm not sure. The bug and the commit indicate no sign of an SQL
injection fixed and I am not motivated to dig deeper into the code.
However, it is the right file and the right date.


cu,
