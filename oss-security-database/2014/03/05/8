CVE Assignment Team, et al. -

The initial fix for this problem [1] had an off-by-one flaw
that has since been corrected [2].

I am unsure of the policy regarding the issuance of new CVE 
identifiers associated with incomplete/flawed fixes associated
with previously allocated CVEs. But, in this particular case
file 5.17 shipped with [1] and not [2].
