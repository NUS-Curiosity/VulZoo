I'm happy to agree with that (as the maintainer of the drivers/staging/
tree).  Please note, that if a user does use a staging tree driver, it
will "taint" the kernel with the "TAINT_CRAP" flag, and tell the user
that they are on their own.

But I'm not in charge of CVEs, if people are looking to create a ton of
them, feel free to assign them to staging tree driver issues... :)

thanks,
