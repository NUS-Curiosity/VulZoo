Subject: CVE request for icinga 1 byte \0 overflows

Hi,

I am not sure whether this needs a CVE...

The icinga team silently fixed some single byte \0 overflows.

https://git.icinga.org/?p=icinga-core.git;a=commitdiff;h=73285093b71a5551abdaab0a042d3d6bae093b0d

(also the non public
https://dev.icinga.org/issues/5663
is referenced by commit above)


I think they all go via strcpy() into known sized stack buffers, so should
be caught by FORTIFY_SOURCE.

Probably still needs a CVE.

Ciao, Marcus
