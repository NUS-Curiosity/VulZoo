Subject: CVE request: os.makedirs(exist_ok=True) is not thread-safe in Python

Cc'ing security@...hon.org so that they are aware of the CVE assignment (so please keep them in the cc).  Just copying and pasting from the Red Hat bug:


It was reported [1] that a patch added to Python 3.2 [2] caused a race condition where a file created could be created with world read/write permissions instead of the permissions dictated by the original umask of the process.  This could allow a local attacker that could win the race to view and edit files created by a program using this call.

Note that prior versions of Python, including 2.x, do not include the vulnerable _get_masked_mode() function that is used by os.makedirs() when exist_ok is set to True.

Our bug is here: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1082177

Could a CVE be assigned to this issue please?  Thank you.
