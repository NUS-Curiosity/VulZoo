Subject: CVE request: cloud-init DNS resolution fix

Prior to version 0.7.0, cloud-init could send requests for EC2 instance 
data to untrusted systems:

https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1040200
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/trunk/revision/635

This could allow someone who has control over a suitable domain name to 
obtain root rights on an affected system.

This was reported and fixed silently in 2012, so it would need a 2012 
CVE name.

(This issue is not specific to cloud-init, there seem to be some wget 
scripts out there which exhibit the same behavior, but it's probably 
some custom stuff that's not distributed anywhere, so no CVE is needed 
for that.)
