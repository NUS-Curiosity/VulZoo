Subject: CVE-2014-0036 rubygem-rbovirt: unsafe use of rest-client

Michael Samuel of Amcom discovered that the rbovirt gem used rest-client
with SSL verification disabled. Any products making use of this gem are
likely vulnerable to MITM attacks.

This is fixed in the latest upstream release:
http://rubygems.org/gems/rbovirt/versions/0.0.24
