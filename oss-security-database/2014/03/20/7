 something better!)

Interesting idea :)

How hard is to implement?

Some human will be in technical charge.
How resistant is this against dishonest
operator?

Suggestion:  make the project easy to
install and import the DB in case it
dies too for whatever reasons.

Why not implement all alternatives?

This might cause duplicate traffic.

So far several alternatives are:

1. Public service mailing list (easy)
2. Standard mailing list (legal issues)
3. coderman's solution
4. forum or Question&Answers site (might support email)
