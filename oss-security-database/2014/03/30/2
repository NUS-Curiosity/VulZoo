Subject: Re: [OT] FD mailing list died. Time for new one

Not subscribed to oss-security.

Just for the record of the old FD,
i posted there anonymously and
even killed at least one bug in 
widely used open source warez in
un-orthodoxal way.

The CVE servants got the bug
significantly later after the
announcement :)

maybe solardiz is using the
mainstream patch i suspect.
