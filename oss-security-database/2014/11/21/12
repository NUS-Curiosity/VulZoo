Subject: CVE request: heap buffer overflow in ClamAV

Hi,

A heap buffer overflow was reported in [1] in ClamAV when scanning a specially crafted y0da Crypter obfuscated PE file.
Note that this is remotely exploitable when ClamAV is used as a mail gateway scanner.

Upstream fix is available here: [2].
ClamAV 0.98.5 contains the above fix.

[2] https://github.com/vrtadmin/clamav-devel/commit/fc3794a54d2affe5770c1f876484a871c783e91e

Can a CVE be assigned to this, please ?

Thanks,
