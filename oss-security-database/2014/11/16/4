I agree with Michal on this.
It's like saying Ritchie's fault for the fact that C does not have
inbuilt bound checking, allowing for buffer overflows...

I won't really expand on this, but my opinion is that _any_ program that
is 'trusted', such as `file' and `strings', that contains a flaw in it
that could pwn the running user, is a security risk.

I'll also add, from the `file' manpage:

`file' is also used by internals of most programs that handle any input
too. Or some variant of it(probably libmagic).


And one last point.. `vlc' is used with untrusted input(i.e .mp4s, avis,
mp3s, etc.). If somebody gets pwned because they try to watch a video
they download, is it their fault?..
