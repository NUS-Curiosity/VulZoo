Hi,

I had a quick look at unzip-6.0-12.fc20. It did not crash there for me 
but there are invalid reads and an invalid write.

For the invalid write, the problem may manifest here in memextract():

2282             memcpy((char *)tgt, (char *)G.inptr, (extent)G.incnt);

On my system, G.incnt was 52729.

Cheers,
