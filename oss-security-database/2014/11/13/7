Subject: CVE-2014-7842 Linux kernel: kvm: reporting emulation failures to
 userspace

It was found that reporting emulation failures to user space can lead to
either local or L2->L1 DoS.

In the case of local DoS attacker needs access to MMIO area or be able
to generate port access. Note that on certain systems HPET is mapped
to userspace as part of vdso (vvar) and thus an unprivileged user may
generate MMIO transactions (and enter the emulator) this way.
