Subject: CVE Request: XSS vulnerability in MantisBT 1.2.13

Please assign a CVE ID for the following issue.

Description:

The MantisBT Configuration Report page (adm_config_report.php) did not 
escape a parameter before displaying it on the page, allowing an 
attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

The severity of this issue is mitigated by the need to have a 
high-privileged account (by default, administrator) to access the 
configuration report page.

Affected versions:
 >= 1.2.13, <= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [1]

Issue was discovered by Alejo Popovici and fixed by Damien Regad
