Subject: libyaml / YAML-LibYAML DoS

libyaml and the perl YAML-LibYAML (aka YAML-XS) module based
on the same code have an "impossible" assert that can be
triggered with the following yaml.  This is a reduced testcase
of a crash found with the afl fuzzer.

      a: " 
"     b: true

In other words a crash/denial of service with untrusted yaml input.
The libyaml author was contacted on the 21st and 27th of November.
No response has been received but the issue has independently been
reported publically since:
https://bitbucket.org/xi/libyaml/issue/10/wrapped-strings-cause-assert-failure

[1] Parsing 'test.yaml': assertion "parser->simple_key_allowed || !required" failed: file "scanner.c", line 1113, function "yaml_parser_save_simple_key"

assert(parser->simple_key_allowed || !required);    /* Impossible. */
