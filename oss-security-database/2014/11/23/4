 bug to back up the argument)

I agree to both of you and to me it is an important issue. I don't want to
be infected with malware while checking whether a file is malware :-( or my
distro doing something in the background that I'm not even aware of.

Unfortunately I don't feel like I'm up to the task. But I would be very
glad if others (you two seem very qualified to me) would tackle these
problems.

If money can help with this I'd be willing to throw in a few dozen currency
units to support this cause. (I hope that doesn't reduce intrinsic
motivation?)
