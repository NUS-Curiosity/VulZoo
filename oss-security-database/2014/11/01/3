Subject: Re: SQL injection vulnerability in MantisBT SOAP API [CVE-2014-8554]

Following up on earlier messages about this issue, please note that I 
just pushed a patch to our official repository on Github [1].

We plan to release MantisBT 1.2.18 in the next few days, as we're 
finalizing fixes for a few additional issues. I'll post back here when 
the new version goes live.
