This is the same chosen-prefix attack that was used to forge
certificates.  Using md5 in
a collision-hostile environment is definitely CVE worthy, and has been
for a while. (BTW,
no CVE for rsync yet)

In the case of an unknown-prefix, HMAC[1] or anything requiring a preimage, it's
just hardening to use swap out MD5 (and SHA-1).

[1] Unless you accidentally swap the key and data fields!
