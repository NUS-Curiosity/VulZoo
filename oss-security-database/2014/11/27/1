Hi Mitre,

Please REJECT CVE-2014-8585, thanks.

Directory traversal vulnerability in the WordPress Download Manager plugin for
WordPress allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in
the fname parameter to (1) views/file_download.php or (2) file_download.php.

File file_download.php is not available in any version of WordPress plugin
"download-manager" checked SVN and latest 2.7.4 version from
https://wordpress.org/plugins/download-manager/

PoC refers to random WordPress installation with plugin named
"document_manager", which is indeed vulnerable. I sent abuse emails to few
affected targets. Plugin "document_manager" is custom and not available in WP
plugin repository.

This was noticed during http://www.wpscan.org/ development.

If I am correct OSVDB item refers to issue listed in vexatioustendencies.com,
which has different attack scenario and payloads.
