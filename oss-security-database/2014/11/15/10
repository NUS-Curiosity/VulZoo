I think many people have arj installed and click .arj files without 
hesitation too. According to Debian popcon ( 
http://popcon.debian.org/by_vote ) arj is at the 2266th place, only 4 
places behind wireshark and 6 places ahead of acroread.

Sorry, I still don't understand what you mean (perhaps my English is 
just lacking). Both `strings` and `objdump` are using libbfd (unlike 
readelf), both are used against untrusted input.

Or they can look at the extension and use something like `convert 
png:input.png ...`

Nevertheless taking one simple .doc and zzuf I get an infinite loop(?) 
at seed 58 (IIUC it's classified as DoS in LO) and SIGSEGV at seed 91. 
Hm, abiword also crashes on this case.

Well, crashing at seed 91 is not that bad -- catdoc crashes right at 
seed 0 :-(

Sure but there are enough apps which process various files -- at opening 
downloads from browsers, clicking attachments from emails or just 
clicking files in a file manager. And there are many command line tools 
which should be safe to use against untrusted files (like `strings`).

And most such programs are easy to crash. And when I say 'easy to crash' 
it means from instantly to a couple of minutes under zzuf, not a couple 
of days under afl.

Too much low hanging fruits, too little time...
