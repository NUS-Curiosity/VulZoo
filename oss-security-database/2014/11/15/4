Thanks for catching this mistake Paul. I have:

- reverted the original fix commit with incorrect string_display_line()
   https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/1bdc16e5

- pushed a new fix with string_attribute()
   https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/49c3d089

@CVE assign authority - please let me know the ID for this issue, and 
update the data from my initial request accordingly.
