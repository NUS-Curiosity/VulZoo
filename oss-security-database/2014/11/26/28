Subject: CVE request: Canto Feed URL Parsing Command Line Injection 

Can I get 2013 CVE for Canto feed URL parsing command line injection
vulnerability, thanks.

Reported in Debian BTS https://bugs.debian.org/731582 by
<the_walrus_88@...lymail.net>. Quoting the mail:

"""
I have just found a command line injection security vuln in
canto. The program fetches feeds from configured sites, and the
feeds contain URLs that people may want to visit. If a user
starts canto and chooses to go to one URL from one feed, canto
constructs a sh command line to visit the URL, but it doesn't
remove metachars. Therefore a malicious feed (owner turned bad,
man in the middle attack if fetched with http) can put in bad
data in all link and guid elements of the feed and use this to
hack the user when they visit some of the URLs. Not good. See my
conf.py and evil.rss files for an example. Sorry for my English!
