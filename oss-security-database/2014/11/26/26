I've written something similar on POODLE (and BERserk), not sure if I
posted this here before:
https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/858-Dancing-protocols,-POODLEs-and-other-tales-from-TLS.html

Not surprisingly I come to somewhat similar conclusions (protocol
downgrade protection, encrypt-then-mac etc.)
BERserk has somewhat similar problems, e.g. it's basically also a "we
don't deprecate weak/old crypto" (PKCS #1 1.5 and RSA with e=3).

But the most important conclusion from POODLE is imho: Be very careful
with implementing workarounds for broken hard/software - and don't do
them if they compromise security.
