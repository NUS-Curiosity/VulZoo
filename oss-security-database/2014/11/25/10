Subject: Re: WordPress 4.0.1 Security Release

CVE request for 9 vulnerabilities fixed in the WordPress security releases
on November 20:

 * XSS in wptexturize() via comments or posts. Unauthnticated. Affected
versions <= 3.9.2 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5). Discovered by Jouko Pynnonen.

 * XSS in media playlists. Affected versions 3.9, 3.9.1, 3.9.2, 4.0.
Reported by Jon Cave.

 * CSRF in the password reset process. Affected versions 4.0, 3.9.2, 3.8.4,
3.7.4.

 * Denial of service for giant passwords. This is the same issue as
CVE-2014-9016
in Drupal, and was reported by the same individuals to both projects. The
phpass library by Solar Designer was used in both projects without setting
a maximum password length, which can lead to CPU exhaustion upon hashing.
Reported by Javier Nieto Arevalo and Andres Rojas Guerrero.

 * XSS in Press This. Affected versions <= 4.0 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 /
3.9.3). Reported by John Blackbourn.

 * XSS in HTML filtering of CSS in posts. Affected versions <= 4.0 (except
>= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 / 3.9.3). Reported by Robert Chapin.

 * Hash comparison vulnerability in old-style MD5-stored
passwords. Affected versions <= 4.0 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 / 3.9.3). The
WordPress install have once run WordPress < 2.5 (March 29, 2008), the user
must not have logged in since the install was updated to >= 2.5, and the
user needed to have a password for which the md5 hash was something that
could be collided with due to PHP dynamic type comparisons (something like
1 in 170 million). Reported by David Anderson.

 * SSRF: Safe HTTP requests did not sufficiently block the loopback IP
address space. Affected versions <= 4.0 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 / 3.9.3).
Reported by Ben Bidner.

 *  Previously an email address change would not invalidate a previous
password reset email.  Affected versions <= 4.0 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 /
3.9.3). WordPress now invalidates this if the user remembers their
password, logs in, and changes their email address. Affected
