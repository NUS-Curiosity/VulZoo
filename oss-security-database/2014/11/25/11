Editing error. Last bullet should have read:

* Previously an email address change would not invalidate a previous
password reset email.  Affected versions <= 4.0 (except >= 3.8.5 / 3.7.5 /
3.9.3). WordPress now invalidates this if the user remembers their
password, logs in, and changes their email address. Reported by Momen
Bassel, Tanoy Bose, and Bojan SlavkoviÄ‡.
