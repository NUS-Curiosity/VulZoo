Subject: CVE Request: MantisBT SQL injection in view_all_set.php

Description:

Both the 'sort' and 'dir' parameters to view_all_set.php are 
insufficiently validated before they are used in queries by 
view_all_bug_page.php.

Both parameters are split into chunks on ','. After splitting, only the 
first two values are validated. By supplying a third value, SQL 
injection can be performed.

Affected versions:
<= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [1]
