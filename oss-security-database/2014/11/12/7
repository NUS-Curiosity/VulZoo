You may answer to the resolver directly, bypassing any filtering.
Even behind a NAT this may work (depending on your
DNS setup if theres no intermediate DNS server). In the mail-server example the
local UDP port should be reachable directly, so you can spoof
to be the legit DNS upstream and do not even are on race,
since upstream DNS will wait for your legit answer
while you are enumerating the XIDs through systemd (constant src port).
