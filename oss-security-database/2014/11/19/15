Security audits depend greatly on the configuration and use of the machine.
Having a generic security audit is practically useless.

A company would usually pay to have a security audit produced (either via
internal or external auditors) and contains very specific details about their
particular installation. These audits are regarded as sensitive and proprietary
information and not publically distributed.

Nobody has an incentive to produce generic security audits of out of the box OS
distributions and then make them publically available.

What is the problem you are trying to solve?
