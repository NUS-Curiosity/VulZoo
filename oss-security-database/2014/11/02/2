Subject: unzip -t crasher

Latest American fuzzy lop[0] tarball[1] contains a zip file that crashes 
unzip -t:

$ unzip -qt afl-0.43b/docs/samples/unzip_t_malloc.zip
foo/:  mismatching "local" filename (/UT),
         continuing with "central" filename version
*** Error in `unzip': free(): corrupted unsorted chunks: 0x00000000015d0170 ***

I'm not sure if inclusion of said zip file was intentional, but since 
the cat is already out of the bag, I thought I'll let you know.
