Subject: CVE Request - dns-sync node module


  The dns-sync library for node.js allows resolving hostnames in
 a synchronous fashion

  All versions of dns-sync prior to the release 0.1.1 were
 vulnerable to arbitrary command execution via maliciously
 formed hostnames.  For example:

    var dnsSync = require('dns-sync');
    console.log(dnsSync.resolve('$(id > /tmp/foo)'));

  This is caused by the hostname being passed through a shell
 as part of a command execution.

  I disclosed/reported this here:

        https://github.com/skoranga/node-dns-sync/issues/1

  The following commit resolves the bug:
