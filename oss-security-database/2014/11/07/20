Subject: Asking for CVE for imagemagick

Hi,

I am asking for two CVE for imagemagick (two DOS):
- Converting some specially crafted jpeg could lead to a dos (see
http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=26456)
- Converting some dcm file could lead to crash then DOS:
Fix last value in dicom_info and added missing != NULL check.

Fix a buffer overflow in dcm reader by checking the dcm file.
This problem was discovered by fuzzing some dcm file.

Thanks

Bastien
