Feel free to take a look at honggfuzz - https://code.google.com/p/honggfuzz/

It provides a crude version of unification on the basis of offending
program counter (as well as simple disassembly of the offending
instruction). It also disables address randomization to get repeatable
crashes. Example output (from testing strings-multiarch):

Usage:
honggfuzz -f in/ -r 0.1 -q -- /usr/bin/strings ___FILE___
