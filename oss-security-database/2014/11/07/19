The current versions should be pretty stable, but if you bump into any
problems, please just poke me!=)

Afl is kind of cool for tools like binutils or fileutils because it
can synthesize many formats or format variations on its own, e.g.:

But yeah, there's plenty of low-hanging fruit in libbfd right now, so
non-instrumented fuzzing will get you pretty damn far, too.
