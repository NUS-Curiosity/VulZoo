Well, rand() in Linux and ISO C standard are not threadsafe, but random(),
srandom(), etc in Linux are claimed to be threadsafe:

- pthread(7) - the function random() is listed as threadsafe
- random(3)
  Multithreading (see pthreads(7))
       The random(), srandom(),  initstate(),  and  setstate()  functions  are
       thread-safe.

But apparently they are not.

A problem ?
