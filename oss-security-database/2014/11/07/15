Ah, I forgot to add that to really know the quality of the results of 
this approach we have to ask Nick Clifton which actually worked with the 
resulted crashers. I mostly didn't look into the sources and just run 
the script which in the end prepares a tarball for uploading (modulo 
manually filtering out some garbage which I didn't yet manage to 
blacklist in the script).

Nick, any feedback appreciated.
