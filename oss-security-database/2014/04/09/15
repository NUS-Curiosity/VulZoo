Subject: Heartbleed, clients and Android

Hi,

I was asking myself some questions and I think others with more insight
into what heartbleed means may be able to answer quickly:
How does this affect client software? The PoCs we see send some
malicous payload to servers and get some memory dumps. That doesn't
affect clients?

Is this vulnerability exploitable by a Man-in-the-Middle in any way?
Can someone send a package with a wrong authentication block inside an
existing connection and therefore dump any memory from a client?

I think it's a very obvious question to be asked if we need to push all
server users of openssl or ALL users of openssl. Because the latter
would include Android. We are all pretty aware that android updates are
in large parts nonexistent.

cu,
