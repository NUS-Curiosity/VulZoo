I'm not sure who are “most major distributions”. We failed to reply in a
timely fashion to that mail (but that's on us), but apparently so did
Ubuntu, Suse sent a mail but got apparently no reply.

In any case, two days notice is a bit out of our comfort zone for
preparing updates, but I think we would have managed to handle it
properly if the embargo didn't break.

So again thanks Red Hat for notification/coordination job, but I'm still
puzzled at what happened earlier, before Red Hat was informed.
