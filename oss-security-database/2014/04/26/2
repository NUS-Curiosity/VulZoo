Hi,

This was discovered (and resolved) in pre-release Ubuntu 14.04. Whilst it
was only this status by 1 day, the exposure risk is to brave early adopters
and developers.

Whilst technically it was present in a Unity release, I cannot think of any
other consumer of Unity than Ubuntu. As the exposed version of Ubuntu
wasn't released, it would seem fair to consider the two together.

I am aware that on occasion CVE's have been issued for development
snapshots, but I haven't seen clear policy on this.

I am not sure if this should be considered widely distributed or not. It
would seem redundant to raise a CVE for inflight development snapshot.
Unless, you believe the exposure to warrant it?

I'm sure someone from Ubuntu Security will chime in, but thought it wise to
respond to avoid an ID being raised in potential error.

Thanks
