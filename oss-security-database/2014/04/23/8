Apparently I was disgraphic when I copied that line.  My apologies.

When rebasing ontop of net this patch goes away.  I only addressed this
issue at all because that was one of the capable calls that needed to be
fixed for the second issue, and the permission check really did need to
be moved to be correct from the dump context.  As the skb available in
that function was the skb to write data into, not the skb of the netlink
request we were authenticating.

Yes.  The rest of the patches are just cleanups and infrastructure to
allow that change to happen.
