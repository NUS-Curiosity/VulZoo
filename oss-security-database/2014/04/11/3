Subject: CVE request -- Linux kernel: net: ping: refcount issue in
 ping_init_sock() function

A flaw was found in the way ping_init_sock() function handled group_info
struct reference counter. Since group_info refcounter is only
incremented but never decremented in this codepath, it could lead to
refcounter overflow and possibly to use-after-free issue later.

An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
