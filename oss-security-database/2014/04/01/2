Subject: CVE Request: Shaarli: Several XSS in index.php

Hi

Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were reported in
Shaarli, which can be found in upstream issue[1].

 [1] https://github.com/sebsauvage/Shaarli/issues/134

The issues were fixed upstream by commit
53da201749f8f362323ef278bf338f1d9f7a925a [2].

 [2] https://github.com/sebsauvage/Shaarli/commit/53da201749f8f362323ef278bf338f1d9f7a925a

Could a CVE be assigned for this flaw? (One is sufficient, as it is one
reporter and one affected file?).

Regards,
Salvatore
