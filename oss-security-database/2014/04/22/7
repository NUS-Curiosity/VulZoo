OpenSSL does not really care about host names, so you have to look at 
the chain more or less manually.  I suspect it's okay to look at subject 
alternative names of the end entity certificate exclusively if one 
certificate in the chain has a name constraint.  The PKIX validation 
code in OpenSSL should enforce the name constraints, and ignoring the 
subject distinguished name should be sufficient to give these checks teeth.

It is, however, against the RFC.  The PKIX WG says that we should just 
assume that CAs issue compliant certificates, which completely misses 
the point of name constraints (at least what they mean to me, I expected 
them to contain the impact of non-compliant CAs).
