Subject: CVE Request: indicator-datetime issue

Hello,

It was discovered that indicator-datetime 13.10.0+13.10.x would incorrectly
allow Evolution to be opened while at the greeter screen. A local attacker could
possibly use this issue to obtain unconfined local access.

Bug reports:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/indicator-datetime/+bug/1246812

Fix:
http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~indicator-applet-developers/indicator-datetime/trunk.13.10/revision/282

Could a CVE please be assigned to this issue?

Thanks,

Marc.
