(Similar to msw, I also apologize for unsigned email coming from my 
@amazon.com address.)

I can also confirm that Anthony is the right person for this ask, from 
Amazon's perspective.

If you're looking for internet confirmation of my role as the manager of 
the team that produces the Amazon Linux AMI, please see:

http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/03/amazon-linux-ami-201303-now-available.html

http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2013/09/amazon-linux-ami-201309-now-available.html

And if you're looking for confirmation of my history working with Linux 
before Amazon, I expect that Bill Nottingham, Mark Cox, Josh Bressers, 
and other current or former Red Hatters could provide that.

Thanks,
Max
