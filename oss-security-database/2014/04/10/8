Subject: Re: Should openssl accept weak DSA/DH keys with g = +/- 1 ?

Someone suggested not using self signed certs.
Created RSA CA and DSA cert with g=1

$ openssl x509 -text -in certg=1.pem
G:    1 (0x1)

#server
$openssl s_server -accept 8888 -cert ./certg=1.pem -key certg=1.key -CAfile ./cacert.pem -www

#client
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:8888 -showcerts -CAfile cacert.pem
Verify return code: 0 (ok)

Works in konqueror but not on firefox/nss for me.
