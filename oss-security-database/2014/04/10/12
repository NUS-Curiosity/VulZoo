Matt commented earlier.  Max will also confirm.  Is that sufficient?

Between the three of us, there should be enough public evidence and
enough people already on the list who have worked with one of us in
the past.

We typically post to mailing lists from personal addresses due to
DKIM.  I don't know if we have participated or not previously.  I have
certainly participated in the past regarding QEMU security
vulnerabilities but that would be with my previous employer and/or my
personal address.

That's a fair point.  We have other mechanisms to get security
bulletins but more of our folks should subscribe to oss-security too
(and that's why I'm subscribed now :-)).

http://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/security-bulletins/

A few days of advance notice enables us to respin our AMI instead of
just providing a package update.  That's a big difference for our users.

> How are users being notified of them?

We use the page above, the MOTD in the actual AMI, and the RSS feed
from the bulletin page.

> How are users supposed to install them?

Via yum.  We also auto-install critical updates on boot if the user
chooses to enable that.  We also respin the AMI if the vulnerability
is critical enough to ensure that new launches are patched.

Indeed.

Hopefully I answered what you were looking for.  I am more than happy
to answer additional questions.

Understood.  We appreciate the consideration.
