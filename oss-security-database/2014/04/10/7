Perhaps Google "Anthony Liguori site:qemu.org"

Apologies for not having PGP set up for my work email.

I can confirm that Anthony is one of several correct people for
dealing with security issues relating to Amazon Linux AMI. Cristian
Gafton and I also deal with security issues, as we did in the Olden
vendor-sec Days at Red Hat and rPath. I've added Mark Cox to CC: in
case he'd like to weigh in on our backgrounds.

Max Spevack, previous Fedora Project leader and the manager in charge
of Amazon Linux AMI, is also on Cc:.

Today we're just looking to get Anthony added to linux-distros as the
primary contact.
