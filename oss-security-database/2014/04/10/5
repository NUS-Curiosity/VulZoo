So first off I'm inclined to have Amazon on the distros list (same
reasons as Oracle basically).

My only concern is are you the correct person, I have no clue who is
on the Amazon security team for their Linux distribution, I've never
seen you post anything anywhere.

Your search - site:aws.amazon.com Anthony Liguori - did not match any
documents.

Your search - site:aws.amazon.com aliguori@...zon.com - did not match
any documents.

Can we somehow get confirmation from Amazon that this is the right
person to have on distros? Thanks.
