We reported the issue to OpenSSL a couple of hours before the advisory
was published. Our plan was to start notifications to distros and
other vendors after discussing with OpenSSL. Codenomicon did mention
us as the coordinator in the original text of heartbleed.com, but the
current text reflects the situation quite well:

"""
Who coordinates response to this vulnerability?

NCSC-FI took up the task of reaching out to the authors of OpenSSL,
software, operating system and appliance vendors, which were
potentially affected. However, this vulnerability was found and
details released independently by others before this work was
completed. Vendors should be notifying their users and service
providers. Internet service providers should be notifying their end
users where and when potential action is required.
