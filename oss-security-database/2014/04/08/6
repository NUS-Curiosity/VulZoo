Subject: CVE request Linux kernel: IB/core: crash while resolving passive
 side RoCE L2 address in cma_req_handler

   Hello,

Linux kernel built with the InfiniBand communication link(CONFIG_INFINIBAND)
along with the support for Remote Direct Memory Access(RDMA) over Convered
Ethernet(RoCE), is vulnerable to a crash caused by invalid memory access.
It occurs while trying to resolve RoCE L2 address on the server side.

A remote unprivileged user/program could use this flaw to crash the kernel,
resulting in DoS.

Upstream fix:
