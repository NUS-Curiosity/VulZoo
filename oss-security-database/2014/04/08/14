Basically from my understanding of CVE:

world readable log file with sensitive information in it? Gets a CVE.

world readable log file, nothing sensitive in it? Hardening, no CVE.

Now what defines "Sensitive"? Some services MUST log sensitive
information to be useful, e.g. WWW logs with the GET request which can
contain form data passed via GET. Some will almost never log sensitive
information unless placed into debug mode for example. So there is a
huge grey are in the middle. This is offset by the occasional bug like
"Service X log password under weird condition Y" which then makes that
world readable log file a problem.

This also applies to configuration files, some are fine to be readable
(/etc/passwd) and some are not fine to be readable (/etc/shadow).
