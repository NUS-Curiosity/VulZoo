Subject: CVE ids for CyaSSL 2.9.4?

Hi,

[CC'ing Ivan Fratric and one of the many @wolfssl addresses I found]

CyaSSL 2.9.4 fixes a number of security issues.

>From [3]:
> Issue #1 (Memory  Corruption)
> Issue #2 (Out of bounds read)
> Issue #3 (Dangerous Default Behavior, out of bounds read)
> Issue #4 (NULL pointer dereference)
> Issue #5 (Unknown Critical Certificate Extension Allowed)

Have CVE ids been assigned already? if not, could they be assigned?

Thanks in advance.
