I wish it were so.  I think it is not.

Note that a significant percentage of reports come from external people
(not list members), and a significant percentage of them are reporting
an issue to one of these lists for the very first time.  This is a
reason why they may miss list policies stated on the wiki.  They'd
similarly miss "an agreed upon way to take disclosure dates", and it'd
be a job probably for a human to notice and explain this to them.  Well,
maybe we could have a script notice the start of a new thread and the
lack of a properly formatted proposed disclosure date in the first
message, and that script would send e-mails complaining about that.

To detect case #2, it'd need access to archived messages.  Right now,
the list server does not store messages in a form it can decrypt later.

OK, a list member could run that script, entering their key passphrase
once in a while (such as to read new mail and also to run the checks).

I don't mind you giving this approach a try.  Whatever helps you get the
job done while not putting the sensitive info at too high a risk.

OK.  And you also need a way to indicate whether a posting specifically
to oss-security has already been made.  And someone (also a script?)
should check that a posting to oss-security (on that very issue) has in
fact been made (match by CVE ID mention, assuming there was one assigned?
but sometimes there won't be, e.g. in case an issue is determined to be
non-security, yet per policy needs to be brought to oss-security anyway).

It gets tricky, I think to the point where doing it semi-manually is
better.  We're not processing a huge number of issues.  Tracking the
currently open issues e.g. via a tiny text file is viable.  Someone just
needs to do it consistently.

Realistically, I wouldn't expect anyone to use the code that you might
send a pointer to.  I suggest that you start by doing the job yourself,
whether manually or with help of scripts you might write.

As to all list members participating, I think this is overkill and it
won't work reliably, just like it has been occasionally failing so far
(when it's everyone's responsibility, it's also no one's).

I want a specific person (or two, but not many) responsible for this.
We can (and should) ask others to follow list policies, but this doesn't
eliminate the need for some of us to ensure that policies are followed.

Thanks,

P.S. BTW, I think it's in fact better if you post from your personal
address, because when you post from your Amazon address your
envelope-from keeps changing, preventing whitelisting.  And there's the
DKIM issue you mentioned.
