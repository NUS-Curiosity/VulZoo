Hi.

I don't think DKG was suggesting the GnuTLS API is vulnerable to
protocol downgrade attacks if used according to guidelines (I know I
wasn't).

His question relates to your "only browsers" comment, which as my attack
against Thunderbird+IMAPS shows, is inaccurate. My second link contains
a similar mistake by Red Hat.
