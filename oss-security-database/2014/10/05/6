Hanno,

I've downloaded your bash test script and executed it against a Debian
7 (Wheezy) -patched system (upper image)

as well as a local Debian Sid (unstable) build of bash where I applied
the October 02, 2014, bash43-029 (Bottom image)

Thus agreeing with Sona: "but I think what most (non-expert) people
need is an explanation for each CVE, a set of test case from some
reliable source (preferably a script that runs all test cases and
shows vulnerable/not-vulnerable status) and a set of patches. So that
they can apply the patches, run the tests and assert that their
systems are not vulnerable to shellshock anymore."
