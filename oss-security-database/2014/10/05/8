This shows that your two systems are not vulnerable.

A "vulnerable but non-exploitable" condition doesn't actually exist.
It only means there's a non-security bug that would have been a security
bug under different circumstances (which is why it got a CVE ID).

You only need the one-liner test from my reply to Sona:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/05/7

testfunc='() { echo bad; }' bash -c testfunc

(Besides, tests for some of those CVEs can't be made reliable anyway.)
