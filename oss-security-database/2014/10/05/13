I think you're exaggerating my contribution when crediting me for this
simple test, and it's not that new either - I previously included it in:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/29/1

and Michal included it in:

http://lists.openwall.net/full-disclosure/2014/10/01/11

(I linked to Paul Vixie's reply here because it specifically focuses on
this test rather than on the rest of Michal's lengthy posting.)

As to your timeline, you may add:

Mon, 22 Sep 2014 07:16:35 +0200 - notification by Florian Weimer to the
(private, PGP-re-encrypting) distros list, with no detail and an offer
to request detail from the Debian security team.  Specifically, the
message had "CVE-2014-6271 in bash" as the Subject and it said only:

"At 2014-09-24 14:00 UTC, we are going to disclose a significant
security vulnerability in bash.

Please contact the Debian security team at <team@...urity.debian.org>
to receive details and upstream patches.  Today, this alias will be
staffed at least until 21:00 UTC (13:00 PDT)."

(Personally, I chose to wait 2 days until public disclosure, so I did
not request the detail on behalf of Openwall.)

September 25, 2014 5:41 PM (unclear timezone) - Antti Louko suggests in
a comment on Bruce Schneier's blog how bash could be binary-patched, but
provides no analysis as to why this works (so it was likely unclear and
not convincing to readers), nor a specific way to apply the patch.

September 27, 2014 7:06 AM (unclear timezone) - Antti Louko posts "a
simple Python script to make the patch", still without analysis.

I mentioned the above two comments in:

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/29/6

And if you really want to credit me for anything, then:

4:36 PM - 28 Sep 2014 (unclear timezone) - @solardiz [hey, that's me]
tweeted a one-liner bash binary patch, which turned out to be patching
bash in the same way as Antti Louko had suggested:

Mon, 29 Sep 2014 04:44:05 +0400 - oss-security posting on the above,
including analysis of why it works and what risks are involved.
