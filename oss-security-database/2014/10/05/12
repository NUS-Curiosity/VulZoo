Subject: Re: Shellshocker - Repository of "Shellshock" Proof of
 Concept Code

Ladies and Gents, I'm the owner of the repo in question and would love
to fix any misgivings you have with the list. But as you are the
experts it would be awesome if you could help me understand which
parts exactly are incorrect, or what you think should be added to help
people better understand. I'll try to consolidate the statements in
this thread, but would greatly appreciate any pull requests or issues
posted to https://github.com/mubix/shellshocker-pocs/issues that could
help me with that process.


Thanks,
