Subject: Re: strings / libbfd crasher

I've checked the upstream patch they pointed me to:
https://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=bd25671c6f202c4a5108883caa2adb24ff6f361f

Unfortunately this mixes in another change that is a revert, so it
doesn't apply cleanly to the current release (2.24), if anyone needs it
I've re-diffed it:
https://files.hboeck.de/binutils-2.24-fix-crash.diff

This fixes the original stringme and strinmetoo from mancha, but not
the latest sample von Michal:

I checked with the upstream patch and this seems still vulnerable.

I fully agree. I wasn't aware strings does any kind of executable
parsing and I was very surprised that there is any attack vector at all
against it at all.
