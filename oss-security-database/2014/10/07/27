There are two bugs: Calling “eval” on untrusted input (a relatively 
common issue), and the fact that this particular code path should never 
have been exposed to the network at all.  The second part is not 
strictly a bash bug, even if we addressed that with a change in bash. 
If this issue had been discovered when the first CGI-enabled web server 
was implemented, maybe it would not have been called a bash bug, but a 
bug in how CGI used environment variables.
