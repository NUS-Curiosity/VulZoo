I am not saying I arrived at the above lesson.  Notice the word
"arguably".  No change to distros list membership is being proposed.

Also, you're quoting only part of the context.  More context for Chet:
http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/07/7

I also mention the "diametrically opposed" reasoning in the very posting
you replied to.

Why, here's the timeline:

Of course.

Unfortunately, those same people were also less productive than usual at
their other duties (including security-related) during this time period.

No, it is not "my solution".

I hope this concern is well understood by all of us.

That said, Tavis actually was on the old vendor-sec, and I think it's
not a mere coincidence.  I just had to ask myself a "what if" question:
what if I kept the original vendor-sec membership intact, including the
security researchers?  So I did consider this question now, in public.

Perhaps more importantly, it wouldn't necessarily have taken a specific
lucky person to find and insist that the parser needed to be removed
from exposure, nor to find any additional parser bug.  All it would have
taken is someone capable actually tasked with reviewing the related
functionality in bash for potential further issues.  So maybe having
this responsibility assigned to some particular people would be of help.
Not a complete solution indeed, but it might work better than what we
have now.  I am just thinking aloud here.

I think I brought up the same concerns in the message you replied to.

It sounds like it's obvious to you that we've seen a case of "over-use"
of embargo and that "few" people "consider the negative effects".

Like I wrote in the previous message, and putting it into different
words now, I find that it is possible that embargo was over-used in this
case, but this is far from obvious to me.  I notice both negative and
positive effects that it had.  The fast-paced post-initial-disclosure
patching of further issues would likely not have been as fast without
upstream and distros having already started working together under the
embargo.  For example, for some distros, it is quicker to merge another
patch and rebuild a package when the same package has already been
updated just days ago, and with a patch in a similar area, than when it
hasn't been updated in months or years (especially for old yet still
maintained branches of the distro).

I think many people consider negative effects of embargoes, and my
message was aimed at those aspects too.

Whenever I am asked for advice on whether to report an issue to the
distros list (not often, but there were a few occasions where people
asked me first), I usually direct the reporter to post to oss-security
right away instead.  I host the distros list primarily because embargoes
exist anyway, like e.g. in the Shellshock case the issue was being
handled under an embargo for 10 days before it reached distros (for 2
days more).  I think the distros list role in this was mildly positive.
