No, imho you can not blame a single person, but you can blame
huge multi billion dollar companies who incorporate software and
benefit from it, but don't want anything to do with fixing or
improving it.

If GM buys some breaks from $random_guy (hey, he even
gives them away for FREE!) they are still liable if these
breaks don't work in their cars.

so at least when you're making money of software you should
be responsible for this software.

that's also not just my opinion (and I didn't invent these
thoughts), some credit has to go out to mr Schneier who
you might happen to know ;)
