I think there was one and simple way to prevent heartbleed, renegotiation
bugs etc altogether: STOP inventing and enabling by default useless "cool"
features. Leave TLS functionality alone, it is overengineered enough
already. If you think it would be "cool" to teach it a few new tricks, make
it disabled by default for users who never need it.
