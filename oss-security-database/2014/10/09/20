Subject: [OSSA 2014-034] Swift metadata constraints are not correctly enforced
 (CVE-2014-7960)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-034
CVE: CVE-2014-7960
Date: October 09, 2014
Title: Swift metadata constraints are not correctly enforced
Reporter: Rajaneesh Singh
Products: Swift
Versions: up to 2.1.0

Description:
Rajaneesh Singh reported a vulnerability in the way Swift enforces
metadata constraints. By adding metadata in several separate calls, an
authenticated attacker can bypass the max_meta_count constraint,
potentially resulting in the storage of more metadata than allowed in
configuration.

Juno (development branch) fix:
https://review.openstack.org/125360

Icehouse fix:
https://review.openstack.org/126645

Notes:
This fix will be included in the upcoming 2.2.0 Juno release.
