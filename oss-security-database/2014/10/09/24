That's not right,
a french trader went to jail for taking to high risks
and loosing some billions at the market:

(okay it turns out he did get out, but needs to
wear some electronic tag still).

Also:

Even if you would be right and there would be no rules
in the financial sector I would argue that this is no counter
argument at all to not make new rules.
I would argue those rules should also applie to financial
sectors as well.

kind regards

Sven
