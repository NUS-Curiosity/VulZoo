Here is where a tinfoil hatter like myself has to disagree.  No, as a TH 
I have no 'proof' of the widespread impact I believe exists.  But 
neither did any us about the the fears that Snowden gave 'proof' of 
years after much rational distrust and reasoned threat assessments by 
THs like myself.

I 'believe' (call it a cyber religious belief) that the impact of 
software vulnerabilities on us is hardly 'limited' in the sense you 
suggest.  I 'believe' that organized criminal groups, including the CIA, 
the NSA, the Mafia, the Triads, and others have already used these 
software vulnerabilities to collect a Kompromat database on everyone in 
the world.  I 'believe' this because I have a degree in computer 
engineering, and I've smoked a lot of cannabis, and I have a deviously 
creative mind.  For years prior to Snowden, I was certain the sorts of 
shenanigans that Snowden revealed were taking place.  My only evidence 
was my own knowledge of the sorts of things that were technically 
possible, and a view of the sorts of things the human race was known to 
have done repeatedly in the past.  (and some exposure to the culture of 
silicon valley)

Even today, there are nuanced aspects of how the Snowden thing is 
playing out that lead me to be ever more certain that more nefarious 
things are going on (read: Kompromat based control of global and local 
politics).  Just the way certain stories are more and less covered and 
how they are covered.  Certain things don't make sense to me outside the 
possibility that key elements are still being withheld from the public 
discourse for no other reason I can imagine than threats of violence or 
economic persecution against those that would elevate them in the public 
discussion.  Go read a timeline of snowden in 20 years akin to the 
shellshock timeline recently discussed here.  There are things that make 
no _reasonable_ sense.  There is some heinously big shit going on here. 
  I.e. I strongly believe that despite all the rhetoric, the U.S. 
government has, and continues to _shield_ the citizenry of the world 
from the extent of (tying back into topic) "the (not so limited) impact 
of software vulnerabilities".

The idea that organized criminal outfits, in league with, or under the 
moniker of the NSA/CIA/FBI might already be controlling US politics with 
a Kompromat database of dirty laundry intercepts, is something that you 
aren't going to hear about in a presidential debate or on the pages of 
the NYT.

Again, I have no proof of this.  I just have a mother that grew up in 
and around Berlin throughout WW2, and a knowledge of the history of the 
East German Stasi.  And COINTELPRO, SNOWDEN, COTTONMOUTH, etc, etc, etc.

Anyway, TL;DR, tinfoil hat, whatever.  I just felt the need to vent, 
because I agreed with the overall insightfulness of the rest of the 
comments.  But a difference in perception on the limited issue of how 
software vulnerabilities have really impacted global human life, can 
make a lot of difference to how you look at things.

Take BadUSB for instance.  I have no evidence that 
NSA/CIA/FBI/Mafia/Triads are crawling around my firmwares.  I just know 
the sorts of things they could accomplish with a few key bribes and 
threats to employees of tech firms, and the tech firms whose tech the 
other tech firms use to develop and deploy their tech.  And what they 
could do with the ability to record from the microphones of every wifi 
connected laptop with a built in mic, and mobile phone.  Even if they 
lacked the storage requirements to collect an en-masse Kompromat 
database that includes my own privacy being violated, the fact that they 
can leverage privacy violations against today's 14 year old boys and 
girls who will become the mayors and senators of the next generation... 
scares the living shit out of me.  I pretty much assume it was already 
done to past generations, and is responsible for much of the shape of 
the current world structure.  The current world structure which leads to 
issues like security vulnerabilities from closed source firmwares being 
swept under the rug, and assured as not having a serious impact on our 
lives.  So that we don't decide to fundamentally reevaluate the big 
picture in a way that will actually cause any meaningful change.

Wise words.  In some sense as I get older, I get less confident in my 
paranoid conspiracy theories.  On the other hand- 
Snowden/PRISM/ParallelConstruction/Stasi/etc...
