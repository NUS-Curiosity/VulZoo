Not in this case.  A Haskell implementation of the POSIX "sh" specification,
that then added function imports, could have made the same mistake
just as easily.

I'm all for switching to safer languages where it makes sense; many
problems are completely prevented by them.  Heartbleed, for example,
would have been prevented in almost all languages *except* C and C++,
as I have already publicly noted here:
 http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/heartbleed.html#safe-language

But let's not oversell the tools.  Shellshock was the running of data
as a command in program whose *purpose* was to be a command interpreter.
A rewritten Haskell version (for example) could do it just as easily.

Also, I think you're underestimating the cost of language switching.
It is a *big* deal to switch languages in an existing code base.
Educating developers is less risky, way faster, and costs less too.
