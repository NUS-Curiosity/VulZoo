Jose,
It is important to note that the BASH running on z/OS was a proof of
concept from 2001-2002. It was part of a Redbook project and is not part of
any supported IBM z/OS product. IBM suggests that customers keep current
with the latest version of BASH, downloading the source from GNU or working
with vendors like Rocket Software to get a supported version.

Regards,
    Peter

I was surprised a (vulnerable) bash has been ported to IBM z/OS
