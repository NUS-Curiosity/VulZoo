I updated the wikipedia page:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures#Description

Description
This is a standardized text description of the issue(s). One common
entry is:

** RESERVED ** This candidate has been reserved by an organization
or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem.
When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this
candidate will be provided.

This means that the entry number has been reserved by Mitre for an issue
or a CNA has reserved the number. So in the case where a CNA requests a
block of CVE numbers in advance (e.g. Red Hat currently requests CVEs in
blocks of 500), the CVE number will be marked as reserved even though
the CVE itself may not be assigned by the CNA for some time. Until the
CVE is assigned AND Mitre is made aware of it (e.g. the embargo passes
and the issue is made public), AND Mitre has researched the issue and
written a description of it entries will show up as "** RESERVED **".
