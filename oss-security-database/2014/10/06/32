Thanks for your feedback Dave.
Then, some naive question: are we sure that OpenSSL as shipped in
distributions is tested against such regressions (if such test
actually exists)? It's indeed something that a compiler might break
(be it due to a bug or due to an optimization).
He might be using OpenSSL as shipped in his distribution. This would
be quite damaging.

Reproducibility in behavior is kinda critical here to make sure we're
always cryptosecure.
