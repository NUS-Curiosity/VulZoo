> Getmail 4.45.0 added IMAP4-over-SSL certificate hostname validation.
> POP3-over-SSL remained vulnerable to MITM attacks.

The CHANGELOG says:

  Version 4.46.0

      -add missing support for SSL certificate checking in POP3 which broke
      POP retrieval in v4.45.0.  Requires Python 2.6 or newer.  Thanks: "mancha".

This depends on the interpretation of "broke POP retrieval."

Do you mean that, in version 4.45.0, the client sent credentials over
a POP3-over-SSL connection, and actual POP3 mail retrieval failed
after credentials had already been sent? That behavior could have a
CVE ID.

Or do you mean that, in version 4.45.0, the POP3-over-SSL connection
was never fully established, and the client would not have sent
credentials? In other words, a MITM attack could succeed but there
would be no security impact? That behavior would not have a CVE ID.
