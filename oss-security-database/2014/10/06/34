I don't think it happened on Twitter - using advanced search with date
ranges, I don't see any mentions that would predate this article,
which already seems to be using the term:

http://www.csoonline.com/article/2687265/application-security/remote-exploit-in-bash-cve-2014-6271.html

It's odd that an article posted at 8 AM on Sept 24 would have any idea
of how the bug is already being called by the security community,
especially ahead of any Twitter buzz. But both Stephane and Florian
implied that some of the pre-notified parties apparently started
leaking details to the press and were getting ready to make a splash
the moment it goes public, so maybe that's the explanation.
