qmail is vulnerable:
http://marc.info/?l=qmail&m=141183309314366&w=2

However I think this is probably not aimed at something. It's likely
just "try if we find something vulnerable, we don't care what it is".

Btw: at least one of the exploit scripts is still online. This is one
of the issues that comes with this event: There are *many* hosts out
there that have a very bad abuse handling. These things stay online
far too long.
