The potential for large negative offsets due to integer overflows was
introduced to rsyslog via their first set of patches meant to fix
CVE-2014-3634. This has since been corrected and assigned CVE-2014-3683.  

In sysklogd's case, the priority is masked by (LOG_FACMASK|LOG_PRIMASK)
which means the possible range for priorities is 0-1023 (192-1023 being
invalid). So, that overflow vector doesn't exist in sysklogd (which
never adapted rsyslog's first fix). At most you get a facility of 127
while f_pmask has size 25, ergo OOB access.

I have done enough testing that I am relatively confident no security
impact exists other than the aforementioned message-processing issues
which would apply to the would-be attacker's own message. That said,
applying the fix eliminates all doubt.
