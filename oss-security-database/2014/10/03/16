        * readline.c: rl_insert ().  Optimized for large amounts
          of typeahead.  Insert all insertable characters at once.

        * I update this too irregularly.
          Released 1.03.

        * variables.c: make_var_array (), initialize_shell_variables ()
          Added exporting of functions.
