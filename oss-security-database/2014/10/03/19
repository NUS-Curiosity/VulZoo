No worries.

The version I used was at: http://www.oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bin/old/bash-1.05/variables.c
Full tar: http://www.oldlinux.org/Linux.old/bin/old/bash-1.05.tar

Brian Fox even wrote a UseNet post advertising the feature on September 8th, 1989 -- just over 25 years before you showed the rest of us that it was a vulnerability in disguise:

If anyone has a copy of bash-1.02 or bash-1.03, I'd love to see it. It should be floating around some of the old NeXT archives.
