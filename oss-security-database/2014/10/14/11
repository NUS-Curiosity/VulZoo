I agree, but the OpenSSL folks have always been fairly resistant to
changing things that might "break compatibility", or at least it seems
that way.

This same type of argument came up when trying to get Ruby to use
better OpenSSL settings by default
(https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/9424). Everybody wants to blame
somebody else. Nobody wants to possibly be on the hook when things
break.
