I think one has to assume if a user has unrestricted sftp access, they can
figure out how to do most anything. Even with the upstream hardening patch,
it really only protects the sftpd process. Any other processes the user may
own could be modified.

I would hesitate to call this a security issue, if we do I think we open a
can of worms.
