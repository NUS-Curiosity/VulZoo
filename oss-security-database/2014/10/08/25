While it is too late for our hardware etc. perhaps strong type systems such as
found in Haskell can help here? It is known to be very good at avoiding
undefined or unexpected runtime behavior. Too late also for current languages
to have this bolted on but if anyone wanted to write "secure" software I'd be
looking at languages which provide some more guarantees. Too late for bash
also, of course which I suppose points us back at the original problem.
