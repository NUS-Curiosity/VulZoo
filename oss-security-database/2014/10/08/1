Our perspective is that, on balance, that's a preferable way to
proceed. Probably very few people outside of Red Hat would understand
whether "private entitlement keys" tend to cause problems for
customers. If you had a situation where:

  - disclosure of an entitlement key didn't matter much
    because the key is node-locked to the hardware of
    a specific customer

  and

  - bugs sometimes caused customers to have a wrong key

then you probably wouldn't want a third party obtaining a CVE ID based
on a guess that "entitlement key" seems roughly the same as sending
the full contents of the /root/.ssh directory.
