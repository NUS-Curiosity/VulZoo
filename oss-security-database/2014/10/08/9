I reported this to the OpenSSH developers, and although they included my
patch as a mitigation, they did not treat it as a vuln in OpenSSH.

I believe that treating this as a hardening patch makes sense. The SFTP
server behaves exactly as documented, it allows access to the whole
filesystem. And on Linux, that happens to equal write access to the
process RAM, so you should never give that access to someone who
shouldn't be able to run arbitrary code.
