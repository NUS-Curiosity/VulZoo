Hi,
first, please let me thank you for your very valuable input, Sebastian.

We (me and d_ed, David Edmundson) took a look at this. Although we don't  
believe any of the issues you reported could lead to a privilege  
escalation (as some of the resulting bugreports suggest), we consider them  
to be security issues.
Currently, there are two pull requests open [1] [2] potentionally fixing  
all mentioned issues. We're waiting for peer review from the other  
developers and possibly yours, too.

Cheers,
Martin
