Clearly, something is wrong, but the CVE ID or IDs need to apply to a
specific aspect of the problem.

Our understanding from
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=737456#c10 is that "the
prtsc key is not disabled when the screen is locked" is intentional
behavior. Thus, that's not the root cause. It might be reasonable to
argue that, as a consequence, anyone with physical access to that key
is implicitly allowed to consume memory and disk space. In many
environments, anyone with physical access to that key also happens to
be able to turn off the computer.

There could be a CVE assignment for
https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=737456#c20 - "for that
short period of time those windows are not only shown (which is a bad
enough privacy issue on it's own), but also accept input (which makes
the already-bad issue even worse)." However, the bug discussion
doesn't suggest that there's a reasonable way to solve this within
gnome-shell itself. In other words, gnome-shell doesn't have any
direct or immediate ability to control the screen when it's not
running.

Possibly we're left with the following, which is unusual for a CVE but
still valid: "PrtSc is an unauthenticated request that's available to
untrusted parties. It's also a very expensive request. The combination
of this PrtSc behavior and the existence of the oom-killer allows
authentication bypass for command execution. Therefore, PrtSc must be
rate limited, and the lack of rate limiting is a vulnerability."
Unless there's a better alternative, the CVE ID will be assigned for
that vulnerability characterization.
