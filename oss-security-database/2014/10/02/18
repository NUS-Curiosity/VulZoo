Sure.  I absolutely didn't imply that you did anything wrong.  You have
helped a lot!

I had at least as much opportunity to insist on a different approach
early on, including to CVE assignments (and I regret I did not; to me,
those CVEs don't matter much, but clearly they do to a lot of people).

What I meant is that with hindsight maybe we could have done better, by
using whichever parser bug as an opportunity to request a CVE ID for the
parser being exposed instead.  A lot of people primarily look at CVEs,
and might miss the most important patch when it's not associated with
any CVE ID.

Maybe you fuzz yet another RCE bug, and we request a CVE ID for the
parser being exposed then? ;-)

Or maybe the CVE powers that be will find the parser being exposed
CVE-worthy without yet another PoC, especially given that upstream
already has a fix issued?  If such a CVE is issued, I'd happily refer
primarily to it instead of to all the other recent bash CVEs.

Perhaps, but (in hindsight) we should have expected that and maybe we
could have worked around it.  Maybe a lesson for next time when a
combination of important potential "hardening" change and "unimportant"
individual bug fixes comes up, in any software project.

Right.

Yeah, I hope no one installing a newer CVE-assigned parser bug upstream
patch will happen to skip the prefix/suffix upstream patch.  The fact
that these patches are numbered helps a lot here.  And I hope distros
got the message, and will include a prefix/suffix patch too (many
already did).

Yet a CVE ID for the parser previously having been exposed still makes
sense to me.
