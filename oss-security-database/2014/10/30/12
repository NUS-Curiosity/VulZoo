Sorry for the confusion here - Paul and I were actually both working on
the same issue simultaneously and without knowing it, and we both came
up with a patch and a CVE request...

So please disregard my earlier request, and let's use CVE-2014-8554
moving forward.

That said, it would be useful indeed if someone could update
CVE-2014-8554 with the data below, as this will become the "official"
reference for the issue and the fix.
