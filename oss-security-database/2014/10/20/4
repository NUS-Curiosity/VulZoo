Subject: RE: attacking hsts through ntp

The symmetric schemes do work, but due to data structure sizing only MD5 and SHA-1 hashed PSKs are supported:
http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2039

They imply in the comments that it will take a new version of the NTP RFCs to get support for stronger hashing schemes.

The protocol from RFC 5906 is completely broken:

  http://zero-entropy.de/autokey_analysis.pdf

The symmetric schemes are probably fine but hard to set up. But it looks like the NIST provides authenticated NTP:
