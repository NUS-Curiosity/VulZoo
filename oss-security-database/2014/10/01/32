Subject: Security advisory in Jenkins

Hello,

I just wanted to share that the Jenkins project issued a security advisory
today. These issues are independently found and we've aggregated into a
single release.

The relevant CVE IDs, our bug tracking IDs are available here
<https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2014-10-01>
.

The new versions can be downloaded from here
<http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/>.

(This is the first time I do this, so my apologies in advance for probably
failing to follow the expected format.)
