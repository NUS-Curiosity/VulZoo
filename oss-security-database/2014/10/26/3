The information in the comment is a bit scarce, it seems he hasn't
published his sample (?).
Anyway I checked the radare2-testsuite he was pointing to and found a
crasher in the PE parser, I don't know if this is the same one, but I
reported it upstream:
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17512

As this is a write to uninitialized memory it seems to me a CVE is
deserved.
