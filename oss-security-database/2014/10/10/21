So this doesn't get lost: I'm convinced by dkg and Kristian's
arguments: Use hkps with hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net

GnuPG 2.1 will ship with hkps enabled by default, I believe, and
Kristian's CA. (I don't think 2.0 does yet.)

I do agree about that.

And, in fact: I failed to thank you! I've used the SKS pool you
operate for many years. You provide a critical public service.

Very much agreed; my particular threat model for this *isn't*
protection against the NSA. (Aside from perhaps protection from
traffic analysis.) It's protection against much weaker threats.

One thing that one can do (which I do when I don't have a copy of a
key in one of my local keydumps) is use the strategy of Tor's
"tlsdate": use a set of servers which are unlikely to be controlled by
the same adversary.
