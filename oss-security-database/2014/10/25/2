Subject: cve request: libbfd?

Hey,

You may want to assign something to:

http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17510

This is slightly complicated by the fact that libbfd is just bad in
general and there likely are dozens of individual bugs, but the
write-to-arbitrary-pointer issues with ELF section parsing in elf.c
sort of stand out.
