Subject: attacking hsts through ntp

it's a pretty neat and simple idea:
Kill HSTS through NTP by sending victims PC into the future.

Same should work for HPKP. The idea of setting some security feature
through a header needs a revisit.
The solution would be to have a more reliable PC time. How do we do
that?
