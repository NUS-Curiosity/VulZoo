For example using something like metasploit the code would (in theory)
be more radable and anything hidden/obfuscated would stick out. My vote
would be to require well written nmap scripts or metasploit modules that
don't contain obfuscated code/etc. This would also make getting them to
work simpler (no use of weird one off CPAN modules or specific versions
of some obscure python thing, etc.).
