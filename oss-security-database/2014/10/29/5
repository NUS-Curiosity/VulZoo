This imagemagick release fixes also three issues I detected via
zzuf+asan.

I haven't found the time yet to write proper disclosures yet:
Out-of-bound memory error in resize code is CVE-2014-8354
Out-of-bound memory error in PCX decoder is CVE-2014-8355
Out-of-bound memory error in DCM decode has no CVE yet (if CVE
assigners read this they may assign one).
