Can I get one 2014 CVE for following TYPO3 extension issue, thank you.

It has been discovered that the extension "Calendar Base" (cal) is susceptible
to Denial of Service.

Release Date: October 17, 2014
Affected Versions: all versions of 0.x.x, 1.0.x, 1.1.x, 1.2.x, 1.3.x, 1.4.x;
1.5.8 and below of 1.5.x; 1.6.0

Vulnerability Type: Denial of Service
Severity: Medium
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C

Problem Description: User input is passed to PHP's PCRE library without
validating it beforehand. Depending on user input this may consume a tremendous
amount of system resources.

TYPO3 CMS 6.1.0 - 6.2.99) are available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at
