Subject: list policy (Re: Truly scary SSL 3.0 vuln to be revealed soon:)

Looks like I need to comment on the specific questions on list policy:

Whatever is sent to the list, if on-topic and otherwise appropriate
(e.g., not some non-English HTML-only message), is posted with no
artificial delay.  In this respect, the only difference from the
Full-Disclosure mailing list (as far as I understand how it's run) is
that oss-security is limited to / focused on Open Source.

While the charter does discourage some kinds of postings, this is only
being enforced for off-topic or technically inappropriate postings.

http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security#list-content-guidelines

Specifically, this says (among other things):

- Public security issues only please.  What you say here is public for
the world to see - keep that in mind.  Some kinds of embargoed
information (intended for public disclosure in at most 2 weeks) may be
disclosed to distros.

- Please don't send fully working exploits (but testcases that exercise
the flaw are welcome)

FWIW, I've always been tempted to remove the latter guideline, but as
you can see I left it around for now.  (Someone else in this community
wrote it.)

Like I said, these two guidelines above are not actually being enforced
during message moderation.  They're merely polite requests/reminders.

> What is this list's policy on sourced/unsourced security rumors?

No specific policy - I don't think it's ever been discussed so far.
Personally, I'd like on-topic rumors to be posted in here, with due
warnings on how unreliable the information might be.

There are a lot of people in here (as well as "on lists like this"),
with different opinions.  In this thread, we've only seen one person
suggest anything like you describe.

Personally, I find this ridiculous, as do many others.  (No offense
intended.)  Just off Twitter:

<i0n1c> Seriously? People are discussing on OSS if it is irresponsible to discuss SSL3 vulnerability while someone kept it under embargo.

Of course, even having this sort of discussion makes us look ridiculous.
Yet if a list member wanted to post this "reflection", it should have
been posted, and it was.
