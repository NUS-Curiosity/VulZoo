I've argued for that since... 2008!
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=450280

Basically that's one of the scary parts of this:
1. We have an in-protocol downgrade mechanism
2. People develop broken SSL implementations that don't work with that
3. Browsers have a non-protocol workaround that allows out-of-protocol
downgrades
4. These downgrades cause compatibility issues
5. People put more duct tape around this workaround (that's not part of
the protocol) by inventing a new protocol (SCSV) that adds more
complexity to TLS
6. These downgrades cause security issues (NOT the first time!
One of the Blackhat Virtual Host Confusion attacks also relied on these
downgrades)

Basically I'd group POODLE together with BERserk as the "we could've
avoided it"-vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS.
