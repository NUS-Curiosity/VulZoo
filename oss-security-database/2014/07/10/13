Good point.  Perhaps the documentation of AcceptEnv needs to be revised
to mention this exception.

Actually, it is avoidable.  Yes, there is:

	if (s->term)
		child_set_env(&env, &envsize, "TERM", s->term);

but there's also:

static int
session_pty_req(Session *s)
{
[...]
	if (no_pty_flag || !options.permit_tty) {
		debug("Allocating a pty not permitted for this authentication.");
		return 0;
	}
[...]
	s->term = packet_get_string(&len);

So it looks like listing "no-pty" in authorized_keys prevents not only
allocation of a pty, but also passing of TERM.  And this makes sense.
