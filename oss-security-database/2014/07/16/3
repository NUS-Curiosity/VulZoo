Yesterday,

https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/46778

and

https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/46778/diff/pack.c

were publicly readable, but today both of them result in a "Ruby Issue
Tracking System" login screen. We're not sure how to interpret this,
e.g., maybe all of 46778 has become private because the "different
issue affecting Ruby 2.0 and 2.1" is now embargoed?
