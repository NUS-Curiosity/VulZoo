It's reasonable to assume that reporter did not touch the "Backport:"
field at all.  The issue was reported for ruby 2.1.2p168 (see the "ruby
-v" field).  Backport value was original set to:

  2.0.0: UNKNOWN, 2.1: UNKNOWN

which happens to be the default value pre-filed into the field for you
by the bug tracker when you try create a new issue.  You can easily
check by visiting:

https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/issues/new

All changes from UNKNOWN to REQUIRED were not done by the reporter, as
you can see from the bug comments.

I don't think you can draw the conclusion based on the Backport field.
