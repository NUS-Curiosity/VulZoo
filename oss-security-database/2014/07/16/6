Subject: CVE request: libressl before 2.0.2 under linux PRNG failure

Hi,

This has made the news lately:
https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/libressls_prng_is_unsafe_on_linux

Should get a CVE. Affected is portable libressl 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 on
Linux. 2.0.2 has been released:
https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=140548206911600&w=2

Under certain conditions forking a process can create repeated random
numbers.

LibreSSL 2.0.2 contains a workaround, although the reporter of this
issue thinks this may not be the best approach.

Please assign CVE.

cu,
