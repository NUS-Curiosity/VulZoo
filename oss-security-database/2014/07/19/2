Yes, see CVE-2014-4039 in

   http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/17/1

   and

   http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4039

Here, a technical-support tool (very similar in purpose to sosreport)
makes a copy of a mode 0600 /var/log/messages file within a
(potentially) mode 0644 /tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz archive file.
There can realistically be usernames and passwords in
/var/log/messages, at least when that log file is used by poorly
written site-specific software. Thus, a CVE can be assigned.

A CVE could also be assigned if there wasn't a mode 0644 local file,
but the archive containing /var/log/messages was transmitted
externally in a "technical-support data stream" (as in CVE-2014-4040).

Incidentally, some vendors assign a CVE ID if one of their products
logs a password to a file that has default permissions of 0600, even
if the vendor's documentation says that the customer must not change
the permissions. Their rationale is that the password logging was a
security-relevant implementation error. At some point, it comes down
to the vendor understanding its own customers. If they know that
customers ignore the documentation and use 0644 instead, this would be
a reasonable motivation for declaring the coding error to be
security-relevant.
