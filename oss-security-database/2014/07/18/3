Subject: CVE Request: bozohttpd: basic http authentication bypass

Hi

Can a CVE be assigned for the following bozohttpd basic http
authetication bypass vulnerability? It was fixed in bozohttpd version
20140708. Quoting NetBSD advisory:

> Abstract
> ========
> 
> When checking for restricted access via .htpasswd files, bozohttpd
> fails to properly check for truncation, allowing specially crafted
> requests to bypass access control without a password.  Files of
> length 10 or more are not affected.
> 
> 
> Technical Details
> =================
> 
> A call to snprintf() was not properly checking for truncation of
> a provided user path, allowing a later concatenation of the
> ".htpasswd" file name to exceed the maximum pathname length.  This
> stops the check for .htpasswd file from working correctly, bypassing
> the basic HTTP authentication scheme.  Files with names longer than
> ".htpasswd" are not visible as they require at least enough for a
> valid path to be available.
