I've been meaning to post a follow-up on the other request by IBM to
join (linux-)distros.  Unfortunately, I am in too bad a lack of time
right now.  So no changes in subscriber lists in August.  I intend to
revisit this topic in September.

I do feel that IBM joining one of these lists makes sense, but this and
the details need to be discussed.
