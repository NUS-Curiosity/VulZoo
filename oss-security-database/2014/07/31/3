Subject: CVE Request: XML-DT: Insecure use of temporary files

Hi

Steve Kemp reported to to the Debian BTS in [1] that the XML-DT Perl
module distribution contains mkdtskel and mkxmltype using insecurely
temporary files using the pid of the process in the temporary file
name.

 [1] https://bugs.debian.org/756566

Could a CVE be assigned for this issue?

Regards,
Salvatore
