Subject: Possible CVE Request: MediaWiki Security and Maintenance Releases:
 1.19.18, 1.22.9 and 1.23.2

Hi

New Security and maintenance releases for mediawiki (1.19.18, 1.22.9
and 1.23.2) were released:

http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-announce/2014-July/000157.html

>From the announcement, three SECURITY tagged bugs were fixed.

Are CVE assignments for those already been requested, or if not, could
you assign CVEs for these?

Regards,
Salvatore
