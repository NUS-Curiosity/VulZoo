None have been requested or assigned.

* (bug 68187) SECURITY: Prepend jsonp callback with comment.
** This was hardening against CVE-2014-4671, I don't think CVEs are
being assigned for these?

* (bug 66608) SECURITY: Fix for XSS issue in bug 66608: Generate the
URL used for loading a new page in Javascript,instead of relying on
the URL in the link that has been clicked.
** Standard Dom XSS. Credit goes to Michael M.

* (bug 65778) SECURITY: Copy prevent-clickjacking between OutputPage
and ParserOutput.
** This probably should get a CVE, since downstreams will all want to
patch this. We prevent iframing certain pages to prevent clickjacking
/ redressing attacks, but when those pages were transcluded into
non-protected pages, the resulting page could be iframed. Credit goes
to Kevin Israel.
