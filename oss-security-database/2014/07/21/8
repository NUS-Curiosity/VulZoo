This is about the glib part and the alias processing, right?

iconv/gconv_charset.h:strip() normalizes the transliteration argument to 
iconv_open, so the resulting file names follow a particular pattern, and 
there cannot be enough slashes to ascend to a writable directory.

Hmm.  How likely is that?  It overflows in to malloc metadata, and the 
glibc malloc hardening should catch that these days.
