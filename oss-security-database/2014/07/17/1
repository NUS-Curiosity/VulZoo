Subject: CVE-2014-4943: Linux privilege escalation in ppp over l2tp sockets

CVE-2014-4943 is a flaw in the Linux kernel allowing an unprivileged user
to escalate to kernel privilege when CONFIG_PPPOL2TP is enabled. If built
as a module, a work-around to limit this to just the root user would be
to add this to /etc/modprobe.conf:

alias pppox-proto-1 off
blacklist l2tp_ppp
