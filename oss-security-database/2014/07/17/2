Subject: [OSSA 2014-024] Use of non-constant time comparison operation
 (CVE-2014-3517)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-024
CVE: CVE-2014-3517
Date: July 17, 2014
Title: Use of non-constant time comparison operation
Reporter: Alex Gaynor (Rackspace)
Products: Nova
Versions: Up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 to 2014.1.1

Alex Gaynor from Rackspace reported a timing attack vulnerability in Nova.  
By analyzing response times to requests for instance metadata, an attacker 
may be able to guess a valid instance ID signature. This could allow access 
to important configuration details of another instance. Only setups 
configured to proxy metadata requests via Neutron are affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:

Notes:

2013.2.4 and 2014.1.2 releases
